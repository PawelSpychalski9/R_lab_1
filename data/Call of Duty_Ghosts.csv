Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Would've been better if the whole entire game was about Riley the dog.  Also, Infinity Ward, PLEASE make a DLC where you take Riley to PetSmart and you get him groomed! "

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD Ghosts is the newest installment of the game series that consistently fails to address the gameplay problems of previous installments, while adding â€œrevolutionaryâ€ new features that add nothing to the quality of gameplay. To get the full experience, stab yourself repeatedly in the eyeballs and genitalia with a rusty HIV infected syringe and send me your $59.99 instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best crash to desktop simulator I've ever played.  Hardest boss is bashing the F key.  10/10 would crash and bash again.  Side note: The story in the single player campaign isn't half bad, to be honest. Just a shame that the poor optimization makes you rage."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay, I'm preparing my self for this being a very unpopular review; but here goes. Please also bare in mind that this review is purely and solely based on the single player side of the game - I will touch on the multiplayer side but only briefly.   Call of Duty: Ghost is the tenth game in the COD series, and was released in 2013 on PC, PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, and then re-released on launch of PS4 and Xbox One.   This was my first COD game that I had played in a while, so the problems people have had with the gameplay becoming stale and lack of innovation didn't effect me so much. Yes the gameplay is very much the same as all of the other Call of Duty games, however I still had fun whilst playing it. I have yet to play the multiplayer, and to be honest, I probably won't. The single player campaign follows the character of Logan Walker. You also play as Baker, Elias Walker (your father) and a new addition of playing as a combat dog, Riley. There are no new elements to be seen in the gameplay, its very 'Call of Duty', aim and shoot is pretty much the whole game with the odd quick time event thrown in. There are some really interesting levels when you are in space and underwater, however my favorite levels were the vehicle based ones; where you take control over tanks and helicopters - they add a little something extra to the game in my opinion, breaking up the monotony of the classic ground troop fights.   Graphically, Ghosts is very dated; I was playing on 4K resolution, and it still looked very poor. Textures when close up are so low res it's hard to imagine this is a game which was released in 2013. The game uses an engine which was used in previous COD releases, but with apparent 'significant upgrades', however I don't really see a difference in graphic fidelity in Ghosts and any of the other 'recent' COD games.   Ghost had a story which kept me interested right until the end, however I felt that the game's ending really did not do the game any justice. I really felt like I was getting a big two fingers up to me when it happened. Not sure whether people will class it as a spoiler, but the cliffhanger at the end really relies on there being a sequel in the Ghost franchise, however unlikely that will be. Up until the end though, it is a compelling story - maybe if you quit just before the end credits you'll enjoy it more!   This is another game where you will not die or fail on the single player mode; you are with a squad of other characters for the majority of the game; and you could very easily just sit back and watch the fire fights if you were so inclined and you would still not fail. Even when playing on higher difficulties, there is no real ramp in the challenges on show.   With the games extremely linear level design, it leaves you very little time to explore the world in front of you, that being said, there is no reason to want to either though. There are one set of 'collectibles' to be on the look out for, and that's it - I guess it is to be expected from a COD game though. It would of been nice to maybe find little bits of extra plot and story through hacking computers, finding files etc.   The single player mode took me just about seven hours to finish - I thought that was an OK length for the game; I wasn't growing tired of the gameplay by the end of the game but there is no reason at all to play it through for a second time - expect of course if you want to play on a higher difficulty; but even then, I wouldn't say it's worth it. Where you are going to get your mileage out of any COD game is the multiplayer - however I still don't plan on playing it simply because I am not interested in the multiplayer side of many games.   Technically I didn't have any bugs or issues whilst playing. I was able to play on a steady 60 fps on 4k resolution the whole play through. At times the frame rate was even in the 100s. It certainly looks like the PC version of the game came out on top of the consoles on the technical side of things, since the consoles could barely even achieve 60 fps on lower resolutions, Xbox could only handle 720p. This game is better off being played with a keyboard and mouse, however the lack of FOV sliders did make me feel a little bit nauseous with the camera swaying around all of the time when moving. You can change this in .ini settings but in this day in age, PC games need a FOV slider as compulsory in my opinion.   In conclusion, whilst there may seem to be more negatives than positives in my review for Ghosts, I did have a lot of fun whilst playing it, however the price of Â£39,99 is absolutely ridiculously especially for a game which has been out almost two years now. If like me you are just going to play the single player mode, wait for the game to be around Â£10, but if you are going to be jumping into the multiplayer side of things (there is still a very active community out there too!) I would happily say you can pick this up for anything below Â£15 - since you will get the seven hour single player as well as many many hours of CODs core element, multiplayer.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away   2) Only recommended when on sale   3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play  If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is GARBAGE.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so bad. Buy now.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This one might just kill the COD series for good. Absolutely NO support and a hackfest. Save your money for something else.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Average fish A.I. simulator.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad Rats is better.  EDIT***  Since this review got popular for some reason, allow me to give some insight to this mess of a game. I know it says 1 hour on record but I have 34~ hours on multiplayer.  The story isnt necissarily bad, its just that this isnt their most original game *COUGH* reskinned cutscenes *COUGH*   The game is clunky and obviously rushed. The framerate is terrible on all multiplayer maps and even worse, the wretched community of this game. Dont get me wrong, I love COD as much as the next f4gg0tron_n00bskopre, but really, the community is terrible.  People will defend this game (see comments) and call me fake, but honestly, why would you defend this? Play a real pc game and see the light that is not COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BEWARE: There were no ghosts in this game, very misleading.   10/10 Would be be a dog again. ^.^"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: ghosts, them most amazing and lagtastic fun you'll have in a life time. With is poor optimization and crappy servers you'll be sure that you won't be getting the best experience ever! 11/10 would reccomend this this game to be brought from a store and used as a frisbee for your dog!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will divide this review into technical and gameplay sections.  Technical: Ghosts is poorly optimized for PC - whether or not a PC can run it is extremely unpredictable. Two identical PCs may not be equal in the ability to run it; and also a cheap non-gaming office laptop like mine can run it well enough to be playable (and has never crashed since purchased in February 2014), while the game may fail miserably on a good gaming rig which runs other demanding games well.  Gameplay: Multiplayer: at the time of writing, number of players online is fluctuating approximately between 200-800. If you play popular game modes like TDM, for me, I have never had any problems finding a game. Other game modes or DLC maps is difficult to impossible.  Ghosts is probably the most different COD since COD4MW - bigger maps, map layout not typical of other CODs, and the weapons and movement physics have more inertia/weight to it, thus a very slight slant towards the BF3/BF4 feel. You either love it or hate it. I have 6 CODS since COD4MW, and 8 BF games - being also a BF fan, I happen to like these characteristics of Ghosts, while most COD fans really hate it for these same reasons.  AI emulating 'multiplayer' matches: A significant number of players play and enjoy Ghosts for these feature - setting up private matches with AI (or bots), or playing the 'Squads' mode - where you can configure in detail your whole AI squad and challenge other players' squads. While this is essentially you and a bunch of bots in your team and the other, you can still rank up via this method. While any idiot knows that playing with bots will NEVER be the same with multiplayer with human players, Ghosts bots are among the best out there (comparable to CSGO bots or maybe better? You be the judge) and these bot matches can be fun.  Should you buy it? Due to its unpredictability as mentioned above, you are taking a risk. I managed to test it during a free weekend, and spent many hours to finally be sure I can make it work on my very humble PC before buying it. Apart from trying on a free weekend (which wonâ€™t happen anymore for Ghosts), no matter how powerful your PC is, there is a big enough risk that it may be problematic - so its a gamble purchase technical-wise.  Gameplay: if you want classic COD, this is not it. But if you want something different than the rest of the CODs, this may be fun for you. I am in the minority who likes the gameplay - but at the same time, I already have another 5 COD titles to play with for classic COD gameplay).  Campaign: I can't comment on this since I never play any games' campaign.  So, technical wise, buying Ghosts is a gamble because how powerful your PC is may not be the only factor which decides whether or not it will run well.  Gameplay wise, Ghosts is not the typical classic COD, and most people hate it. The question is whether you belong in the majority or the minority - which will end with you hating or loving it.  I belong to the minority, and my preference is purely personal taste of course. And I am the lucky ones who got Ghosts to run well enough on my potato for me to have fun. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,like sonic '06 with guns
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I sold my soul to buy this game so I feel obligated to play it. Hail satan. 10/10

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"EDIT: I actually have 18 hours played, not 0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tom Clancy really got it this time. If you are looking for an uber-realistic, fist person shooter, then this is the game for you!   Call of Duty: Black Ghost Recon is the 666th installment of this series. It has first-class graphics (I can't even tell if it's real or not!) and there's no glitches as many of you have seen in many other games. I have so much fun playing this and have never gotten mad at it.    The Next-Gen Engine from 2025 is still going strong, even though it's -11 years old. I can't believe that Infinity Arch made a whole new engine in such short notice! It's also a really great improvement and makes Counter Strike look like a pile of poo.    As far as hacking goes, I haven't seen many of them becaues the loomynarty comes and saves the day most of the time. Also, IF there is a hacker in the game, the Tom Clancy Valve community calmly and nicely tells him/her to go away and play Combat Arms. That game gets hacked so much anyways.   Speaking of the community, they are really, really nice people. No matter how old/young, sex, religion, and race you are, you get treated with respect.   All in all, the game is great fun and I definitely suggest you get this game for you and all of your friends.   P.S. Tom Clancy RIP in peace :`("

Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game has a graphics option just for dog hair. If high quality dog hair doesnt sell this game I dont know what will. 15/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible PC port, can't even ajust FOV. Completely unispired, brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Wait, there's a snoop dog voice pack? 10/10 would buy again."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'll start by saying that unlike most people i play COD for the single-player, and COD ghosts has a good one! it's darker than the older entries in the series. The US isn't the world's only superpower and is fighting and losing war. rather than focusing the on usual american patriotism Ghosts focuses on the family of two brothers, their father and their dog Riley. and the part they play in the war against the federation. Which made me care about the characters more. Also it doesn't have the usual COD ending and may surprise you! Ghosts has some very creative mission designs with trilling settings like outer space and deep sea combat, tank and helicopter missions as well as some tense moments like when after a plane crash you're scouring through the jungle or guiding Riley behind enemy lines. The game ran well, never crashed and i didn't experience any bugs. Graphically it looks beautiful. Overall it plays, looks and feels great, after beating the main campaign i felt refreshed and hoping for a sequel. This game doesn't deserve the hatred that it received. If you're looking for a good modern FPS with a good story and gameplay i would highly recommend Call of duty ghosts!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hello!I paid for this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 30$ and Now I have game that must download for 7 hours and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Dog with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing name Rayle.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If it's the Single player campaign you're after .. this is not a terrible game at that. the story is somewhat engaging and fun.   Now to the Multiplayer :  the performace issues the game had back in it start are fixed .. for the most part, but the player base is almost non existent now sadly, the game offers a lot of game mods, zombies mods, clan vs clan matches and more but sadly there's no one to enjoy all this features with. Team Deathmatch is still alive barly :p with some 300 or less players so the game doesn't have much choice to choose the best game for you. expect lag sometimes,  Also, cheaters .. yes. there are those too. not in every game but you're going to meet them.   The good:  - not that bad as people make it look like - lot of value for a cod game (but like i said, no players to enjoy all that stuff with them)  - okay single player  The Bad:  - maps are huge .. for a cod game, so campers are x10.  - suffring from low player base (even though it's 3 years old, it's not that old to be this empty)  - cheaters - zero double xp events or anything to bring the community to play again sadly.   verdict: unless you have to get this (for story or whatever) don't buy it for more than $10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, I don't get the hate for this game. It's a good CoD with a brilliant campaign, and the multiplayer is really DECENT. One thing is sure anyway, you can have hours of fun in this game easily."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why but unlike the other people i really enjoyed playing the Multiplayer. Sadly the game died so soon, especially on PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It was worth the $7 I paid for it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why this game has received so many bad reviews because I found the single player campaign really good!  The variation with past, present, space, helicopters and tanks helped making Ghosts to be a more diverse game than normal as well.  However, I don't play multi player so I can't score the game on that, and that's perhaps where some people have given it a thumbs down?  I for one thought it was one of the better instalments of Call of Duty - from a single player campaign point of view..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I originally reviewed this game back in June of 2015. I did not recommend this game because of the bandwagon of people giving this game negative feedback. At the time, I did agree with them, but throughout the almost 3 years since release of this game, my opinion has changed.  Let's start of by saying that this game is by no means in the top Call of Duty games. It is probably ranked towards the bottom of that list compared to other CoD games. Even by saying that I am not saying that this game is bad, just not as great as the ones to come before it.  My original opinion of this game was accurate. When Call of Duty: Ghosts was the newest game in the series, it was absolutely terrible. I never even hit first prestige and never went back to play the campaign a second time (until now).  After suffering through the past two years with two respectively bad Call of Duty games, I have actually come back to this game to experience storyline another time. The campaign of Advanced Warfare was outstanding, but the multiplayer was disgusting. The campaign of Black Ops III was disgusting and the multiplayer was alright. Let's just say I came back to this game to relive a good campaign again. I was tired of the super futuristic garbage that the recent games have offered.  If I was reviewing this game soley on singleplayer, I would give it a 9/10, but since the multiplayer was poor and the general community disliked it, I rate the entire game a 8/10. The storyline does keep the multiplayer from sinking the game.    My original review went something like this:  Call of Duty: Ghosts is by far the worst COD in a while. The campaign seems recycled, yet still playable and enjoyable. The mulitplayer is just plain bad.. Like I hate it.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wasted my money on this one, frame freeze and stutter drives me nuts. This will be my last COD title. The lack of off-line play and single player options is a major reason for me to avoid titles dedicated to multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Only good thing in this game is Snoop Dogg.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Qualities of this game surprised me.   Singleplayer campaign was fun. Missions were diverse with excellent pacing. One of the best modern COD campaigns out there.   It's a pity that mp playerbase is so small. There's no problem finding team deathmatch and hardcore team deathmatch, but that's pretty much it. I would love to try the other game mods but it's impossible to find enough players. Nevertheless TDM is fun too, reworked perks are refreshing, there are lots of possibilities in gun and gear customisation. Maps change during the match making matches more dynamic and alive.  I don't get all the hate this game got.  If you like 'popcorn' shooters and see this game in discount, take it. Even if it were just for the singleplayer - it's worth it. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Every year a new Call Of Duty game comes out and me and a lot of other people buy it just because we blindly trust this franchise to be the best FPS game.  I was very skeptical about getting this game after seeing some videos of the gameplay, But silly me, I WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO BUY THE DIGITAL DELUXE EDITION!  Massive launch issues, horrendous amount of bugs and issues with the game, and the copy paste from the other games is really obvious this time.  Do PC gamers get any benefit from having such great specs ? HELL NO, infinity ward poops on all of us PC gamers with them not giving a single FU*CK about the issues in the game, and the game isn't looking any better from the previous COD games, this game is a shame that it is considered as a next gen game!  Bottom line, COD is now in an unenviable situation after their promises to bring a new different FPS game.   Biggest disappointment of 2013..  4 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty : Ghosts is the most underrated game of all time, it's actually a great single player experience. It has up to 18 bots for multiplayer with varying difficulties. Extinction is refreshing and feels different from zombies but definitely a lot of fun. The campaign is serviceable and just enough for a COD game, with some cool set pieces and expolsive gunfights.  the multiplayer is ok at best it has a wide variety of customization options, gorgeous graphics, perfect hit detection, awesome killstreaks, and most importantly no wallrunning or double jumping BS.  Call of Duty : Ghosts is not terrible just extremely overhyped."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game because a) it was cheap b) I was a general fan of CoD (Single player).  I had heard lots of bad news about this game well before I got it, and while it won't win any GoTY awards from me, it was another solid CoD game with the normal memorable set pieces and cut scenes. Having a new universe to play in was a refreshing change.  As an achievement hunter, this game is great as they aren't too hard to tick off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Rating - 76/100 Recommendation - Campaign makes Michael Bay look like Woody Allen  Disclaimer: I have zero interest in the multiplayer campaign. This review specifically covers the single player campaign, and is specifically FOR people who only want the single player campaign. There's co-op horde mode too, apparently, but I haven't gotten to try it yet. Oh, also, fair warning: Default FoV is VERY narrow, and is only changeable in multiplayer (which doesn't carry over).  Call of Duty is often at the center of video game controversy, and you would be hard-pressed to find any other series that can elicit such strong reactions from people. Reviews are usually either 10/10 or 0/10, and you will likely have friends groan at you if you claim to be a fan. There are no series other than sports that get pumped out with such regularity, and with so few innovations from game to game. It seems like sales of one game haven't even gotten a chance to cool off yet before another new one is announced. By all outward appearances, this is a terrible terrible series.  You know what, though? I have a soft spot in my heart for Call of Duty. It's a big dumb oaf of a series that you just can't help but smile at. It's very much a Hollywood Summer blockbuster movie, with non-stop action and explosions from the outset, getting your blood pumping while you're in the moment, and then making you go '...what was that?' when you're done.  Case in point, Ghosts. I played through the entire campaign in 5 hours (with very minimal repeating of sections), and was in a town that was getting bombed, then in space, then back in the bombed town, then on a military base, then scuba diving, then on a ship, then driving a tank, then doing bombing runs in an airship, then in space again, then fighting on an inverted high-speed train. While all that is going on, I was switching back and forth between past and present, and controlling probably 5 different characters (or at least it felt like it). The plot and action literally do not stop to even take a breath. How can you not love that!??  You should know what to expect when you're looking at a CoD game, and this one delivers.  I'm not fully up to speed on all the Call of Duty games' campaigns, but I have played a decent number of them, and this is one of the best if you're looking for a shallow, explosion-fueled adrenaline rush. If you want to feel like John Rambo, John McClane, and John Woo somehow had a baby whose life is being directed by Michael Bay, then look no further.  The graphics won't win any awards, but they're good and well-optimized (60fps at 4k maxed with a 980), sound design is solid, the gunplay is as good as ever, and there are tons of little one-and-done gadgets you get to play with throughout. If you're just here to hate all over Call of Duty, then downvote and move on, but if you're looking for some mindless action, I highly recommend this one.  It's hokey, it's fake as all get out, and it may represent all that is wrong with the video gaming market, but damn it all if it isn't fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts is the leading tank simulator of this generation. Its realistic phyiscs engine and highly accurate depictions put all other wannabe simulators to shame. An M1 Abrams going 100km/h on rough terrain with perfect accuracy? You betcha! That same tank being able to round corners with a tight circle whilst going at that top speed? Just like in real life!  If you're after a highly realistic modern military shooter with excellent physics, you'll love Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great waste of money for a multiplayer that doesn't even work!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought on the cheap for only $4,50. For such a price, this game is excellent, heh"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's actually the best Call Of Duty... It just needs more players...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I currntly have the game for 3 systems, including the PC.  I must admit, I didnt truly admire what they were doing until I played Black ops 3, and realized that Ghosts was actually the true evolution in Gameplay for the franchise. The slides were perfect, as well as the corner leaning mechanic which was largely overlooked.  the story was very well done, aside from the ending, to which there will be no sequel. The amount of detail that went into the levels was staggering, and the large maps in multiplayer cater to new gameplay styles. I am not one for camping, but some people are, but it adds to the creepy 'am I going to survive' moments.  Honestly, I would love to have a group of people who just play games like this, and we play together. lets start a group that supports this game and its maps, and just play once a week or more. thanks for reading, add me and message me, and we can hopefully get something started. maybe it can spread to other games like this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i just finished the Campain there is, and i must say, it might be a short one, but it keeps you on your toes about 90% of the time..   i personally would recommend the single player aspect of the game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I had more fun having sex with a bowl of angry ant's than playing this game. 9/11
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So I heard that this was debatably the worst Call of Duty game out there, so I bought a key off of a site and decided to give it a whirl, and to be honest, I actually kinda like it.  This review will center around the muliplayer specifically, as I havent played enough of the Extinction and Campaign modes to form a solid opinion.  TL;DR: It's a fun MP experience. It has some upsides and some downsides, but I have enjoyed it thus far. Buy it on sale or from a site though, because $60 is way too much.  MP Pros: 1. Fast-paced as hell 2. The guns are cool and fun to use (especially the snipers). 3. Strike packages are back 4. It's just plain fun. 5. Lots of custimization 6. Squad Pts are now used to buy guns/attacthments, meaning you no longer need to wait to unlock everything, as nearly everything is open for unlock from the very start, be it guns, attachments, new killstreaks, Squad Members, etc. 7. Field Orders are interesting, to say the least.  MP Cons: 1. Guard Dog KS is douchey and unfair 2. I.E.D.s EVERYWHERE; they are hard to spot and you'll only know they're there once they kill you 3. Large map size and design heavily promotes camping 4. TTK is pretty fast, resulting in the afforementioned fast paced gameplay. This is fine on smaller maps (i.e Strikezone), but on larger maps (i.e Stonehaven) it becomes annoying to roam the map, find one guy, maybe get killed by the guy, rinse and repeat. 5. Sadly, not too many people online, usually 500/600 tops. You'll usually find a TDM or Strikezone 24/7 match with ease, but other modes are deserted, which is a real shame, as I heard that Ghosts' Gun Game was awesome, and nobody plays it. 6. The squad points are cool, but for some people they could disrupt the whole ranking up process.  Overall, I recommend this game. There are some good things and some pretty screwed up bad things , but I still have enjoyed myself thus far. I have only played a bit of Campaign and Extinction, but I have heard a lot of mixed opinions about the two, more so with Extinction.This is a pretty solid MP experience, but I don't honestly think its worth the hefty $60 tag. I'd recommend purchasing it either during a sale or off of a reliable site that sells games for cheap, as I was able to get the key for this game for about $7, which is a pretty good price. Just keep in mind that the playerbase will unfortunately only shrink gradually from here, so see if your friends want to play with you in case you can't find a game. There's also the occasional cheater, but nothing that we haven't seen before about 2,000 times, and I haven't run into too many cheaters so far.  Verdict: 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun. I like playing the offline (against bots) free for alls, and team death matches. Reminds me of the old days playing CounterStike againsts bots. I know some people hate bot play - but seriously I hate playing online against raging losers and cheaters. Simple polite bots are perfect game play friends."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghost was good..... and by that the only good thing about this game are the singleplayer / campaign, it has good settings , good character and a good story.  Whilst the other two are the reasons that bring the tittle down, Multiplayer was horribly executed and the the extinction are so - so and somewhat boring  thumbed up for the singleplayer not for the other two 2/5 tfw when dogs are more deadly"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've read some of the reviews and I noticed that the only people that want to review it are the people that dont like this game or have some negative thing to say.  Story I bought the game knowing what to expect. Story line's are all the same when it comes to first person shooters so don't expect to find something differet from betral, revenge, singular bad guy with bad organization, etc ... Utimately their all the same. So if you expect some great thing from the story line then be disappointed. I did like that you could play as the dog and that you got to control the turret gun during the game.  Multiplayer What do you expect? Maps, Campers, and DLC. That's what most and all future games will contain. So don't complain. This is the only thing I have a problem with and that's the power of the guns are not well balanced. While on previous games the Sniper rifles are powerful in very long ranges it seems that the SMG have replaced all uses for Assult rifles, Large Machine Guns, Shotguns, Marksman rifles and Sniper Rifles. There are no uses for these weapons. True that these are used occasionally but the SMG is by far the most powerful weapons on the games and its a little ridiculous that a smg, which shoots an array of bullets will be accurate in its precision.  2) Lack of Anti air rockets or Lock on rockets. WHY is this bad? Because we're forced to shoot most Helicopters down.  3) Maniac. The power to run real fast and stab people. C'mon the hell kind of stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this. If i want to play FPS fantasy I'll play halo. Its like the new Call of Duty i think it has jet packs. Sounds to me like Halo 4. This is what brought me to the Call of Duty franchise the realism. I understand the Juggernaut because its a suit of armor.  4) Other little things that bug me. Maybe I'm too over analytical about these things but I beleive in making forward progress not just spitting out games for the money and taking a step backwards on creativity and originality.  I do love multiplayer, for what it is at the core(shooting the enemy team) and i've played this game for a very long time but the guns are the overall thing that does it for me. SMG ARE TOO POWERFUL IN MULTIPLAYER."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game blows
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'You're right, Elias, I'm not a Ghost... I'm the man that hunts them, and sends them back to the other side!'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the most underrated Call of Duty's in my opinion. It's not all that bad. People didn't give this one a chance!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a great game! It has it all, a fantastic Journey to say the least. Truly an all time favorite. I can't begin to imagine the work and the skill involved in this masterpiece. Thanks"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just remember to kiss your family and friends goodbye before picking up your copy of Ghosts.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Eeeeh, a lukewarm thumbs up as opposed to thumbs down. I'd give the single player campaign about a 65 to 70. My least favorite CoD campaign so far. It starts off with some interesting additions and sights, novel ideas with the dog, but it quickly devolves into the same loud shouting corridor shooter every CoD is. Basically, it felt all around 'okay'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would like to begin this review with how i don't understand how i've heard so many dislikes about this game when it came out. A few days ago i just wanted to try this game out for myself, let's see what people actually mean, won't we?! After 3 playthroughs and 40/40 achievements later, i still don't understand how people don't like this COD game?!  I loved all of it, the guns, the sounds and ofcourse the storyline!  And i do recommend people who haven't played it yet, to actually just try it yourself! Whatever you've heard about it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Ghosts campaign [9/10] One Of The Best Games I've Ever Played + AMAZING STORY [10/10] + Sexy Gameplay [9/10] + Good Graphics [8/10] + Lovely Game Characters [10/10] + Nice cutscenes [7/10] ----------------------------------------- Call Of Duty Ghosts Multiplayer [7/10] (The Good) + Nice Weapons + No Exo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ + Good Stuff To Upgrade  (The Bad) - Not Lots Of Players
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you're a singleplayer guy like me, then you should absolutely ignore all the negative reviews and get this.   While the setting demands quite some suspense of disbelief (US in a losing war against a 'South American Federation'), and the story is no more than standard fare, the campaign is still a *very* enjoyable action romp. We get to fight with the usual special ops tactical team, climbing skyscrapers, stealthing through the Amazonas, infiltrating enemy installations - but also as tank commanders, helicopter pilots, as divers, and even in space - the whole shebang.   Also, we have a dog - how cool is that?  It's still a straight shooter, though: no 'safe house' with thousands of useless 'crafting' and costume thingies (like in BO3), and no inclusion of 'strategy' game elements (like the out of place 'strike force' missions in BO2). I for one appreciate that, sometimes less really is more.   The graphics are very good (much better than BO2 and at least on par with BO3) and the controls feel precise and responsive, with a controller at least. I especially like the lean-and-peak-(and-shoot) from cover where the possibility to do so is highlighted by an unobtrusive yellow arrow.   Granted, you will see the end credits after about 8 hours already, but there's alot of replay value due to the variety in mission design. In contrast to BO3 this game will stay on my hard disc for replaying the campaign every now and then."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is absolutely amazing! The graphics is great, and the campaign is awesome! Can't wait for Ghosts 2! II think that this game should win because of it's great story mode, gameplay and excellent graphics!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool game idk why its has so much negative rewiews but personally i think this game is good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game! loved the storyline
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fantastic game, I loved it. Great graphics and heaps of action with location variations from 'Outer Space' to 'Ocean Operations' and of course on 'Dry Land Battles'. You also have a variety of shooting modes from 'Helicopters', 'Operating Tanks', 'Swimming Missions' and plenty of city based stealth operations which all offer a great deal of action variety.  Topping up ammo is not an option for your original weapon, but when you get low just pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy. Thing with this is that not all of them carry like items between themselves, so if you want to pick up extra ammo you will need to find another gun the same or swap again. I didn't find this to be a problem but it helps to keep an eye on the situation and not run too low before it is too late. You also have the use of a very effective dog who at times can be controlled by you for attack and recon duties and this is a lot of fun.  I finished it in 7 hours and that was not rushing through, was hoping for at least twice that so as to have decent sized SP mode. Unfortunately as happens with too many games these days, Multiplayer Rules which also means all DLC's for this game support MP only. As I don't do MP, I (and many people like me) miss out once again on expanding the base game with extra missions......This is my only complaint.  Would I recommend this?.....Most definitely and rate it 8/10 and mainly due to the shortness of SP gameplay. It left me with the feeling of 'I want to play this again'....And soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"ODIN to Ground Control, We're under attack by some Federation a-holes, They're using our weapons against us, We're going down and our country's defenseless.  ODIN's gone berserk, America's collapsed, Like a Roland Emmerich film except it's not so sad, My brother Hesh and I get rescued by our dad, He was a soldier but he's never seen sh*t get this bad. Ten years down the road the USA is dirt, The South American Federation made us hurt. After meeting with some Ghosts we find Ajax, Our base in Santa Monica gets wrecked and attacked.  You two know me as dad, but I'm the number one Ghost, Ever since you were babies, I've been slitting them throats. I want you in the club so start wearing some masks, So we can catch our ex-partner and shoot his â™¥â™¥â™¥.  So we're going on the hunt to find Rorke's crew, While our dog Riley finds some soldiers' throats to chew.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Literaly Hitler
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call Of Duty: Ghosts...  I'm sure I'm not the only person who's given this game hate because the next guy does. I was that guy who had never tried It and just assumed It was terrible. I was such a dummy, I let years go by of just hating on not only ghosts but pretty much the COD franchise. This game has changed my entire look/feeling on COD. Call Of Duty Ghosts Is now both my favorite game of all time, and favorite COD game.   Singleplayer +Incredible story (10/10) +Great vocie acting (Brandon Routh &amp; Stephen Lang were awesome) + Epic 'Uncharted Worthy' action sequences (Reminds me of Transformers when buildings and crap almost kill everyone) +Insanely cool setting and story. The Ghosts are bad***, and the levels are awesome (everything from scuba to space lol) +Great villian. I seriously wanted to punch that Idiot. +INSANE, INSANE CLIFFHANGER!!!  Singleplayer overall 10/10.   Multiplayer +Cool maps +Really sweet character and gun customization -Unfortunately, there aren't many players. (500 on average) -Campers ;/ (not too bad though)    Overall, fantastic game. 10/10. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's a great game, the campaign is fun and the multiplayer is super innovative, but the maps cause the game to be camp central. The game engine is butter smooth, it has great graphics, best hit detection of any Call of Duty. Only reason why not to get the game is because the multiplayer is dead. You can live with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maps since it's still COD as you know it. You can still get games, but they will be high ping, unless you are host."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well I liked it, multiplayer is decent too"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS GOOD BUT WHE NEED MORE PLAYERS!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First, I'd like to say, I loved the campaign, however, the last couple cut scenes litterally ruined the game for me, without those two I would have been happy. Now on to multiplayer, its a different take on a COD game multiplayer and I think it works. The comunity is considerably smaller than in MW2 but also I find it to be a lot more fair, and far less cheaters if any (at least from what I've played). The multi player could offer more of a benefit to newer players so they stand a bit more of a chance against the people who have everything since they've been playing since its release. Other than that I think it is an overall good game. Those last two cut scenes â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not bad, but simply not as good as Call of Duty II."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I masterbate to the females on this game daily
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This edition lacks the final touches that make others COD way better. I'm not very impressed with Ghosts. But still a good game to play around with friends.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too many cheaters which steam makes no effort to control.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love this game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Despite all of the hate, it is actually not that bad.  Be carefull though, If you do not have direct X 11 or Higher the game WILL crash on load and it will just be a digital paperweight.  Also I recommend buying it while it's on sale ( I only paid Â£10 instead of the Â£40 it normally costs) because even though its good, its nor worth all Â£40"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I started playing Counter Strike in 1998 or 99 can't remember... all the way to 2011. COD Ghosts was the only game to make me step away from Counter Strike. I purchased Battle Field 4 and didn't like it as much as COD Ghosts. I also just recently purchased COD Advance Warfare and I really tried to like it for months but all the jumping around made me rage and trust me I hardly ever rage. I just think COD Ghosts game play, especially in team death match is the best. If you get your perks &amp; assualt package setup just right to match your style of play, you will have great success in COD Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I farted pretty hard and then this game popped out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"what a complete load of crap, never ever buy it . it has no replayability. if battlefield 4 only had 20 seconds of gameplay it would still be ten times better......awful "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great campaign !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst cod game ever!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is kinda fun, get it on â™¥â™¥â™¥ for 10$ its pretty much worth that. aliens mode is alright"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,+ Nice graphics + New scorestreaks and features + Awesome campaign + Balanced weapons + Squad Points System - Campers - Bullets do more damage (kinda less health) - Needs a lot of space  Systematic better than Black ops 2.  8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Beat campaign in 5 hours flat.  Multiplayer not worth it and full of children (of age and not of age.)  Worth 10 bucks if you get it on sale, not worth more than that.  Story is cheese but the space combat and some ground set peices are amazing on max graphics.  You have to use nvidia driver 344.11 or else you'll get a ctd near end of game that IW will never patch and it's not looking like nvidia gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ either."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have changed my mind because, and I do not know why, while this game was buggy when I was using Windows 8.1, now that I am using Windows 10 it works flawlessly, and that was my only concern: that it hanged up so many times. Now it's just perfect. It is a pity we do not have 'Extinction 2' or something similar.  Below, my former review.  ---------------------------------  BUGGY AS HELL!  For me, this game shines in 'Extinction mode', which is kinda new concept, because some of us were already tired of zombies and horde mode. Extinction has an end which does not imply to die: you can escape! Up to 4 players against aliens, nice weapons and upgrades, the ark, the cryptid ammo, etc.  However, under Windows 8.1 around 33 % of the times you play the game will hang up and you will lose all the progress of the match you were playing, which means you lose the teeth you had earned during that match. If this happens near or even at the end of the session (after more or less 1 hour playing) and you were carrying some relics, you could easily lose more than 10 teeth, which makes you wanna go and burn the studio which developed this game with so many bugs.  And that is it, the bugs overwhelm every nice feature the game has. If I could, I would get a refund to punish these horrible and lazy developers. DO NOT BUY IT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not as good as MW2, but fun. Personally I feel it combines new elements (aliens, future tech) with an interesting story, with actual characters and not just a bland number of US-soldiers and great visuals.  The dog could have played a bigger role though...at least they went easy on the vehicle sections this time.  Multiplayer is the usual aquired taste of 'get insulted - shoot insulting 10-year-old-who-insist-on-being-much-older-than-you in the face - get insulted again - repeat'. It is fun for a while, but nothing revolutionary either. The player base once again is the true toxic core of any issues I have with the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Extinction was nice
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game. Ragequit simulator 2013 But it's fun for a guy with 2.7 K/D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Finished the game last night,and imma write a short review about it.  Now,i kinda get why people hate this game,i mean the ending is pure...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. i don't know what they thought of when they chose that cliffhanger but..man.. Anyway this game has some good stuff,and some bad ones.  I liked the singleplayer,some missions anyways,and never had any problems/bugs. I can't really complain about the graphics,i mean yeah it looks pretty bad,but not that bad.  Now the bad stuff,hmm.  Uhm,SuperRorke? What about that? Multiplayer - Servers &amp; hosts in this game are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,i can't really play. Some of the guns' sound are bad.  Im going to recommend this game just because it felt like something new for a while,or because im a fanboy. Noone will know. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"ANNOYING!!! i cant join ANYTHING, like, games, alien thingy, NYTHING. it just, freezes :'("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really liked this game! It's among the best singleplayer-experiences CoD has to offer. Haven't tested the multiplayer yet, so the bad reviews might come from that department."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DEAR IDIOTS WHO WORK AT INFINTY WARD YOU HAVE NEVER MAKE A GAME WITH SO MANY FPS DROPS AND SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH TEXTURE.....CRAP EFFORT INFINITY WARD. YOU ARE THE REASON I NOW OWN BATTLEFEILD. IF YOU OWN A HIGH END PC, DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME BUY A CONSOLE, PC GAMERS FOBBED OFF AGAIN WITH STUPID SPECS, 100% CPU USAGE 6GB RAM REQUIERMENT AND STILL WONT RUN SMOTH. AWFULL EFFORT"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â€œForwardâ€ - there may be no better way to sum up the essence of this 2014 adrenaline-driven military frag-fest Call of Duty: Ghosts. Every single moment Iâ€™ve spent playing the game so far, regardless of which mode, has encouraged, nay, begged me to keep the gas pedal on the floor and not look back. The only way â€œForwardâ€ doesnâ€™t apply, unfortunately, is to the overall innovation and evolution Ghosts brings to the series. It brings the same solid experience gamers are used to, but unfortunately cuts a few great things its predecessors have added to the mix while failing to replace the missing features with anything substantially meaningful. Call of Duty: Ghosts isnâ€™t by any means a bad game, it just isnâ€™t nearly as good as it should be.   While it used to be the focus, or at least a large part of the experience, the campaigns in the Call of Duty franchise have been pushed so far to the sideline in a majority of fansâ€™ eyes that a large portion of the community probably wouldnâ€™t bat an eye if they were removed completely. Perhaps Iâ€™m underestimating peopleâ€™s interests, or perhaps Iâ€™m just odd, but Iâ€™ve always had a blast playing through every campaign since Call of Duty 2. Sure they might be mindless and a little confusing at points, but sometimes I just want to sit back, shoot everything that moves, and feel like Iâ€™m in my very own action hero movie. While I still enjoyed playing through the campaign, I couldnâ€™t help but be underwhelmed with Ghostsâ€™ story. While itâ€™s just as loud, crazy, and busy as ever, it lacks the improvements and ingenuity that the previous Call of Duty games delivered.  Iâ€™m happy that with this outing developer Infinity Ward has moved on from its three title run with the Modern Warfare story. While the series-within-a-series started off with one of the most influential shooters of the last decade, by the third entry the campaignâ€™s story had become so over-the-top and convoluted that starting with a clean slate was definitely a smart decision. In its purest form Ghosts is about a world where South American forces expand their reach north and into the U.S.A. The baddies, and frontrunners for the coveted â€œmost generic bad guy nameâ€ award, are The Federation, and they decided they really needed to invade the land of opportunity because, you know, reasons and stuff. Luckily for us, brothers Logan and Hesh, their dad Elias, and their trusty canine companion Reilly join a few other combatants to take the fight to the Federation through land, air, sea, and space.   In an ideal world Infinity Ward would have learned from what has worked best and worst in the last few Call of Duty campaigns and used their fresh start to weave a narrative that, if not emotionally investing, could at least try enough new things to justify its annual release schedule. Unfortunately it does neither. If Iâ€™d played Ghostsâ€™ campaign a few years ago, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot. The problem is itâ€™s a regression from what weâ€™ve seen before. The campaign is incredibly linear, giving gamers, with very few exceptions, tools theyâ€™re used to using, and fails to create any characters that I care about seeing again.   Regardless of how much emphasis the marketing team put on the campaign with posters and trailers, multiplayer is still where most people are going to spend the vast majority of their time. Just like its single player, Call of Duty: Ghostsâ€™ multiplayer plays it very safe and delivers a tight, solid, and almost overwhelmingly familiar outing that is hurt by the feeling that it could and should have been so much more. The multiplayer suite is anchored on a largely expanded pool of customization options. The first thing youâ€™ll notice is that the choices are staggering. There are an absolutely ridiculous amount of choices to choose from to the point that I spend a good half hour just scrolling through everything trying to plan the best ways to synergize my options. The perks are what have received the biggest boost, now numbering at a whopping 35.   From a technical standpoint Call of Duty: Ghostsâ€™ multiplayer is still as silky smooth as itâ€™s ever been. It consistently held a high frame rate, the weapons are generally balanced very well, and only very rarely was there a disconnect from what I saw on my screen and what the kill-cam showed after my death. However, a game can be as technically solid as it wants, but if there arenâ€™t fun game modes and maps to play on, itâ€™s all for naught. Many of the locales are disappointingly uninspired in their visual design. The campaign has a lot of cool locales that would make for some great ways to mix up combat, but theyâ€™re ignored.   Rounding out the important areas of multiplayer are the available modes, which, you guessed it, tweak things just enough to be different from last year without doing anything really exciting. Returning favorites are back such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Search and Destroy, with Cranked and Search and Rescue being new modes with only minor twists. There are also a few co-op options for those that are interested, but Iâ€™m not going to spend a whole like of time talking about them as I just wasnâ€™t compelled to spend a lot of time with them. Extinction mode is Infinity Wardâ€™s answer to Treyarchâ€™s famous Zombies where the undead are replaced by aliens, but its relative repetitiveness and small scale seem like a bore compared to the monstrous behemoth that Zombies has become. Itâ€™s fun for a round or two if youâ€™re playing with friends, but with only one relatively uninspired map and â€œdestroy the pod they come fromâ€ the only real objective, I just donâ€™t see it holding a crowd for long.   If you play Call of Duty: Ghosts in a complete vacuum, without taking into account past titles in the franchise, expectations, or other games in the genre, itâ€™s a good game. For as many bad things as I said about it in the review, itâ€™s still got the solid underlying foundation that the franchise is built on, and Iâ€™m sure everyone can find a level of fun. The problem is that the game doesnâ€™t exist well in a vacuum. The issue is that while there are a few additions, Call of Duty: Ghosts actually takes steps backwards, nullifying advancements of its predecessors. Itâ€™s the gameâ€™s potential and the knowledge of what could have been that stings the most here. Overall 7/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campain isnt great but the multiplayer is fun as long as you don't mind mad underbalaceing also extiction is basciacly zombies but other things so in some ways it's good and some not as good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i love COD Ghosts. Buy it, its worth it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 would ghost again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its ok, playable but not for to long"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's COD.. But I got it for $10. It was worth that and not much more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,+ Fun Extincion + FANTASTIC weapons + Dynamic Multiplayer maps + Cool gamemodes in Multiplayer + Controller support + Squads mode (Practice with bots) + Cool Personalization packs + Much better anti-cheat system - Multiplayer has only 'GHOSTS' and 'FEDERATION' teams - No internet connection bars or ping system in the Multiplayer scoreboard - Weapon textures sometimes gets screwed up (Restart fixes it)  http://i.imgur.com/LmjAs9t.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/DD42VNm.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/atZxh35.jpg  -----------------------   MY RATING:     7.3   out of 10 -----------------------
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-Singleplayer Campaign Review- (Highly Recommend)  Loved it....Single Campaign is way better than Battlefield 3/4 Campaign....   Graphically stunning and hell a lot of missions on variety terrain Desert/Jungle/Snow/Urban/Underwater/Sea/Air/Space/High Speed Train/CQB.  Control the Odin /Choppers/A-10/Drones/Tanks...Total Wargasm...  Multiplayer might be suck hard but Hey Single Player of Ghost was on of the best along with Medal of Honor Tier 1 and Warfighter.     -MultiPlayer Review- (Don't recommend for multiplayer)  Funny now they have decided to show metascore which is 68 below 70 and terrible for AAA tittle like Call of Duty. Worst Call of Duty MP experience ever with crap maps and overall design,bad gfx, especially bad optimization,terrible network code (P2P) and lack of social aspects,competitive features and not stream friendly at all.  Infinity Ward should stop doing Call of Duty series for MP aspect and it should be left to Treyarch, since Treyarch's latest Call of Duty series are a lot better than IW in multiplayer.  It took almost a year for them to release 'FOV' option for PC , unbelievable!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 would ghost again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i love COD Ghosts. Buy it, its worth it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i know people say call of duty series are always same, but those creatures who say thinks like that, play fifa or wwe or some sh*t like that! i like it so much there is more things to do than in many games!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Sun was nigh, my eyes were affixed to the ideal of a low FOV FPS, I was thinking Call Of Duty. I looked across the board of vast selections of the game (The last Iâ€™ve played being Black Ops 2). I had Advanced Warfare, Ghosts and the brand spanking new of this year Black Ops 3. And behold there was a sale, past games being on sale which is highly uncommon for these games being the money vacuums for Activision I saw Ghosts, and it was 30$. I had to.  Honestly, at the beginning I thought it was going to be a â€œSTORIES BY THE CAMPFIREâ€ type thing and it changed in a heartbeat. BAM, the world has changed and blah blah go shoot people because we said so.  Call Of Duty/Call Of Duty Would quick scope.  They really like to put more and more explosions in the story campaign every year I assume BLOPS 3 being just one giant Explosion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty featuring Ghosts Dawg. GD goes by the name Riley and when you control him, which is pretty brief and limited to the beginning of the game, you can rip people's throats out! Ghosts also supports multiple game scenario's too. Play in space, underwater, in a tank, parachuting, zip lining, sniping missions, repelling down the side of sky scrappers and the lot. Lots of ways to break up the monotony. Oh, and not to mention getting eaten by a damn shark!  I found Black Ops 2 single player experience a better one overall, but if you like CoD you'll enjoy this well enough. Ghosts took me about 6 hours to complete. That's about the norm for CoD games. The main villain of this game was boring and nothing ever made you care about saving the day, but instead just saving some HDD space.  I did run into a few crashes during my playthrough. Most of which took place while in the jungle. Not sure if it was my rig not being all juiced up on steroids or the games crappy optimization for PC's. Cutscenes tend to skip in audio ALL the time. This was not due to my PC. I've seen many newer rigs having this issue as well. Then finally, the game crashed at the very end of the game after I beat it for no reason. Had to reboot so I could get the beat the game achievement. Silly.  Want more CoD action then here you go. More of the same as always though. Buy on discount of course. Stay Frosty."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS CANCER!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Interesting game. The campaign is ok. The multiplayer requires a lot of tweaking, mostly to do with the ghille suit, some hackers, and the bullet damage/health. Recommended as a mediocre FPS from an once genre-leading franchise. Also, COD:AW is coming very soon, so be ready to be amazed... or let down."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Ghosts i thourght was an amazing Call Of Duty with the Campain beeing set with the ODEN impact the game was brilliant set in a Distant Future from the massive collision.  the Campain with logan and his brother is an amazing story i brought this game originaly on Xbox and then after a year i brought it on PC to see the differnce in Platforms before i choose which one to stay on. and sell the other. Cod Ghosts made me deside to stay with PC And the Amazing Campain and multiplayer i would give a 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game for coop.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great storyline, beautiful graphics and hours of multiplayer gameplay! Love it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Both story mode and online are good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thumbs up because of the Dog, I wish they'd made the campaign 100% focused on Riley, the Ghosts are scrubs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if u want to kill your self from lag and brain deteration this game is for you
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Intro: I would say Ghost is the make it or break it point for all gamers to either upgrade their hardware or fall to the side. I have yet to see any problems with this game with my system. The only known issue, they should have a weapon leveling up system like Black ops 2.  I also believe the main focus of this game is not multiplayer, but Squads and the other team buliding modes.  Gameplay and Graphics:  The gameplay is quick smooth and real life like. -None of the hip firing stuff. -Snipers are rarely seen, but those damn shotgun and knifing noob are still present.  -Maps are similar to mw2 and mw3, but can be distroyed, but not like BF3 and BF4.  Graphics: The textures and Details are the same as BF3, but with a heavy shading.  Thank You, NGamer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First let's get to the good things... The graphics are really nice, I also like the content and the gameplay in Safeguard and Extinction modes. The campaign is also worth mentioning in my opinion and it plays really nice.  Now to the downsides of the game, the multiplayer is totall â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t but mainly due to the community and not due to the developers. There are still some hackers around and sure, the anti cheat could be better but a lot more annoying are the little kids that aren't even supposed to play the game but try to grow the online genitalia size by doing it anyway. Also the matchmaking and lack of dedicaded server are a drawback and the ton of micro DLC are making it a little awkward.  However, to conclude it, I totally recommend this game for it's Coop and Singleplayer modes, not for Multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good story best i ever seen but it crashes so much that i almost said no
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Try and Enjoy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"  CoD Ghosts is SO underrated... It's a very good game and I did a video based around that this game was just too hyped... It's not the best CoD in no way, but It was the first time in years Infinity Ward was innovative and they took a risk. Granted they actually bragged about fish A.I. and the Dog is a 5 killstreak but it should be a 25(over statement).  Game provided by Dhaple, thanks m9"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,NIce game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game! Just needs to be optimized better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I enjoy this game. It brings a new kind of flair and story to the Cod universe. Only play it however on a powerful PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, sadly not optimized well for PC but when run smoothly its nice. Negatives: Spawn system, tubers, IED. Other than that a great overall shooter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of duty ghosts was the last line in 'Normality' in the call of duty series. Because it's set in the not too distant future it still feels as if it's a continuation of the previous games. The perk system was exciting and the prestige system was different than the norm in Call of duty. In order to experience the full force of the game you really had to dive in and export hours and hours of your life (which I did) the multiplayer was fulfilling because there wasnâ€™t many players on PC and overcoming your online enemies was just a great feeling. A ghostlyâ€¦. 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is literally the best COD game ever I mean who wouldn't want a game where the graphics are 6 years behind it's predecessors? The tottally horrible console port makes the game even more challenging with un-optimized Graphics that are comparible to the Playstation 2 you heard me the latest gen THE PLAYSTATION 2!!! Crazy right? No? Well Its cool because even with a 600$ Rig you can play on Low at 20 Frames it's so amazing because it makes the game so challenging! (So bad it could be considered a piece of art 11/10 -PinguinoGamer)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excellent work and bravo to the numerous development teams of this game and its gracious and humble publisher Activision! This is a master piece with significant improvements over its predecessors in terms of game play, graphics, sound effects, and everything you can imagine which makes Call of Duty: Ghosts both an astoundingly innovative entry in the series and a true next-gen experience. This game should be archived as the sole representation of our entire existence and cast out into the cold reaches of space to show all life in the universe what mankind was created to make, which is a masterpiece thousands of years in the making combining all of our collective knowledge and resources to make this game. It is so great of an achievement of mankind that I call it a game only for the lack of a word that would properly describe this gift from god."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Piece... Of....Junk...sorry i cant call it a game...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Much shoterini , very tortelini , too nooberini."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, sadly not optimized well for PC but when run smoothly its nice. Negatives: Spawn system, tubers, IED. Other than that a great overall shooter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best potato server on the planet &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a good game!! I think you wrong about the bad comments!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its ok to me  Singleplayer:8.5/10 Mulytplayer:7/10 I can t understand all the negatives coments.If you love cod you will love this game :D Buy on instant gaming!much cheaper!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is Eick GAME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"very good, excellent graphics, terrific gameplay, definitely recommended. but heavy on 4k, i am using 2 gtx 970 in sli and had to turn off dynamic fur to get enough framerate."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The last good and close to reality CoD (no high-jump, wall sliding &amp; fake weapons).  We are waiting for Ghosts II.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game.Love the maps and weapons.You better have a good graphics card and updated PC to run this game without any problems.I would buy it again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"full of rubbish hackers, dont bother wasting money and hd space to download/buy this peice of crap"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game ever i would rather play E.T The Game then this horse crap -1/10 Dont Get It.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS SHI TTTTTTTTTTTT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game is actually not that bad, other than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maps and no players online"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Im going to get hate for this, But ive been playing CoD scince CoD 4, And to me this is one of the best CoDs yet, THe graphics are amazing and i found the multiplayer to be really fun, Idk why people hate on this game so much, Give it a chance, its pretty fun"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've bought this a week after release and I think it's time to take it to parts after half an year.   At first I was confused with such an unoptimized â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, cause it takes 4 CDs and over 50 Gb to launch. Next I totally launched it and got ready to some incredible movie I'd ever seen BUT as soon as I've started watch this cutscenes I have got a bad feeling that this scenario is going to hell completely. The plot have absolutely nothing for protract player. So many script wars about nothing is not the way that I can really take from CoD series and this crude storyline about Ghosts squad is not really cost the money that I've paid.   But despite that     Infinity Ward     gives me multiplayer that looks pretty awesome for CoD. Such many ways to customization your character make me feel better when I killstreaking some foolz in another lagging server. __________________________________  Gameplay â€” 5/10 Storyline â€” 3/10 Lookview â€” 6/10 Multiplayer â€” 8/10 Soundtrack â€” 8/10   Doosha   â€” 3/10      In total     â€” 6/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Met an immortal Had a lightshow with no strippers Hacked the system Had a tank fight And this game made me love dogs 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Black Ops 2 was Better but still a good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best Call of Duty game released in 2013.  Full video review:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Call of Duty: Ghosts PC Game Review&nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really cool and good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Eat a bag of donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. This game is pretty good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's the best game EVER made !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not impressed. I finished the single player, on normal, in 6 hours. If you haven't bought it yet, wait for a sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Eyyyy 10 part of the franchise came out, ALL JUST COOL"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Steam connect failed....realy...REALLY??!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you dont have this game yet...don't buy it. It's nothing new to the other CoDs, and is fun for the first few days but then returns to its usual style of play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Haven't played a COD this good since MW2.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really really bad, dont waste your money for this piece of crap. game is not fluent, spawn points are ridiculously close or far from the fight and servers are causing constant lags. Do not buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is just an amzing game, It's sad though that it has so bad graphics sometimes..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer sucks, but the epic campaign (almost) makes up for it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Recommended
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cool Arcade game, it's fun to play"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Balance Isnt Bad but Graphics seems to be Bad unless everything is set on Extra... Its Quite hard to See The Enemies... Also There arent many East Asian/ Asian Server Games.. So Im Usually Lagging Compared to Other Players and That is quite a bit Disadvantageous...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think that this game is fairly addictive to play in multiplayer. But there are more downsides to this game than upsides 1. Crap Graphics 2. Easily Hacked 3. Not enough Multiplayer maps 4. Random DLC's  Overall COD Ghosts sucks. The campaign would be so much better with a destructible environment. (Such as BF4)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Haven't played a COD this good since MW2.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really cool and good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call Of Duty : Ghosts, this game is mildly entertaining but in no means great or even that good. If you want a game that can hold your attention for short periods of time then this might be the game for you. The campaign has a weird storyline that I don't remember much of but the gameplay overall was not too bad.Extinction is pretty much zombies with an objective. Extinction feels kinda of rushed and I hope they do more with it in the future. And finally multiplayer, the multiplayer is very different than any other Call of Duty in the fact that you can chose different characters to play as and you get one class of weapons right off the bat. Instead of having one over all level they each have seperate levels and you have to level them up and get squad points to unlcok better weapons. Overall Call Of Duty: Ghosts COULD be worse but I find my self entertained by it for hours at a time so I for one enjoy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Black Ops 2 was Better but still a good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,shitest cod ever...id rather watch grass grow and stick my hand in a blender..now that would be better than this abortion of a game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is awesome, totally recommend "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,can be boring
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! THIS SHOULD NEVER HAD BEEN RELEASED IN THE STATE THAT IT IS.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game for me is great this is my first cod game. i mostly just play the campaign it never glitched but it did crash a few times because corrupted dx files but overall it works great in the lobby you must select a loadout or you will be a spectator until you do. the campaign of this game is very hard on ssd drives which is why the dx files were corrupting . but overall this game is comparable bf4 , but the action is faster pace in ghosts, but bf4 has better clarity on graphics most of the time"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not worth $60, but its good to past some time"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you dont have this game yet...don't buy it. It's nothing new to the other CoDs, and is fun for the first few days but then returns to its usual style of play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Eyyyy 10 part of the franchise came out, ALL JUST COOL"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,only good thing is the dog........
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best CoD I played so far :), comparable with MW2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's the best game EVER made !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not impressed. I finished the single player, on normal, in 6 hours. If you haven't bought it yet, wait for a sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I thought this game was a totally failure! A piece of crap, but when the 2nd update came the RAM blockage got removed. So I could play it, and I really enjoy it. I can only recommend this game to players that have a strong graphic card and a pretty good CPU. And ofcourse 6 GB of RAM or more!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its Good, but to much hackers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"great campain , but lacks a bit on the multiplayer !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it wont let me start the 4 level
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too mutch haker! lost 50$ so sad :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD Ghosts in the beginning was kinda a game between awsome and awful to be honest, but later when you pass the campaign and play some games of extincion it isnt all that bad even without dlc's, it's just the community that makes well made games look like pure crap.A 8.5/10 from me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is pretty good and the multiplayer is just as fun as it ever was (and I'm fine with that) and I haven't yet tried out Extinction from the time I posted this review)).   On my gaming laptop (Toshiba Qosmio X70 w/ 16 GB RAM), the game ran just fine and does look good as long as you know how to optimize the video settings for your PC. For example, my laptop has an NVidia GeForce 770M GPU, therefore I used GeForce Experience (AMD Gaming Evolved App for AMD GPUs) to optimize the settings for me, and the game ran perfectly smooth while still looking great!  In conclusion, if you are a fan of the Call of Duty series and/or if you just like to play the series' games for fun, the PC version is the most definitive version you can find."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,After Latest Update Game Run Well  Infinity Ward and Activision Should Make all Call of Duty Series Support 3G and 4G WiFi as Well because we are the Future and the Future Should be Advanced Support!  My PC Specs Core i7 960 Gefoce GTX 970 12GB Ram 1TB HDD Hard Disk Internet 4G LTE HUAWEI CAT4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but because its newer, not so much hackers around than in previous cod series. good fusion of both series: cod mw and blackops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its allright, i like the multiplayer alien invasion the best,  but people drop out to much when playing it, thats why i dont play it that much."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'No question, all hands down. This is truly the peak of their series, but who knows, eh? Many more to come.' - ZNexusPrime"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is great!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sick game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,iz muy bueno i shoot kill people they go to sleep i win i am best yes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Solo play is excellent. I thought all the Multiplayer maps were too short with not much time to hold a base or recover from losing a base. Having to buy add-on multiplayer maps, skins or other customizations is a turn off. I would buy extra maps if they included solo play as well."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Soooo over the top. They tried to change the campaign up so I do appreciate that but it just felt so generic.  Basically the story is: 'America â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Yeah!'. Short campaign as usual. Parts in game that did stand out for the other call of dutys were parts involving controlling the dog and swimming pass sharks in the wreckages. Campaign Overall Score: 6/10  Multiplayer was actually much better than campaign. They did not change things up much at all.  Extinction mode is very enjoyable. Most of my play time was consumed by squads survival and extinction mode. Great 4 player coop modes. Mutilplayer gets repetitive very quickly. Most of the maps are far too big. Multiplayer Overall Score: 7.3/10 (If you can pick the game up for under â‚¬20 you would be happy)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Steam connect failed....realy...REALLY??!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do recommend this game its really fun, and i like the game mode options and player option in this game ;) "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Eyyyy 10 part of the franchise came out, ALL JUST COOL"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,can be boring
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! THIS SHOULD NEVER HAD BEEN RELEASED IN THE STATE THAT IT IS.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is awesome, totally recommend "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,got much better graphics than the older versions of COD . the dog and wolf made it much cooler loads of modes both campaign and MP are perfectly enjoyable so many dlc's such as commentar voice change to snoop dog . I do recommend this game Cause its the most fun multiplayer fps in my oponion.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,game is good. lacking for any next gen game but nonetheless good fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,0/10 worst cod of all time
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"And I liked the game. The Single player Campaign was a good break from the old Modern Warfare and Black Ops cliches and thrilled me like a really good movie filled with lots of beautifully directed scenes. The Multiplayer is good old Call of Duty, but unlike, say, Black Ops 2, where everyone eventually figured out that SMGs are the way, CoD Ghosts brings balance in forcing players to be more versatile as all maps are quite different from each other - from small quarters to plain fields.  I see most people are very frustrated due to performance issue and sadly it clouds their judgement, which is typical for guys with low-end rigs - find faults with the game, why bother spending on a new GPU. But there's some truth to it - wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you have a good rig that meets the recommended reqs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this game, it is the worst CoD I own (don't have MW3).... Any chance of a refund as this makes BO look and play superb.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think after the update the game is fine but there're some cheaters in-game.... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,That 90 degree sniper shot seems extremely realistic
Call of Duty: Ghosts,VERY LAGGY BUT STILL HAD A BLAST SAW SOME OF MY PEEPS THERE TOO RAZ SHOWED ME THE ROPES....2KEWL!! JBLASTED EVERYTHING I SAW NOT TOO BAD FOR A TOTAL NOOOB LOVE'EM BOTH!! BOUGHT BOTH TODAY GLAD I DID 4 STARS!! BOOM!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Burn your computer before buying this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice lil laggy tho
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC version is trash but what sad is the wiiu version is better than this crap of a port. I recommend the console verison
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Played it mostly for the campaign, very classic but still entertaining."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is awsome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy it if you are COD fan
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too mutch haker! lost 50$ so sad :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fantastic single player, same old multiplayer. in my personal opinion the 9 hour campaign was overall worth the 60$. exctiontion mode is a creative competitor to something like zombies, but i still prefer zombies. the multiplayer currently has tons of performance issues, not much has improved since blops 2. but if you can get passed all that , pretty good game in my opnion"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is great but the single player is TOO SHORT it feels like it is shorter than deadpool i played the game and completed it after a total game time of 7 hours and deadpool 10 hours games that is this short makes me a bit sad because i want a really long game and many missions else i would give the game 9/10 for the story and i would love to play more of COD i hope they make COD ghosts 2 with much longer story like 10 times longer or somthing like that but it is a great game i do recommend this game and if you play multiplayer you may find a lot og hackers there is pretty much no game without hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome game:) Though repetive at times, it still uphold its Call Of Duty name"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ and whoever made this should kill them selves
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Simple review: Campaign was a little predictable but still quite good. Mulitplayer feels a bit too easy to die and you feel quite cheated when you die if you have low ping, But still very addictive"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is pretty awesome, to bad it crashes my computer every time i lauch it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it wont let me start the 4 level
Call of Duty: Ghosts,After Latest Update Game Run Well  Infinity Ward and Activision Should Make all Call of Duty Series Support 3G and 4G WiFi as Well because we are the Future and the Future Should be Advanced Support!  My PC Specs Core i7 960 Gefoce GTX 970 12GB Ram 1TB HDD Hard Disk Internet 4G LTE HUAWEI CAT4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The weponds are great the campain is good on line play sucks becouse of hackers and running crazy so this game is for kids and hackers. Activision does not care about us old guys anymore they wont let us have servers so for all us crouch and tac. players we will keep MW3 going long after this game is history! But keep in mind Activision we are the old guys that buy the games for our punk kids! = FF=5150

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its a good game, its just not meant to be played on PC. Get it on the xbox or play station. Also, you need a relaively good connection to play this game and your device has to be in your routers DMZ. but oher than that, it is an AMAZING game. Love it!! "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its Good, but to much hackers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"great campain , but lacks a bit on the multiplayer !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its very cool but its always hard becuse the player scope very quik and camp too much its very hard than BLACK OPS 2 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is pretty good and the multiplayer is just as fun as it ever was (and I'm fine with that) and I haven't yet tried out Extinction from the time I posted this review)).

In conclusion, if you are a fan of the Call of Duty series and/or if you just like to play the series' games for fun, the PC version is the most definitive version you can find."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute DISGRACE comparing it to MW2, 3 and BO2. It had driven me to tried BF4 and I appreciate the other FPS games. This game has trouble finding a game lobby nearly 80-90 percent of the time in Summer of 2014 while my NAT Type is still at Open status. The game lobby constantly has issues emergy lobbies together not sure if it's due to the DLC packs that seperated players or what not. Over all it deserved the general population FPS score of 68-75 AT BEST. I personally give it a D- for the lack of MW2 MW3 feel to the game as all my Airsuperiprity Killstreaks are nearly nonexistent in which extent if you count Helo Pilot, and Loki but that IS JUST PATHETIC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game will be AWESOME if all the bugs will be fixed including the worst spawn system ever. But for now this game is only good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just like every other Call of Duty game, stupid, mindless and completely unoriginal.  However it is simple, mindless fun in the form over of the top action and ludicrous story.  If you like every other CoD game, buy this.  If you have some spare money and just want to play a stupid game, then you can't go wrong with good old fashioned Cawadoody.  Be warned, the real meat of the game is in the multiplayer, I finished the singleplayer campaign in one 5 hour session. Which was kinda depressing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Probably the second worst CoD after MW3. Though it is kinda worth the money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"8/8 m8 gr8 love the uninstall feature, its the best part of the game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts," Pros    Graphics.   The new  hitmarker .   Bots and their strategies.   The new way of using emblems callsigns and backgrounds.   Squads.   The new  extinction  gamemode.   A new huge open air map,  Stonehaven .   A close range map,  Strikezone .   Private match. You start with all camo's except DLC's.   Cons    The multiplayer gameplay *1.   The framerate; It's not always 60.   The Dogs are OverPowered at close range *2.   The smoke grenades *3.   The controls of the helo-pilot.   Some of these weapons are unballanced *4.   Glitches *5.   This game crashes a lot by unknown things.    *1: Almost everyplayer is not even moving from their spawn positions. When you play the game for a while, you will see that EVEN (max) prestiged people will camp around every corner or inside every bush. Earning killstreaks is pretty easy if you are a good  rusher , or else the only thing you could do is camp until the round is over without getting any kills.  *2: It depends on your  skills .  *3: Read con #2.  *4: Same as *2.  *5: You should see these pictures:         bug&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Alas to start off with on launch day it was amazing. Fresh, fun, everyone back to lvl 0.   But once again CoD Falls at the first hurdle with no dedicated servers, the connection between PC gamers is ok at times but most of the time can be un-playable. I must admit I am very suprised that they are doing nothing to stop hacking. No updates to prevent injecting into the game, along side valve hackers are not being banned.   IW, Activision and Valve should be ashamed of themselves with the release of this, after months of playing so many bugs have not been fixed, hackers are more and more common, laggy hosts ruining the game. Please can a developer explain the following:   12 players  10 from the EU, 1 USA and 1 unknown  Host pick:  Scans EU and USA finds 2 machines of matching spec and speed (along side with same connection speed)  Dumps the host down to the USA giving 10 players TERRIBLE experiance. I have seen this happen time and time again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,keeps saying steam must be running on startup. the few times i managed to get it running it was great...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a aesthetic connisseur of finer gaming, this is nix admissible. The struggle of hour multitude. Impromtu gaming shall slit my throat, for logan did his enermy.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Personally CoD: Ghosts is a wonderful game, despite what everybody says. I may not have very many hours in single player as you can tell, but I have 430+ hours in multiplayer. This game was the first CoD I ever owned, and I was impressed. The graphics are honestly the best in a CoD game I have ever seen, and the maps are highly detailed. There is quite a nice variety of weapons, and I like the perk system for how unique it is. If you want a more battlefield-like experience with much bigger maps and high detail, this is the CoD for you. It is too bad that not that many people play it anymore, however."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you like a half done story that will take 2 more call of duty to finish then the main game may be for you! (you play the bad guy in the next part) It only gets better with the Multi-player! you can now have a team of bots play with you so you can remind yourself how much of a life you don't have! if that doesn't suit you then try playing with people that will yell at you for sucking and remind you why you play with bots in the first place. and if that still doesn't sell this game for you! Try the new and not rip of version of Left 4 Dead! it's where you fight a bunch of aliens and other crap that aren't zombies! you will never find people who wil stay long enough for you to win it anyway. ENJOY!! *Edit* I forgot to add that there is a dog and fish move when you get close to them. 21 out of 10 GOTY - Polygon
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not my Favourite game in the Series, It has some nice features which make the game unique different to the rest, but the only area this game falls is that the PC Version lacks the features at which the PS4 and Xbox One have, making the maps for PC feeling empty and just a waste.  Good game if your a strong Call of duty fan :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Actually better than i thought. :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campaign is pretty uninspired but if you are a True COD fan then just pick it up. Multiplayer is pretty dead at this point and nothing to scream about honestly. Advanced Warfare and Black Ops 3 way better.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign is good, rest okay'isch'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is fun to play rock on to the end!!!!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game would've been better if it actually worked on my PC. I loved it on Xbox even though everyone hates it. Extinction was by far my favorite part of the game - it was really well made and very addicting. I'm max prestige on Xbox for Extinction and have everything in the armory, lol."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Call of Duty gets a lot of hate from players but i'm one of those who really like this game. It brought new things that i really appreciated and liked, like creating your own soldier or new create a class system (especially the perk system is nice). I agree with all those who doesn't like CoD Ghosts only in one thing and it's that the health of player in this game was really low so it was like playing hardcore mode in every mode. The developers fixed it in update so it's not that bad anymore, but still i feel like that health should be just a little more higher like in previous CoDs. This is the only issue i found in this game, i really like CoD Ghosts, only thing it needs (except that higher health) is more players. Even if this game was the worst from classic style CoDs, it's still much better than all new CoDs with all those super-powers and flying. I can recommend this game without any doubt. Result: 9,5/10 (just for that low health and not enough players, othrwise it would be 10/10)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This was the last COD I'd like to play. I miss the COD1, 2 and MW style. I still liked a lot MW3, but those newer ones aren't the same anymore. These games are too quake style for me and to all my friends I played hundreds of hours still years after they where released. It's a pity, that the MW remastered don't comes out as stand alone, cuz I'll never buy IW, since I played with all those 'wallwalk' and 'jetpack' things... I really want back the old school style, where we scored what we scored, and there where not as much airstrike and heli things. It was a lot of fun to make the process to be skilled without any 'free' frags."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good COD buy it and lets play !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TRETARD GAME IDONT YUFKCUI TNGET IT!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Badly ported to PC, fun with friends, but still sorta meh   6/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"SINGLEPLAYER: This game is not good. But not bad either. Its just okay. This game has more PRO's than CON's. Nothing original. (SPOILER: When Riley's got hit... i actually felt bad...)  Thumbs up... Barely...  MULTIPLAYER: The worst i ever seen... No ping display? Why? i lagged, but i did not know my network suck, or the game suck. Then i figured it out: the game suck.  Nothing original, nothing new. the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-up shooter, as every year.   Final verdict: For single player: Buy it. The story its not interesting, but enough to Blow-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-up! For multiplayer: Never.  3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a nice game for the guys that like Call of Duty. There is previous stuff like Squad games that was also in Modern Warfare 3. Multiplayer is good without hackers for sure, but again it's a enjoyable game. This game needs tactics and teamwork. Also i was intrested for the Exctintion mode which is a kind of little bit like Zombies but Exctintion is different. Exctintion has aliens and you need to complete the mission by completing challenges, destroy the eggs, put the nuke and obviously kill the aliens. Call of Duty Ghosts has made an app which can be found from the Play Store or from Apple Store to see your clan stats or your stats. I like this game a lot so it's your choise if you gonna buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good story and very intresting mods and multiplayer!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well it's not very good but it saves his origins. soft gameplay with a good story (but not like MW series). i can say it is a normal game :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, i liked it, even when they used the same sound effect when throwing grenades of COD 4 the story were cool except for the end, the end sucks, anyway i don't care the negative reviews, you have been playing this game every year so... the developers are running out of ideas lol."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Action-packed and is a addictive game for fps gamers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game for idiots XD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"haters gunna hate, this was fifteen dollars u could of waited so u didn't have to spend ur money. The graphics are more than great. If its glitchey that means ur computer is glichy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's Call of Duty, ok. How fantastic can it be? I really just play multiplayer and I enjoy shooting people and kicking butt."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"9/10 would play again, could care less for the campaign love the multiplayer.  -IGN"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fully completed the game and it was good fun, great graphics, ok campaign, ok multiplayer. Extinction was also very very very ok."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really intresting campaign, i really hope it goes on. Saying that its a amazing first person shooter, Infinity Ward does a great job the campaign with a great story but theres a totally forgettable villain, but they recover on the multiplayer side with some very nice maps, great bots AI, the usual frenzied gameplay and the highly addicting Extinction mode. Overall, though, CoD Ghosts lacks the magnificence and innovation we would have expected from IW's new work after the Modern Warfare trilogy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Never play online so I won't comment on that but the single player campaign is great fun. Terrific visuals, if you have BF 4 or similar then you will like the graphcs in this. Audio/acting/explosions, all great quality. Not sure why people can this game, maybe the multiplayer isn't what they want or something. Picked this up cheap on a â™¥â™¥â™¥ sale and not disappointed.  I think people can't smell the wood for the trees nowadays. Grab it and have blast."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I expected a really good Call of Duty game since it was from the developers that brought us Modern Warfare 2 and the older series but this game has in everyone`s view has mixed thoughts about it, I agree that his game wasn`t really that good specialy the multiplayer.   Only thing I liked about this Call of Duty was the single player campaign, the story isn`t great but it`s alright. The quick button or move moments are really cool and just bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ I will admit. The villian honestly feels like an alternitive universe Makarov.   I had some fun playing this game, yes it has it`s flaws and the PC port isn`t the best as well.... Motion Blur being only turned on when you hold down the knife button and it turns off when you let go of the knife button, even though I have Motion Blur turned on in the settings, there are fixs to this game but I see the PC community dosn`t really give a rats â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game and I don`t blame them. As usual the graphics look mostly the same but on maxed out it looks quite good.  Conclusion, an alright game 6/10   Would of been a 7 if the PC port was actually good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Action-packed and is a addictive game for fps gamers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fully completed the game and it was good fun, great graphics, ok campaign, ok multiplayer. Extinction was also very very very ok."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Read and heard from people how crap Ghosts was but I wanted to try it anyway, I played it in one night start to finish; single player campaign. I found 4 of 18 laptops, shouted at the screen numerous times, (mainly during the underwater level) and ended it thoroughly impressed with how much fun I had.  It doesn't hold your hand like other C.O.D games I've played, no waypoint markers telling you where to go, I got lost in the jungle, lost in a field of grass, lost underwater, lost in space and lost on the deck of an aircraft carrier. Pretty good for me who could probably get lost in a one roomed house, I'm suprised I found my way to the game's end.  A big thing was made about the dog but it only appears in a couple of levels and one where it is just carried and whimpers a lot. There is also a bit of piloting an Apache Gunship, A tank and remote operated rocket platforms both in the air, on a ship and in space.  In all, it was a typical C.O.D game and all the negative reviews...you can go shove them where the sun doesn't shine...but if you can't find Wolverhampton then stick them up your backside. It was fun, it was a typical length and as I don't care about PvP then I recommend this solely on the campaign, somebody else can recommend the PvP because I won't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You should buy Battlefield4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"totally in love with the game havent been into multiplayer yet, but singleplayer the story line and the task you get to do F#$@ing nice"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I`ve never asked for this. -_-
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The development of this game started with a 'Wait, hold my beer'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game but got a little bit delay..i think no problem with my cpu because i can max all video setting.maybe Ghost server got problem especially for asian :( ggwp
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"By all means - not the best of those Call of Duties, especially with the Advanced Warfare recently launched on the market and Black Ops III heading our way. But, it is not as bad as it seems. Before buying this one I watched lots of reviewes saying that it's a piece of warm substance and yet - got a copy on sale. Won't pay 30 bucks for it - that's for sure but for 6 dollars - why not?   I liked the way they created levels - enjoyed the underwater missions a lot. They also reduced the number of intels - man, I hated those in Modern Warfare III (18 against 46). Plus, collected all and did not get my achievements, which is a bummer. But ye - the shooting part is no good nor is the story. Enemies do appear when you reach a certain part of the level and sometimes hit you even when you do not see them and they do not see you. Weapons feel plastic and the same. AK and a machine gun shoot the same, the only difference is the crappy sound. And the story. Two sons and a father and an evil guy you do not give a poop about.   It is Ok to play it if you want to shoot some bad guys and relax for 30 minutes but if there would be no Ghosts - Call of Duty franhise won't suffer from it. It is playable and sometimes enjoyable - lots of interesting moments that you won't find in other series of the franchise. Especially - the space mission. Maybe, not realistic but common it's in SPACE!   As a result - a so-so shooter with not that interesting story but with kind of amazing levels."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,gg would be cpt price again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok Honestly here is a review.  I played the campaign twice. It was good, It had diversity, and it was not really far in the future, which I like.   Since the next COD is 'Infinite Warfare' we will have no idea what happens to Logan Walker. No continued story. Huge cliffhanger.  I have 400 Hours on multiplayer (250 are on Extinction). It isn't that bad, but you have to get the hang of it before you actually start doing stuff.   Extinction. It is very fun. I like the fact I can complete the missions, and it is a seperate story. As with the campaign a cliffhanger happened. You launch into space and 'one day we will take Earth back'. Oh we will? Well, not anymore because of 'Infinite Warfare'  I recommend this game. I enjoyed it, and I Hope to see a second game for the Campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not so bad, but it's so good if you didn't care anything. Just shoot 'n kill!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Despite the mixed reviews about this game, i personaly find this to be my favorite Call of Duty, the multiplay is so fun i cant stop playing it, the campaign is beautifully written like a classic hollywood movie. i love this game despite its certain flaws,  i felt the campaign was kind of short, and it felt rather a bit uncomforting which i do not know why.  The ending was just spectacular, i loved it so much its somthing ive been waiting to see in gameplay,  i truely hope this has a sequel: (my speculation of the story going on) where you keep playing as Logan under Rorke's guidance as a bad guy facing a new team of ghosts as your brother seeks to find you and bring you back, and in the end its up to you whether you choose to come back or take Rorke's place. (as i believe you would become better than him and he would unfortunately die by Hesh's doing)  i rate this game a solid 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its a nice game, multiplayer is awesome and lots of different perks, attachments 4 weapons. Good game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is good i am loving it i enjoyed it , it have some bug and glitches but i can deal with that :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I thnik it is fantastic game :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awsome Game thats all that i can say, its just AWSOME"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the best game of my life ps I don't use IED
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am reviewing COD: Ghosts after playing COD: AW... to be honest, this game had a lot of bad reviews.. considering it claimed to be a 'next gen' game when released... I haven't played Multiplayer here but I played the Single player game.. I also played Battlefield 4 before having to play this game... This game is just the kind of fix I needed that does not require a lot of things to press at the same time.. a typical FPS game.... and it's fun! but not as fun as COD: AW!!! hahahahahah"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its not really that bad... Campaign was pretty good, but mp wasnt, even that i didnt play it much cause it really lagged...  The whole game was OK  Not worth 60 Bucks though, but it was good  7.5/10 Would Ghost Again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game. However there are many hackers.  Offline is superb but online is sometimes bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Looking for a shooter? You'd better look around somewhere else, because this game is quite awful."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not so bad, but it's so good if you didn't care anything. Just shoot 'n kill!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THE CAMPAIGN IN THIS GAME BUT I THINK THEY FELL DOWN ON THE MULTIPLAYER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I thnik it is fantastic game :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worth it! Even if its recycled â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t filled with more hackers than CS:GO for some reason...&lt;3 mindless violence
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game REQUIRES a Dedicated gameing pc in order to be playable. but you still can play it anyways. it looks great and its quite fun. the new monsters are actually quite fun to hunt down. fast paced too. to put the performnce into perspective, im useing a Win 7 64 Bit, I7 single core overclocked to 3.30GHz liquid/gas cooled, 8.00Gig of ram, Laptop on a 1366x768 Pix Screen, Intel HD graphics board with a NVIDA Geforce GT 525M card installed With the game set to low qualaty and it still struggles to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,".............I guess i liked it, it kinda had good gameplay, good maps it's a step up to the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ small ones in black ops II.it was sad how they did the small environment intereactions, such as the tree falling down in prison break, another is the gas station, and some wood logs, which is also in prison break. but all in all, I like it, and glad that I bought it for 15 dollars becuase of the holiday sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game. However there are many hackers.  Offline is superb but online is sometimes bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Camos, good looking guns (especially The Ripper). Fantastic ideas and great maps (for rushing) from Infinity Ward. I'm not jokking. I love it!!! :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Oh god...I thought a lot of bad things about this game...but when I played it I discovered that this game is actually just a new cod. Let's solve all partly.First of all, gameplay is a quite cood .  What about myself,I prefer more black ops than mw series. This game sometimes reminded me of black ops. To be honest, this game is not just a shooting gallery like other cod's, this game got a lot of its special moments. For example:missions under water, space, underground base and etc. The plot passed into the background, and it is sad, but after a credits I was surprised. I think that I enjoyed this game because I love the crazy storyline of blackops, this game sometimes reminds me of it. Second thing is that it was a surprise that this game was developed by infinity ward, not Treyarch. The only thing which reminded me that game was developed by them, was a graphics. And now, i'll say some bad sides of this game: 1. AlotaEXPLOSIONS (It seems that effects developer got some sort of fetish with explosions  that even Michael Bay looks pale in comparison.) actually, somebody will enjoy that. 2. Again Evil espaÃ±olas,brazilians and etc.(Everybody forgot about ruskies) 3. AlotaBugs 4. Fohked up dog AI 5. Spoiler -    Dead dad(I didn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about his death)     Summing up the result, I advise to buy this game to only who loves unusual cod, and don't go ape sh*t when seeing some bad graphics."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the best call of duty i played .bigger maps then mw3 ..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, its just a shame that no one from australia plays it. Its always a strugle to find a server and when you do the host often has bad internet."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its okay if you buy it on sale.   Everything you'd expect from a CoD game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THE CAMPAIGN IN THIS GAME BUT I THINK THEY FELL DOWN ON THE MULTIPLAYER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is the 10th installment in in the main Call of Duty series (excluding spin-offs). The game has recieved tons upon tons of critisism, and I understand where people are coming from. I personally got the game for $5 AU ($3.50 US) and, I played it and thought the campaign was alright. With some over-the-top action sequences even in outer-space or under water, it makes it a quite cinematic experience, however these levels only last a few minutes each. The rest of the game is decent, however, dull and repetitive. Most of the game is literally just a bland shooting-box with no character. For the price I payed however, it was alright. For new-comers to the series, I don't recommend starting on this game, as for most long-time Call of Duty fans (like myself), this was an easily forgetable game in general. For other long-time Call of Duty fans however, if you haven't played this game (most have, however), I do not recommend it. If you are just buying this game casually to play in your spare time, I say, if you buy it for as much as I did, GO FOR IT! It offers overall some pretty good gameplay, even while repetitive. The story of this game however, is so boring. While a couple of interesting plot-lines, most of it is just boring with a really dissapointing ending. If you're looking for some good Call of Duty Multiplayer, while still a pretty decent community playing, the multiplayer is horrible, not in terms of gameplay, but I'll explain why. The maps in this game, ARE WAY TOO BIG! You will get lost. Lost and stuck. Lost and stuck with hackers. It's dreadful. There is no sense of direction at all, whatsoever. Mulitiplayer however is fun, if you are just getting it to stuff around and be silly with it (eg, troll, smurf, etc. None of which I have interest in however). The game in a nutshell isn't horrible. For a spare time, fun. For a new-comer, ok. For a long-timer, disease. It really depends on what you're into and how long you've been playing for.  Graphics: 7/10 Audio: 8/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Campaign: 7/10 Multiplayer: 5/10 Gameplay Experience: 6/10 Overall: 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is good i am loving it i enjoyed it , it have some bug and glitches but i can deal with that :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All i can say that this game is not for every COD fan, there are some mistakes and error that made me have some rage moments. So if you like Squads, Extinction and a bit of multiplayer , then this game is for you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only get this game for cheap, I recommend looking for a boxed copy at walmart or target, I got my copey there for $8 CDN. Overall good game but not worth the steam price of $65 CDN."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"YOU SHOULD ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE STORY, ITS AWESOME.  SINLGEPLAYER REVIEW:  I personally think this game is awesome, a bit buggy from time to time (major fps drop when scoping with sniper rifles and dissapearing AI) but the story and the characters are awesome. Some of the concept for the missions are really cool too such as fighting in space with no gravity and underwater with reduced visibility and underwater guns.    MULTIPLAYER REVIEW:  *Joins a game thinking 'This can't be as bad as everybody says'*  *Gets killed 10 times by a guy sitting in a corner with his LMG just waiting for people to come his way*  *Gets killed over and over again by some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing auto C4 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just lying all over the maps*  *Realises how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the multiplayer part of the game actually is*  *uninstalls*"
Call of Duty: Ghosts, Good not Great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"  some may say this game sucks but honestly i love it, a friend gifted me it and its awesome, it has four ways of playing...  -Squads | Make a squad and fight others (Both bots and people are here) -Online Play | fight online against other ppl (just people NO BOTS) -Extinction | Co-op Gamemode where you fight aliens, similar to COD Zombies, better bring some m8s for this. . .  -And campaign, if you want achievements   but all in all i love this like most cod games, i enjoyed the MW series and this takes some things from that like Akimbo though i dont mind it, in some ways its like MW 2.0 or a spinoff from it and that is amazing, they also made it sorta harder to rank up and thats also a good thing but its not too hard also dont even get me started on dlc, there is sooooooooooo muchhh   anyway its some good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, only con is that the Multiplayer is 25.6gbs to install so be aware :p  Also thanks to T-boi for gifting me it :DDD  and one last thing, ignore my playtime here, most of it is in the multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no i will never recommend this game. this game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with tons of hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's alright
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The story is good and everything is nice. I loved the mission that was in space and the one in witch your under water.The gameplay was ncie and as a whole i would recommend the game to anyone who loves the COD series ,RPG and shooter games.  10/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's basically just like every Call of Duty game that's ever been made. If you like the CoD franchise you'll probably like this. There are a few issues though, it's not optimized extremely well for PC, but there are games out there suffering more. Some stuttering occurs even on high end rigs, but it's not unplayable in the slightest.   Do be warned though, there are not a lot of people playing this game on PC so be prepared to wait for matchmaking."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is not the greatest thing to ever come with the name Call of Duty atached, multyplayer, specially safeguard is a lot of fun though wile the coop ' Extinction' part is the best."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's alright
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Best money i've wasted! 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly, i had no problem with anything about this game...  Pros:  - Great Campaign - Multiplayer  Cons: - Performance issues  Seriously, I love this game! Ghosts 2 is going to be awesome!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good multiplayer experience where you can do clever combinations of perks &amp; guns.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I believe the call of duty series as run its course and COD ghosts is the main reason i decided that , it as a poor story line which is way too short and the muliplayer is no different to all the other call of duties. I personnaly enjoyed medal of honour more.  If you already own modern warfare dont bother buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts, Good not Great

Call of Duty: Ghosts," A relatively enjoyable campaign, plus a broken multiplayer mode.   Let me begin by saying that I seem to be in the minority with my opinion on Call of Duty: Ghosts, and while I do agree that the game has a number of certain flaws - which is even obvious by looking at the player numbers - it is not a bad game. Most importantly, it contains just about everything to make it an enjoyable experience.  I really liked the single-player campaign. Sure - the dialogues can seem as dull as they can get, which could possibly leave you with a clichÃ© Hollywood action movie taste in your mouth, but that is just Call of Duty for you. It is a ride filled with memorable moments and quick time events and if you let it get to you, you can really immerse yourself and enjoy everything that it has to offer. And of course, there is an awesome dog in it. I do not need to say anything else.  Since the campaign ends in a somewhat cliffhanger-ish way, I would even go as far as saying that I would welcome a sequel with open arms. That is most likely not going to happen, though, because this game was definitely not a commercial success since the multiplayer part did so many things wrong. The first thing I noticed was the overly chaotic squads system with many characters you can choose between, with each having their own ranks, unlocks, even loadouts, resulting in an unnecessary fustercluck of things.  That you can get used to, though, since you can simply choose to play with just one character, and the squads game modes are even fun in the end. But the like of the obviously bad netcode, random stuttering happening at times even on powerful builds, and massively increased bullet damage made the multiplayer next to dead before it was even fully born. I am not saying it cannot be fun, but it is definitely not suitable for prolonged playing. And it does not help that the menus have a DLC advertisement in every single corner.  Nowadays it would not be a Call of Duty without some kind of a survival game mode - Ghosts fills that spot with its Extinction game mode, which is all right. Something along the lines of 'Zombies mode meets aliens, Left 4 Dead and PAYDAY 2'. Once again, though, while it can be fun, there is almost no content unless you get the DLCs. The game is filled with it more than ever before. And that is simply not good. You get one damn map without paying for more... One.  To sum things up, Call of Duty: Ghosts is good, but could have been much, much better without the technical, design and microtransactions flaws. If you are a fan of the series, I would say get it for the campaign, but do not expect wonders unless you have a soft spot for dogs like I do."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There's an old saying in Tennessee â€” I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee â€” that says, fool me once, shame on â€” shame on you. Fool me â€” you can't get fooled again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game it selfs is nice, the ideas are good, but it made really bad. I enjoyed the game untill now but it hard to say it is an excellent game. It is a fine game, 6/10 ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why the hate on this game, I'm loving it so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really like ghosts personaly i think warfare is not as good as ghosts..!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is fun, Story is good, multiplayer is good. 7/10 Worth the buy on a sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i got it for 9$ on â™¥â™¥â™¥. thanks to that site i didnt have to pay â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of amount! gameplay is awesome! singleplayer story is awesome! multiplayer is okay-ish and lag-free servers (i didnt experience a single lag till now). extinction is somewhat like black ops zombies but instead of zombies there are aliens &gt;_&gt; i would say its a mix of black ops zombies and modern warfare 3 survival mode!! i wouldnt recommend this to everyone coz the multiplayer is dead as you'll find only 200 or 300 people in game! get black ops 2 instead! :D worth every penny!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Here are a few things about Ghost.  Pros-  - If you hold C while running you will do a slide  - Really cool missions  - Cool Weapons  - Campaign is pretty good    Cons-  - Graphics are a little blurry  - Built pretty bad for PC  - Story doesn't explain a few things, left a few things 'untied'  - Multiplayer is kind of dead   I recommend you get this for the campaign, not for Multiplayer. If you are a true CoD fan, you will love all of their games but like I listed above, there are just a few things that I didn't like about Ghost. But even after its faults, I still am glad I bought this and I will always enjoy playing it!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a nice gift to someone you hate alot.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wow, I can't beleive this game has negetive reviews.   I'm not a fan of the Call of Duty series. Not because they're bad games, but because they take the brightest of their staff, dedicate 100% of their efforts on multiplayer, and invite a homeless man off the streets to toss together a quick campaign for them(Not litterally, but you know what I mean). More and more games are following in their example and it's cancerous. It makes me fear for the future of games. Multiplayer is supposed to be an extra, a neat thing to do after you beat the campaign. The Modern Warfare series were the first ones to have a good, well written campaign that was capable of tugging at your heart strings.   Then comes Call of Duty: Ghosts. I bought it hoping for a decent campaign, and to be able to play with my friends who are all CoD nuts. Ghosts has the best campaign of any war game I've ever played. The Ghosts lore alone was enough to motivate me. I found myself wanting to do pushups while I watched the cutscenes, and I'm not the type to work out. As far as I recall, I've never bothered to buy a CoD game on both console and PC, but Ghosts is worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"wunderbar .I didn't buy any more cod because of all the reviews saying it was so horrible.But this was on sale cheap so got it.It's really great ,love the story,different locations and graphics are nice. I was mad because i thought it was to short , credits rolling..but wait it continues..oh crud it is over and a to be continued type ending.Yet there is no continued game ..wtf .It's still great and worth it but short and nasty ending.I had problems only when got on board the train .My mouse and movement was severely lagged .After several setting adjustments and restarts finally got it to work okay,not great..okay.Under 15 bucks..get it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good single player, good pacing and great set pieces that make it a great action game.  DonÂ´t buy it for the multiplayer thats not as good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing game! The campaign is just amazing! PLEASE MAKE GHOSTS 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Singleplayer: good story   Multyplayer: is good too
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont know why people dislike this so much :P I enjoy it to be honest. It'd be so much better though with dedicated servers, and if not so many players camp on tdm especially :P Perhaps everyone hated it because there were so many hackers after its release. I've only been playing it for a couple of months after buying a computer that can run it xD WIsh there were more Aussie players on it too."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ok this is your typical COD game but the story line is good. If you like a decent story line in campaing this game has it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Waste of money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Singleplayer: good story   Multyplayer: is good too
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hell yes this is awsome !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love the single player story line of the game, it has several scenes that have become almost iconic to the Call of Duty series, and the multi-player functionality is different but still similar to the previous games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ok when i try to laucnh the game it just say cod ghost is not responding! Its been like that for a day so im really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Someone pls fix it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game is bomb as a bomb
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I haven't had much online play time with this game   but what i can say for the story is that it plays like any other COD game simply yet exciting and fun  and the story reads like something of a Tom Clancy novel througly enjoyable and i look forward to jumping online to play with the other 12 year olds
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hell yeah 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bought new season pass but cant connect to anslaught 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TOO MUCH RACIST JINGOISM, NOT ENOUGH DOG!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,totLLY QOEDF MY MONEY
Call of Duty: Ghosts,one of the most dynamic and if not one of the best COD today ! whay the go !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Rip roaring fun, with benefits for multiple play styles. From running and gunning (or knifing) to ambush play - loadouts such as IED's and motion sensors give the advantage to the silent stalker, guard dogs to the sniper, and massive perk bonuses to the guy who wants to head into battle armed with just a combat knife. Whatever your play style, you'll have a fighting chance on most maps. Not to mention an intriguing and immersive single player campaign, some alien shoot 'em up, and an all new 'Squads' game option - Call of Duty Ghosts delivers value above and beyond the price tag."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game Is Very Good At Singleplayer !! Multiplayer Is Not Very Good But....I Kinda Fine !! :) 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,server are down and nobody can play this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is so awsome i love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bucking amazonian wall hackin aim bottin funnishness!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Definetly not a bad game as 80% of people say .  I actually like it, even more than Advanced Warfare. It could have been better if it was optimizated properly ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game with extinction mode its nicer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recomend the game just for the solo - co op extinction mode  Nice game, classic campaign &amp; multiplayer modes as a bonus. :) 8/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Although i never played the campaign, ive seen videos on it and it is awesome and the multiplayer is awesome love the way it is dynamic and and big and how open they are espically if you get a good class setup i love the Submachine Guns and Assult Rifles. Extinction is awesome love the way you need to fight to the end and always watch your team mates back. And love the way you are able to build certain traps and guns and the bosses are awesome. If you dont own thi game buy it right now and if you can get the dlc's not just for the maps and extiontion but for the guns and the awesome feild orders"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty good game, had a poor release due to hackers, better now."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i want my money back
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Only Multiplayer is good (Y)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I came into Ghosts expecting there to be massive changes between it and previous titles. In the end I was a little disappointed in how little the game changed.  Here are a couple of things that I liked: The scope rendering was beautiful. I found it much more appealing than the zoomed in scope. Controlling the vehicles and the satellite strikes was entertaining. Controlling Riley brought a new tactic to the game. What I didn't like so much: The storyline was a little bs'd... The whole 'Ghosts' origin and family story made it feel a little weird. Rorke making me shoot my father did bring me closer to the characters. There was not enough time allowing for the control of Riley. The graphics were decent, with some minor glitches here or there.  Overall I enjoyed the game and recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not many people play it anymore so it's kinda pointless to get Ghosts for PC. It doesn't have good graphics. It crashes a lot. I like that no weapons are totally underpowered. You can get a good score with no attachments with a ~NOT- BAD-ish weapon. But noobs can get an overpowered weapon in a day, and they can get good perks soon, too. I like it more if noobs have to grind with bad weapons. Killstreaks are stupid- GUARD DOG unstoppabe at close quarters, TRINITY ROCKET doesn't hit anybody if they are inside. IED are mines in this game and are so annoying- why does ACTIVISION put mines in the multi, it's so annoying. Too much campers and pre-aimers also, But private match is awesome. I just like messing around. Overall I like the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game mostly about stealt (which i really enjoy) prefer Treyarch COD games to Infinity Wards but this one pulled through
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign is great but mp is lame. Nothing to see something new. if you wanna play ghost mp dont do it, you can stay without trouble od cod 4 mp. I gonna click recommend just for SP."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I haven't had much online play time with this game   but what i can say for the story is that it plays like any other COD game simply yet exciting and fun  and the story reads like something of a Tom Clancy novel througly enjoyable and i look forward to jumping online to play with the other 12 year olds
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worth buying it, My favorite CoD"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Interesting story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I pre-ordered this and took 3 days to install this 60gb+ with my crappy internet. All because of Riley.   Thanks doge! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, but for 60$ ?? Buy it on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign and extinction are great.... Now the multi blows donkey balls.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seriously one of the best cod games. Hardcore af. Much love.  Peace!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not that good with servers, community and textures but you can still play matchmaking online so 7/10 for not being dead already."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A little strange StoryEnd...And yea the MultiPlayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up a little bit...But i bought this game with only 10 euros...i think it is really nice and Good...If you spend more than 20 euros on this game...Damn You are RICH! (not recommended for +20 euros price )
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I recommend this game for all those who love playing with hackers glitches and crashes which is always fun and frustrating that being said game play has improved some sence time of launch though it seems to be in the beta stages at its best and shows no Implementation of any vac punkbuster type of anti cheat measures inplace. One would think hard why after so many releases of different versions of the game they would be on top of this by now alas another failed attempt on the side note to the last statement activision should screen thier beta users better seems some of the hackers have been figureing out thier hacks from being enrolled in beta this would explain why on opening day hacks are live.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another COD full of hackers, if they had dedicated servers or a way to ban the cheating idiots then it would be GREAT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,We need more People to play extinct.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Still a black ops person.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good Game! need dedicated servers,and the PC games are getting to high.Not everyone owns or wants to play console games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alot better than the other games and really enjoyed it. does not have the same feel as the other cod games i feel worth buying imo :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Grate Game. Just alot of hackers and needs dedicated servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think the black ops 2 is better but Ghost its not bad :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like this gamed =)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While the ending of the Singleplayer story is a bit hokey and contrived, and thereseems to be more hackers than ever in multiplayer mode, it's still fun. The one real saving grace in multiplayer is Squads. Without Squads, I would say don't waste  your money on this game. Oh.. and get the Onslaught map pack. It's awesome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seems like a good COD to me. Only the scorestreaks are worthless AF
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BEST well to be honest theres no difriences from other Cod games &gt;.&gt;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awww no beter than MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Punk Buster DON'T work. To many cheats. Waist of money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wath is the devastation map pack an were i fond it please ?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The weakest so far, a very unrefined graphics engine compared to the previous games causing a lot more stress on the PC than necessary. OK story line though I did as always enjoy the campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's kind of like a Transformers movie. You want to hate Micheal Bay and his stupid saga of dumb movies, but the eye-catching explosions and Optimus Prime's badass voice keeps you staying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A little bit short, but action-packed, full of surprises, where every mission demands a wee different approach and offers new and interesting gear. Well, I played it through in one tense night and it was amazing! Once more - the downside is, that it's short, took me only 6 hours and I'm not the biggest master when it comes to shooters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is great game with many expansions and modes like Extinction. The campaign is abit of a let down though in the sense that the storyline is too short, completed the game in 4.5hours in the hardest difficulty. Overall its a great game story wise and unique in their expansion honestly not as bad as all the other rewiews out there."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TOO MUCH RACIST JINGOISM, NOT ENOUGH DOG!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hell yes this is awsome !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love the single player story line of the game, it has several scenes that have become almost iconic to the Call of Duty series, and the multi-player functionality is different but still similar to the previous games."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is my favourite fps and he have nicer end ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a great game but I hate how I cant connect to the Call of duty ghost servers .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when you fix the game ppl will buy it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ok when i try to laucnh the game it just say cod ghost is not responding! Its been like that for a day so im really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Someone pls fix it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"there is only one thing about this game that i dislike with a fiery passion, and thats the requirements for the game. i bought it and can't play it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphic: Fine Gameplay: The greatest! There is a lot of weapons and attachments. You can make your own soldier... If want a new weapon you can unlock with tokens. It's very easy take make tokens, just play! I like this game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"ya know, this game is kinda fun HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH sorry activision cant pay me enough money to say that  jk jk, sorry activision, infinity ward, raven games, neversoft games, and the thousand other companies that put blood sweat and tears in this game, let's get serious  ok gameplay. Gameplay is something call of duty never fails to deliver. I played through many classic campaign moments like the level where you control a really big gun, the level where you get to stealth kill enemies with your knife, the level where you sneak around and try not to get got, the slow mo breaching sequences, destroying an oil rig, and lastly an OP boss fight were at the last minute something rekts the bad guy and I get the chance to murder him. Ok so maybe those are used in other campaigns(not maybe...), but they were more interesting especially the time where you get to control a giant space cannon and destroy an entire army(Now that was fun). And you can even swim(though avoid the sharks...). And I even got to drive a tank(That could go over 60 because tanks can totally do that). It was very fun, the new knife animation actually made me feel pretty badass stabbing people in the face. Love the details put onto the guns to give them sheens, moving parts, nice animation for reloads. Graphics look good if your machine can handle it(DO NOT PLAY ON LOW-GRADE COMPUTERS, YOU WERE WARNED). Space combat was fun, Kinda defied all laws of physics, but was still fun. The dog was another memorable part, controlling the dog, telling him who's throat to rip out, then petting him on the head after(good times...). Overall I can say that gameplay was pretty fleshed out. The one true stealth level though, when it got dicey I gould literally get up and shoot anyone i saw because it was that easy. It needs to be more stealth orientated considering your GHOSTS! And the halo style 'hey look a completely new gun, sure I know how to use it' besides that though, no other major complaints.  Now the story. Not sure what to make of this story. A lot of ppl are going to hate me for this, but i like the story... until the major twist! You are yet again playing as a mute character(where did we see that again?) who is expected to do everything even though he is the youngest and most inexperienced person there. I do like the 'future' setting(not as much as advanced warfare, but that will be another review), it really allows them to do more creative stuff, while not being bound to modern day tech. The story has some pretty good 'feels' moment between you, your brother and your dad(who dies, but nobody cares). Atleast the ghosts you meet are pretty cool. The take charge second in command merrick, the badass sniper kerrigan, the Emo brother who becomes obsessed with killing rorke after he kills Elias, and your dad Elias. I can remember these characters, but not as much as 'RAMIREZ! RAMIREZ! RAMIREZ!' but they got different personalies that make somewhat more memorable. There is one thing that surprises me. RORKE! he is an ex-ghost who the enemy 'Mind-controlled' into killing ghosts. He was an ghost, but after Elias dropped him to save like 10000000 other people, the Enemy uses those resentful feelings and turns him against the ghosts. Atleast the enemies aren't russian, african. japanese etc.. this game. This time you are fighting: SOUTH AMERICANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yeah, the federation is a collection of south american states that you fight instead of the standard 'storm trooper' russians, africans, and japanese(though not much different'. So you and the ghosts, being the americans you are set out to kill Rorke and the federation. After the standard call of duty boss battle scenario. Rorke seems like he's dead, but when you and your brother half-dead are sitting there, having just climbed out of a sunken train after 'killing' Rorke, turns out he didn't die!!!!!!!!!! that's right, surived drowning, a 45 magnum shot to the stomach and multiple punchs to the face. He then drags you off to some random forest and your trapped. Let's recap, A major bullet wound to the stomach, being trapped underwater for more than 10 minutes, and possible concussion from a crashing train, pretty sure i could survive that too. Besides that, better than average story from the call of duty ppl, congratz, still relevant, but not good enough  Ah multiplayer, the best part of COD. Multiplayer seems different with a squads mode and extinction mode. but we'll get to those. Multiplayer the same, new maps, new guns, new lvl system. instead of lvling up to get guns, you just have to level up and get the sufficient amount of squad points to unlock them. yeah... pretty much. and you can 'recruit' new squad members so you can keep earning squad points instead of prestiging on one character. ALSO CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION!!!!!!! except. 99% of all the outfits, faces, banners, badges, etc... are all locked or DLC. But YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CHARACTER LOOK LIKE CAPTAIN FRICKIN PRICE!!!!!! the entire modern warfare cast, like Ghost(the original), Soap, Price, Makarov, even the ghosts from the campaign like Merrick and Keegan. and a completely enormous selection of suits helmets, faces for infinite combos, camos are still there, luckily gold isn't the most outrageous one you can get, but there are more. Most of the cool looking ones are DLC(duh). but the base game ones are very nice nonetheless, except it is funny to be on a team just full of captain prices(lololololol). oh yeah, you can play AS girls! Thats right GIRLS! never before seen COD mechanics right here(except no nudity PERVERTS!)  Ok on to squads. basically it's like pro-league Bot play... you level up your squad which can then be transferred over to multiplayer so you can give your character an edge before actually playing against real people. It's a fun gamemode for noobs, and ppl who wait 100000+ hours to find a full server(me...). It's a pretty new thing that makes it relatively easy to get squad points and levels before multiplayer.  Now extinction. all i can say... ALIENS!. yes frikin aliens in COD, not zombies, ALIENS! its very hard to do solo, like way harder than zombies. you have to move a super alien hive killing drill 9000 around destroying hives while being eaten by 200000 aliens. and it gets harder, a lot harder... as you keep moving there will be different alien types that each need different skills to kill and you have to spend time looking around for guns and attachments to use to your advantage. it also has a cool ability system where your character can spend money to deploy things like IMS's, ammo crates, machine guns etc.., all the watnot. This is one of the most unique features of ghosts and with the DLC has a pretty deep story(psh... who are we kidding the story is barely as good as the campaign, but i wont go indepth). The gameplay style is completely new to COD and with innovation like this COD might just have what it takes to become what it was during the glory days.  Spoiler alert....(should've said it at the beginning rite?)  so my verdict 7/10 would surive drowning, train crashes, and a bullet wound to the stomach again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I Dont know why Many people Hated Call of DutyÂ®: Ghost. I Liked it though. Though it isn't the Best Call of Duty game in the Call of Duty Series. But it isn't the Worst, at least for me.  â˜… Good Graphics â˜… â˜… Nice Gameplay â˜… â˜… Loved the Features of the Multiplayer â˜…  But I Suggest you Go for Call of DutyÂ®: Black Ops II rather than this one.  (7.5/10)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,can somone please help me everytime i open the game it says it stopped working imediatly please help me  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another COD full of hackers, if they had dedicated servers or a way to ban the cheating idiots then it would be GREAT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its A really fun game worth too buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Punk Buster DON'T work. To many cheats. Waist of money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Still a black ops person.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good Game! need dedicated servers,and the PC games are getting to high.Not everyone owns or wants to play console games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alot better than the other games and really enjoyed it. does not have the same feel as the other cod games i feel worth buying imo :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Grate Game. Just alot of hackers and needs dedicated servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"only extiction mode, multi player is full of hacks and PC update is always late, until now no davestation map !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is one of my favorite call of Duty games and I would highly reccomend it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Average. Recommend you get it at 50% off or more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"slow stat to the campaign was good flying in space but the 1st bit seemed boring but when i got into it it got more interesting and enjoyed it. almost hated the ending but what can you do about that? the ending did leave it at a cliff hanger and if they got back to it you know it could never meet the imagination of the game but out of context, the multiplayer can't remember, but i play games for the story, it didn't ruin it, i gave nothing away come on... you wanted to know anyway... :P ok well aliens to fight seams kl but didn't start playing it as much. started and well you can place turets like in servial and thats kl idk got loads of other games to play also so well idk if its worth the 30 quid but its still a good game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Right off the bat, I don't give a fat flying fruitcake about the MP of this game. Haven't since CoD4.   With that said, I was about to recommend this campaign mode - until the last 5 minutes, just before the closing credits.  For the most part, I liked the story bt felt link they missed the mark in the end. Some will like the different POVs of the assault, some won't. The dog, while cool, felt gimmicky and not something that one of the Ghosts couldn't handle. At least Riley (the dog) didn't die.   I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it yet after all this time but I will recommend that you get it from a Steam sale and not pay rack rate for this - unless you fanboi over CoD, are single and have a pin up of Captain Price, Soap, etc on your walls.  TL;DR: It's like most CoD storylines and will never get back to 'the way it was'. It's a decent campaign, nothing to write home about but not worth rack rate. Play is solid, it did *feel* longer than the 7 hours i took to finish the game and was engaging for the most part. A middle of the road rating of 6/10 mag clips."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its A really fun game worth too buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so much stuttering and frame drop. same thing every year. i cant believe i fell for the trap AGAIN.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Did you enjoy the modern warfare games and cried when you found out the third one would be the end? Fear not- they released a sequel under the subtitle 'ghost'. Just hope you don't mind the much sillier story and lack of memorable characters (.minus the dog who disappears at a point at the game and never shows up again.). It's a good game, just not worth $60."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game ;:)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awww no beter than MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Everybody say this is a bad game. I think it's a very funny game actually. Much more funnier then BF4 beacuse all of the bugs. The squad score is a bit silly but i like the weapons, singleplayer, weapons,sound and stuff. I need to buy more RAM to have highest graphic, thats the only problem. Otherwise very good game!! GG :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really don't understand why people rate this game badly. The multiplayer is great and the graphics are a huge improvement compared to Black Ops 2. I have a powerful computer and I can't play Black Ops 2 anymore after playing COD Ghosts.   Maybe people don't like it because you need a strong computer?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just completed the single player side of Ghosts.  After stateing I would NEVER buy another CoD pos, I skipped Black Ops 2. I refused to buy CoD: Ghosts, until it went on sale and a friend recomended it...   I played the multi player awile: same. Few changes, you still have the l33ts runnin around killing expertly. Then the hackerbabies cheating to kill everyone... along with the game.  You win killstreaks and slaughter the other team. And you get a dog after 5 kills.  The Extinction game is really fun co-op. You and up to 3 friends must fight through waves of creatures to a nuke you must set off then get to the choppa! It is a flurry of action! You upgrade one of your character 's loadouts- 4 available- weapon specialist- tank- engineer and medic. they all have specialties to upgrade in game to boost you and your team while fighting. You all unlock options to your loadout through ranking up... and they help alot!! You must place a drill machine on large plant like creatures that kills them in a few minutes time but other very mobile creatures try to stop it. You have to fight off these monsters. I don't think they are aliens but things from deep underground that the rods from the single player's space based weapons unearthed. Anyway its good shooty fun.  The single player returns to the epic stoytelling I missed in Black Ops- and didn't buy with Black Ops 2. You are one of two brothers that must fight to survive after the main bad guy attacks... everyone. The South American countries unite to wage all out war on the U.S.A.  Your father was in an elite unit called the Ghosts... how did I know that? And now they are tasked with stopping the evil doer's plans. The game travels from small town U.S.A. through jungles, cities and into space with every set stage expertly created. Infinity Ward does an great job making the stages 'feel' real. You must fight while fixed to a rope on the side of a skyscraper, under water in a sunken ship with sharks swimming around you, on the back of a semi raceing over frozen water, on the deck of a listing air craft carrier, in a space suit assulting an orbiting satilite and on the top of a fast moving mag train.   I am a huge fan of this series I realized after the credits rolled... Only if Infinity Ward is at the helm. I recommend this game for the single player and co-op.  The multi-player is fun too but it is the same hacker infested fragfest as ALL the others before it- just new maps.  -GrAnD"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ah, Ghosts. The troubled and much-maligned child of the Call of Duty franchise. In my opinion, this game received more hate than it deserved, but there can be no doubt there were some major problems. Some of them I list below:     It was developed for multiple console generations as well as PC - this made it quite poorly optimised and most people struggled to play smoothly at launch. Even today, it can still hitch at some points.     Footsteps were insanely loud in multiplayer - soundwhoring has never been so real and in a way, this encouraged camping and waiting to hear someone coming to you.     A very low time to kill also encouraged camping - he who shot first won, if the person had half-decent aim.     Dogs and IEDs ruined the multiplayer experience - so incredibly frustrating.  However, amongst all of this, there were some positives:     I personally liked the sniper mechanism - the so-called 'dual render' scope which blurred the background when scoped in     I thought the map design was pretty good for the most part - well interesting and different.     The perk selection system was good, with so many varieties.     Excellent hit detection - tanking wasn't an issue in this game.     Campaign was pretty good as well.  Don't bother buying this game for multiplayer now, as everyone has moved on. If you're looking for a solid campaign, and want to give the Extinction mode a shot, then this is worth a look. One word of advice though: make up your own mind about the game, and don't be guided by the community."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Amazing atmosphere, amazing story. Don't bother yourself with comments about multiplayer. After a couple of patches, game fixed and running good on multi also. Come on people, it is Call of Duty. Pure action and pure fun waiting for you. Excellent story coming to your pc with tough characters. Try to finish on veteran level and jump in squad and excition modes. Prove yourself in multi and reach to rank 60 smoothly. Just one negative thing I can say about this game, This all skins and dlc`s are not free. Anyway, if you like fps games, you should try this, if you don't like fps games, give a chance to this brilliant product."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recommended this game because the single player was good ,I know the stories like mw3 but this is more amazing and im unrecomended The multiplayer becuase the Port is bad and i got lag when playing the multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I thought it would be as awesome as Black Ops 2 or other CoDs i played... It sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hate this game if you're a real memer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seems like a good COD to me. Only the scorestreaks are worthless AF
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Average. Recommend you get it at 50% off or more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BEST well to be honest theres no difriences from other Cod games &gt;.&gt;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphics 9 out of 10 In-game sounds 8 out of 10 Gameplay 8 out of 10 Story 6 out of 10 Multiplayer 6 out of 10 Price-quality 7 out of 10  Summary-Producers of the modern warfare series are back,with a new special stealth unit called Ghosts.Campaign is very short,but the story is nice,tough it doesn't beat the modern warfare series.As a big Cod fan,i would say this game is at limit between positive and negative recomendation.According to the multiplayer function,this game is the least played from cod series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"slow stat to the campaign was good flying in space but the 1st bit seemed boring but when i got into it it got more interesting and enjoyed it. almost hated the ending but what can you do about that? the ending did leave it at a cliff hanger and if they got back to it you know it could never meet the imagination of the game but out of context, the multiplayer can't remember, but i play games for the story, it didn't ruin it, i gave nothing away come on... you wanted to know anyway... :P ok well aliens to fight seams kl but didn't start playing it as much. started and well you can place turets like in servial and thats kl idk got loads of other games to play also so well idk if its worth the 30 quid but its still a good game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Right off the bat, I don't give a fat flying fruitcake about the MP of this game. Haven't since CoD4.   With that said, I was about to recommend this campaign mode - until the last 5 minutes, just before the closing credits.  For the most part, I liked the story bt felt link they missed the mark in the end. Some will like the different POVs of the assault, some won't. The dog, while cool, felt gimmicky and not something that one of the Ghosts couldn't handle. At least Riley (the dog) didn't die.   I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it yet after all this time but I will recommend that you get it from a Steam sale and not pay rack rate for this - unless you fanboi over CoD, are single and have a pin up of Captain Price, Soap, etc on your walls.  TL;DR: It's like most CoD storylines and will never get back to 'the way it was'. It's a decent campaign, nothing to write home about but not worth rack rate. Play is solid, it did *feel* longer than the 7 hours i took to finish the game and was engaging for the most part. A middle of the road rating of 6/10 mag clips."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A little bit short, but action-packed, full of surprises, where every mission demands a wee different approach and offers new and interesting gear. Well, I played it through in one tense night and it was amazing! Once more - the downside is, that it's short, took me only 6 hours and I'm not the biggest master when it comes to shooters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very playable game now, they have worked out almost every problem with playability now love the new maps &amp; DLC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think the black ops 2 is better but Ghost its not bad :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so much stuttering and frame drop. same thing every year. i cant believe i fell for the trap AGAIN.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty: Ghosts was a let down but I have to admit the singleplayer campaign is and was good but multiplayer is a different story I CAN NEVER FIND ANY GAMES and when I do it's really really laggy and these kids rek me overall if this is just singleplayer 7/10 but VERY VERY BLAND but multiplayer 3/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Did you enjoy the modern warfare games and cried when you found out the third one would be the end? Fear not- they released a sequel under the subtitle 'ghost'. Just hope you don't mind the much sillier story and lack of memorable characters (.minus the dog who disappears at a point at the game and never shows up again.). It's a good game, just not worth $60."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game mostly about stealt (which i really enjoy) prefer Treyarch COD games to Infinity Wards but this one pulled through
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign is great but mp is lame. Nothing to see something new. if you wanna play ghost mp dont do it, you can stay without trouble od cod 4 mp. I gonna click recommend just for SP."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when you fix the game ppl will buy it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is my favourite fps and he have nicer end ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's really amazing!! :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the single player is pretty good but the multiplayer is just the same with a few changes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphic: Fine Gameplay: The greatest! There is a lot of weapons and attachments. You can make your own soldier... If want a new weapon you can unlock with tokens. It's very easy take make tokens, just play! I like this game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is so awsome i love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you can get over the horrible crippling agony that is the poorly coded new graphics engine, this game is actually fun and makes proper changes to the game that make it feel less like just another CoD reboot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"UPDATED 2-21-2015: People really need to stop saying that this game's multiplayer doesn't work or is dead. It works just fine, and is still populated. People still play it. You usually always get in a match, and won't have to wait long at all to get into one.  Don't listen to the lag and performance complaints, either. Just don't get this game if your PC is really old, or if you have less than a decent internet connection. Gameplay: It's COD, so you know what to expect. Is still fun, and still has a good variety of weapons and attachments for use.  Single player is of a good. The story is decent, campaign is of fair length, and design and concept of the levels is great. A lot of them are very exotic. This is mostly appearing so due to the game's war-ravaged setting, but levels like that of the one where you're preventing an attack on a space station are the most appealing.  Multiplayer is fun as always. Perks are still there. New customization options for characters and weapon/equipment loadouts are great.  Graphics: Quality character and weapon models. Character models look great. Are high-poly and high-res and look very realistic. Same for the weapons. They're, surely, what you'll mostly see in this game and are just lovely to look out. Animations, generally, are also well-done, despite there being some left-overs.  Lighting in levels is great. Coloration could be better, but it's not bad. Still some nice colors in the game's levels, but there is a medium-grade tint filter.  I think MW-MW2 had better colors as opposed to MW3 and this game. Even BO and BO2 are much more colorful.  Supports a good number of display resolutions, has a FOV slider(MP only. google for COD Ghosts FOV changer for SP).  Sound: Sound design is fairly-good. Voice acting performances in the game are great. Music is good. Sounds for weapons, I think, range from good to average. It's good that the guns in the game, at least, sound like guns, but a lot of them just sound weird. They'd be mediocre if they didn't actually sound like guns. Some are louder, compared to others, than they should be. 'Cause this game is a console port.  One audio slider, though. It seems like only newer games coming out are being so lazily designed as this. At least, you could turn down only the FX and music volumes down in older COD games, but all audio is now controlled by a single slider ?   Performance: Game has a good anount of graphics settings to change, if needed. Game is demanding, so you'll likely be changing up a lot of these. I know some people are crashing, stuttering, and getting menu lag.  You can fix the menu lag by disabling the steam in-game overlay for Ghosts and by going offline in your friends list. The crashing and stuttering can be reduced by updating your GPU to use beta drivers and by making sure your computer has certain, specific platform updates. (Windows 7) You'll mostly need the platform updates, especially KB2670838(yes, the evil update).  I, though, haven't experienced crashing at all in the game.  Not sure about the complaints for lag in multiplayer. Game seems fine on my end. Otherwise, system performance is about the same as it is in single player. Though, extinction seems to play the most smoothly. If you're lagging in a multiplayer match, just quit it and find another. Game hardly ever lags online for me.  The memory requirement has since been reduced for this game, but the game performs the best with 6-8 gigs. I have 8. Game seems to use 4-5 at times.  Controls: Are as good as they've always been.  Can turn off mouse accelleration, no problem.  Overall: Game is a system hog, obviously. You're not gonna be able to run it on max settings if you have less than 4GB's of ram and have a video card older than a GTX 560 TI and less than a quad-core CPU.  And the game is no longer 50 gigs in size. It's about 38-40. MP was 28 for me. Had to install 7 gigs after for SP."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is +a mad game but a lafggy game to play  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,server are down and nobody can play this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is complete garbage, I wanted a refund right after I bought, it, its pc so im out over 70 bucks for this piece of dog crap, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, black ops 2 is infinatly better, like how I worked that in INFINitLY, here is the shorft verson of why you should buy this horrible bame, Activisoin makes great COD games, Infinity ward makes crap. just dont every buy anything made bye them, they dont know what they are doing. BLack ops 2 - great game, different company. its really that simple, I wont go into why it sucks there are endless videos on you tube explaining why it sucks. there are too many reasons to mention. just save your money for a good game. This game is garbage."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, no more hackers. Playable. Wouldnt buy it not though, i'd wait for Titanfall."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its good yeah??
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game Is Very Good At Singleplayer !! Multiplayer Is Not Very Good But....I Kinda Fine !! :) 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome game, love it so much!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Multiplayer, although Extinction crashes and the campaign crashes after a certain point. Still fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Definetly not a bad game as 80% of people say .  I actually like it, even more than Advanced Warfare. It could have been better if it was optimizated properly ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"great game, good grafics and game plot"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes, I recommend this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Time to dodge some rocks but here it goes:  I like the campaign! It may be 'cliche,' but, hey, it's fun. The story takes a punch of current trends and throws them into one package so, hey, why not.  The multiplayer how ever is the same old grind fest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A solid, simple fps game marred by the console generation and rushed production. The game has great map design for the most part, and a michael bay movie single player story. This is the stupidist plot in the series yet, but most people don't play for single player alone.   The multiplayer is where the game shines, but falls short of excellence by using console monetasation stragities such as dlc maps, weapons, and cosmetic skins. Gunplay feels well and weapons are mostly balanced, while still being unique. The game was clearly rushed and isn't optimised for the pc yet. The biggest letdown is the lack of dedicated servers. With the current and flawed match making only 2 of the many game modes have enough players to start and even those are plagued with cheaters. Vac anti-cheat is a good addition, but it doesn't work fast enough or effective enough. Finding a game on off hours is nearly impossible. usually 1.5k to 6k players worldwide but the flawed match making struggles to find a game or enough players to start a new one.   This game does have the most robust experence with custom games such as modes and bots compared to the any other game in the series. This game could have been the best in the series, but suffers too much from a money hungry company.  Needs some serious attention in the quality assurance department.    Overall 8/10. Solid game whos innovation is quickly forgotten by rushed design and poor support to a terminal community."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seems like a good COD to me. Only the scorestreaks are worthless AF
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have never played a CoD game before and I love this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Average. Recommend you get it at 50% off or more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Everybody say this is a bad game. I think it's a very funny game actually. Much more funnier then BF4 beacuse all of the bugs. The squad score is a bit silly but i like the weapons, singleplayer, weapons,sound and stuff. I need to buy more RAM to have highest graphic, thats the only problem. Otherwise very good game!! GG :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While the ending of the Singleplayer story is a bit hokey and contrived, and thereseems to be more hackers than ever in multiplayer mode, it's still fun. The one real saving grace in multiplayer is Squads. Without Squads, I would say don't waste  your money on this game. Oh.. and get the Onslaught map pack. It's awesome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A little bit short, but action-packed, full of surprises, where every mission demands a wee different approach and offers new and interesting gear. Well, I played it through in one tense night and it was amazing! Once more - the downside is, that it's short, took me only 6 hours and I'm not the biggest master when it comes to shooters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a great game 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's not even THAT bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the worst cod ever but still a lot of fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, let me see. I pre-ordered this game before I read the RAM requirements. I had 4 gigs at the time. Not enough. Ok, I thought, I'll just get more RAM. Ordered 4 more gigs, went to install it and the new RAM sticks (with identical part #'s) blew out three of the four DIMM slots on my mobo. Now what? I paid $60 for the game, another $70 for the new RAM, which I had to RMA with a 15% restocking fee. I still wasn't able to play Ghosts, so: I bought a new PC. Guess what? Ghosts ran the first time without a single hiccup.   This configuration runs the game on ultra settings for me at a solid 60 FPS, GPU never goes above 62C at load, CPU has never gone above 42C at load (all air-cooled) :  Intel Core i5-4670 Haswell 3.4 GHz 84 Watt CPU BX80646I54670  PNY VCGGTX7702XPB GeForce GTX 770 2GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 SLI Support Video Card (with triple fan cooling)  Team Vulcan 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 2133 (PC3 17000) Desktop Memory Model TLD38G2133HC11ADC01  Thermaltake TR2 TR-500 500W ATX12V v2.3 SLI Ready CrossFire Ready Power Supply  ASUS B85-G LGA 1150 Intel B85 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard (Only stereo, will need to add a sound card to get my 5.1 speakers working with it.)**see update below  ZALMAN CNPS8000B 92mm FSB (Fluid Shield Bearing) CPU Cooler  x5 MASSCOOL FD12025S1L3/4 120mm Case Cooling Fans all around  Thermaltake Commander MS-I Epic Edition Black / Red SECC ATX Mid Tower Computer Case  Windows 8.1 Update 1 64-bit  Seagate Barracuda ST500DM002 500GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5' Internal Hard Drive  LG Internal Super Multi Drive 24X DVD+R 8X DVD+RW 8X DVD+R DL 24X DVD-R 6X DVD-RW 16X DVD-ROM 48X CD-R 24X CD-RW 48X CD-ROM SATA Model GH24NSB0  Seagate Expansion 3TB USB 3.0 3.5' Desktop External Hard Drive STBV3000100.  I got that for around $1200, all because I was out $80 on the game and the restock fee for the RAM.   So, no need to break the bank, and CoD Ghosts runs amazingly well and is graphically stunning. The whole 10 minutes of gameplay was so beautiful that I had to stop and write this. Am I glad to just run it? Damn' skippy, but what I've seen exceeded my expectations.  **Updated 5/18/2014** This motherboard does support 5.1 and 7.1 sound configurations. It helps when you read the manual, just plug the black plug into the blue input and the yellow plug into the pink one. Lime still goes to lime. Also I just got an XBox 360 controller for PC so now I'm playing on the 40 inch display using Big Picture with surround sound! Close to perfect."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a very fun game:)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First off I will start by saying I personally like Call Of Duty Ghosts,yeah sure it has a few hiccups mainly a slight stutter here and there during multiplayer mainly.Other than that I havent had any problems at all.It is actually one of the best looking call of duty games to date,the story may be far fetched but hey its a video game,just like when you watch a movie that is also far fetched it doesnt detract from being fun.In fact it makes it all the more enjoyable.The maps in multiplayer are also some of the best designed and looking maps in the cod franchise not to mention the season pass that includes some really inventive and creative maps like an overgrown jungle an old creepy swamp and an ancient egyptian dig site to name but a few among others not to mention guest appearances from two of hollywoods most iconic horror characters predator and michael myers.Become the hunter or the hunted as you take control of one of these two awsome characters in a new and exciting twist.also there is extincion which is a game in itself very well put togeather co-op where you and three other team mates fight to stay alive and complete objectives in some really graet scifi scenarios.I really dont get why alot of people hate on this game,maybe because it has high requirements but as I previously said it does look pretty awsome in the graphics department.Buy it play it enjoy it for what it is a fast paced over the top high action shooter. p.s get the dlc its some of the best dlc to date to be released for a cod game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Buy this game for the person you hate the most! :D Probably the only good thing of it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best game i ever played keep it on i think cod aw will be better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game love the campaign love the multiplayer AND I especially love extinction
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far has been a fantastic different version of the COD series, the silly spawns have kept me more on my feet and ready to die a bit more but still fun"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome Game, awesome graphics, but it could be better if it little needs of rendering, But awesome "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game thats worth playing :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game I dont doubt will be awesome on any console&lt; On my pc it seems bugged to hell. Numerous times it will just not load and I have redownloaded it countless time. Maybe certain games are just meant to stay on consoles these days. However the game is a typical call of duty experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another year, another CoD. I used to be a huge fan of the series, starting with CoD4. I would stay up all night playing games like MW2 and Black Ops on Xbox. I then switched to PC, and enjoyed MW3 and Black Ops II. Then, this came along. The trailers looked great! I mean you can finally drive helicopters in CoD! The weapons looked fun, and the game in general looked awesome, right? WRONG. Right from the start I could tell the game was made for consoles originally then adapted for PC. This resulted in the movement being sluggish and obnoxious. The community is just as bad as it's always been. The maps attempted to mimic Battlefield in the sense that they were much larger. However, Infinity Ward failed with the map design and they were either too large or way too tight; there was no in-between. The maps were also very colour-less, as in they were either brown or gray (or both). The only things I actually liked about this game were the graphics and the campaign (and maybe some of the weapons). The graphics were a visible improvement to Modern Warfare 3, even though the colors were just as bland. The campaign was the typical 'summer movie' storyline, but it was still enjoyable because of all the various settings and characters. Finally, the guns were fun to play around with, being different than CoD's typical selection. Overall, it was a decent game, but could have been way better. If you need me, you can find me on the Battlefield ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Diz games way different than the previous cod's, Go for it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its fun but its a short story
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You shoot these bad guys who want to kill you so it's like most CoD games except in this one they are not Russian.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty smooth once all the bugs and kinks was dealt with. Fighting Aliens was byfar the most entertaining part for me other than that you guys know how CoD is... Guns.. Nukes and dogs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't like that no one plays anything but deathmatch. Anyone can run and gun, wish they'd drop that so people would play something that requires at least a little thought. Too bad money talks so loudly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The big problem of this game are the haker....any 2/3 games u found 1 of they, and u stop to play multiplayer fast"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i have to be honest i liked the campaign but the multiplayer iis very hard for more probs cause i suck i now still and always think bo2 is way better the ghosts but i liked the storyline for some reason
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is perfectly good game for call of duty lovers .I play much this now. Awesome graphics . NIce maps .  Campaign is also good . i see that many gives negative review but i recommended this game . you need very high config pc  to play this game .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the single player is pretty good but the multiplayer is just the same with a few changes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,100/10 Best game ever. Graphics are great whilist uninstalling.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LIVE TO DIE AND I DIE TO LIVE........
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you like dogs then get this game. 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dogs are totally OP. Massive balance issues for firearms. Same vanilla multiplayer as every other CoD game. The single player game is loads of fun though. As with every other CoD game, I only recommend if you can get it on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i m sumon from Bangladesh. i have one complaien ,,Causei join the call of duty ghost Multiplayer,,,But Maximum server is now offline ,, So i don't play the game "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is patched up with only few bugs still left like random spawn places but no lagg compensation what is very important...and no idiotic jumpes from cod:advanced warfare :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is good but black ops 2 is better 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best game I have ever played.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game with extinction mode its nicer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recomend the game just for the solo - co op extinction mode  Nice game, classic campaign &amp; multiplayer modes as a bonus. :) 8/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I prefer Battlefield 4 for multiplayer, but i like extinction mode"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD Ghosts takes the story of Ghostbusters and mixes it with good old fashioned Merickan shootem-up and spread democracy hooyaah. You're strapped with those ghostbuster guns and the fallen soldiers have risen as ghosts which means you need to trap them and bring them to the ghost jail for them to stand ghost trial for their crimes. Remember above all, DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Although i never played the campaign, ive seen videos on it and it is awesome and the multiplayer is awesome love the way it is dynamic and and big and how open they are espically if you get a good class setup i love the Submachine Guns and Assult Rifles. Extinction is awesome love the way you need to fight to the end and always watch your team mates back. And love the way you are able to build certain traps and guns and the bosses are awesome. If you dont own thi game buy it right now and if you can get the dlc's not just for the maps and extiontion but for the guns and the awesome feild orders"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is good but black ops 2 is better 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is patched up with only few bugs still left like random spawn places but no lagg compensation what is very important...and no idiotic jumpes from cod:advanced warfare :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game only reason it got hate was popular youtubers said it was bad so all their fans said the same. its underated multiplayer was ok campagain was great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Interesting story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The CoD: Ghosts campaign in 1 word:  Doge.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD Ghosts takes the story of Ghostbusters and mixes it with good old fashioned Merickan shootem-up and spread democracy hooyaah. You're strapped with those ghostbuster guns and the fallen soldiers have risen as ghosts which means you need to trap them and bring them to the ghost jail for them to stand ghost trial for their crimes. Remember above all, DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I recommend this game for all those who love playing with hackers glitches and crashes which is always fun and frustrating that being said game play has improved some sence time of launch though it seems to be in the beta stages at its best and shows no Implementation of any vac punkbuster type of anti cheat measures inplace. One would think hard why after so many releases of different versions of the game they would be on top of this by now alas another failed attempt on the side note to the last statement activision should screen thier beta users better seems some of the hackers have been figureing out thier hacks from being enrolled in beta this would explain why on opening day hacks are live.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If hacking wasnt such a major part of this game then it would get 100% from me. The campaigns are good, not too long. The multiplayer and servers are fantatstic. Just the hacking..:/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Still a highly addictive game, specially the multiplayer very intense gameplay"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Decent game, I like the concept of a dog, and this new campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, i only got 4gb of ram and it still runs amazing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS COD THATS IT ITS A MEH BUT IF U HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH SURE BUT IF YOUR ON YOUR OWN U JUST SEEM SAD AND PATHETIC
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is cool but sometimes makes me angry
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun game! Lots of cheats/hacks, but that's just like any CoD game (or really any online game) out there. For the most part, I ignore them or switch to a different server. I've got 12 days on it and am max prestiged, and it's still enjoyable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just got finished playing the campain, AWESOME. All you WHINERS-its a SIMULATION GAME---QUITE YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING.......JOIN the MARINES if you want something REAL--GET YOU SOME!!!!!!!!! Great story line,yes there are some glitches--wouldn't have paid $60.00 bucks for it--free weekend and half off after playing 2-3 multiplayer rounds-----SOLD. Opening intros, not able to skip--fix it--give me the power/choice---jackass GOVT isn,t giving me any. Everybody will have to BUY OBUMMA-DUMMA CARE 2018. Steam play sucks--need individual servers to load on. If I want to play with BOTS , I'd like to do it without being connected to the internet-fix it dumb asses. Don't want to connect for EVERYTHING geezzzzzzzzzzzzz. Steam OK for multiplayer, but for BOTS---come on guys you are 1000 times smarter than that---Getting funds from STEAM HUH???????????????............still stuck on the â™¥â™¥â™¥. AWESOME game though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts Ã© o meu primeiro jogo da sÃ©rie Call of Duty.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game gave me cancer ... And I f*ckin' love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Garbage Dog Bad Poor Quality Fish Ai
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game overall but just needs more players.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"cod horror edition (because it sucks, there are no ghosts in this game )"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i legitimately liked this game nuts to the haters
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i paid lots of money for this. so i like it (forcibly) :))
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the best kickass Games Ever, It gets Really boring after a couple of hours!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Def a hackers game. If they would have put half the time and money that they did on the game videos and used it to keep hackers out of the game would be great.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a very nice game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When i got this game for chrismast 2013, i was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing clueless as to what the hell it was, i tried putting it into my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and sadly, it did not vibrate. then i put it in my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc that was just able to play minecraft. When i started the game after downloading it and adding it to my steam library, i saw a small window pop up 'Cod of Duty' written with FULL HD OVER 8K RESULUTION HYPER REALISTIC PEANUT PUTTER! I do not like peanut butter, so i puked, but it didn't stop there. when i got to the main menu i was shocked to see the most cliche backround of any shooter ever, i puked once again. After 16 solid minutes of puking i finaly lost all that weight i've been gaining. I smiled and said. 'Hey, thanks dude!' So i would recommend this to any mid-life crisis fat dude still living with his mom. 10/10 best fitness program."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nothing being done about the Hackers. I know that there is sometihng that could be done to prevent these people from ruining the game.  My review a really good game if the hackers were not there.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is not a bad game despise what people say ... theres still few issues but the core game its self is decent i enjoy the game and cant wait for the future patches and updates. the only way is up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,you need to fix the fps problems and optimize it to pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Todays technology and COD still cant get more the 9 vs 9? What ever happen to the good ole days when we had 64 man servers, Battlefield still has 64 man servers, step it up Activision you are slacking bad!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,9/10  Call of Duty: Ghosts single-player campaign is quite amazing... very interesting story and familiar COD gameplay; so much death and destruction i'm spinnin  -1 for not getting good reviews
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and I love this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and I love this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this, especially extinction mode! Love the campaign too!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"game is ok (campagne), multi is not ok, too much for campings "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A good game but with too many unsolved bugs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its like any other game you'll get people who like it and other that wont, just remember its a game and have fun and play the way u like to play if your a run and gun cool or a camper just have fun"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is near dead, but it has private match with bots so it's enjoyable. The optimization seems to be lightyears better than it was at launch and the game is running butter smooth on my current system. The campaign is good fun, I haven't enjoyed a cod campaign this much since COD 4 and MW2. (Mw2 was pretty mediocre campaign-wise though.) SPECS: Intel I7 3770 3.4ghz Gtx 780 EVGA SC edition 3GB 16GB DDR3 Ram 2 TB harddrive "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not as fluid as MW3, can be laggy, still too many wallers and speed hacks. reporting can be unreliable. This game will tax your pc to the linit. Check the recomended specs and update all your drivers. It is fun WHEN it works but so many players just like to complain about lag and campers, GET OVER IT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"okay i thought this would be good because i like infinity ward and they have developed really good games like the modern warfare series.but ghosts went downhill which sucks, i do like it but its unoptimized for pc and isn't worth getting for $50+. Infinity ward did good with the mw series but why did they fail ghosts? the campaign is just like every other cod but with masks and a doggy still feels like mw2 mw3 combined together. the multiplayer really makes you rage so hard... you can buy this game if you want to rage. you have to be in the right mood to actually play the multiplayer in cod ghosts if your not then you'd end up raging half of the time. worth $89 ???    HELL NO . buy it online or somewere cheaper if you really want it. 4.2 /10  even call of duty black ops 2 was better, you should get that instead . seriously."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best call of duty ever forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love this game :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the most underrated CoD. Best one since MW2, possibly MW3. More people need to play this, long enough to rank up one soldier and mess with the classes enough to see how good it is."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good graphics. Il ike the gameplay, although if you have bad Wifi, this game will not be fun for you. The Campaign is very fun and interesting. I would rate this 4 out of 5 stars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well typical COD where you run,shoot,kill bad guys.But I can say,that I really liked the story.18 missions,I dont remember any COD before to had so much missions for SP campaign.In my opinion this game is great,completed it on Veteran,collected all achievements,and i really can say that this game is worth attention.I dont get it why people say its so bad?Ofc AL sometimes is depressing,cause they are bad,but this game doesnt have much glitches and other bad stuff in it. On my personal opinion this is strong game,really enjoyed this game! Rating: 9/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is actually very good,but as usual,you will notice a lot of kiddies playing the game and not understanding the basic of first player shooters,therefore continuosly trolling about hackers,but hey,that is part of CoD. Some interesting new weapons and killstreaks, new prestige mode makes it interesting. Lag?never noticed."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a surprisingly good game. TLDR: The focus on co op is amaizing, still a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ console port good for less than 10 euro price.  Backstory. I am one of those people that never jump on the hype train for any game. I am more of a CoD hater so liking this game is as strange for me as it is for you. What I do for this game is allway buy the previous. So now that Advanced warfare is out I dug up and foud a copy of CoD Ghosts for 8 euro which is a fair price for a console port so I bought it.  First impression - not that many cheaters. The last CoD I played was MW3 (I have BO2 but have about 3 - 4 hours in it) and it was a cheat fest - lobbies with flying people, spawning in the middle of the game instantly dieing, people with endless granade lunchers and so on. There are cheaters in Ghosts quite often but you can definetly feel the difference and you can play the Multiplayer allmost felling secure that the people in the lobby depend on skill only.  After getting to lvl 60 (max lvl) I am starting to really like this game. The co op - Squads part is amaizing. You have your squad that you customise the name, the look and everything also you can jump and play as any of the soldiers and level it up. When you set up your squad you select the map and the mod that will be played if someone attacs your squad while you are offline. When you do that you can start playing against other peoples squads on their therms, you can play 1v1 pvp you and your squad against another player and his squad, you can play a 'Wargame' that is random mod and random map against bots or you can survive against waves of enemies.  The levels are interactive and fun every level has its unique event that usually changes the map a bit and its unique mission event. The mission event usually acts like the old MOAB but it is not achieved only by getting kills without dieing. Some times when you or someone from your team dies they drop a briefcase that contains a mission that you have to complete on pick up before you die or you lose it. The mission is usually something as simple as Kill an enemy while jumping, or Humiliate the next person you kill. If you complete the mission you get a care pacage that may contain the mission event. My personal favorite mission event is on the map FOG where you get the mask and the axe from the movie HALOWEEN and you start running and chopping people's heads while a creepy music playis.  Summary: I was more of a CoD hater after they screwd us with MW3 and so on. But For less than 10 euro Ghosts is a pretty good game. And a must if you like co op like me. The cheater problem is somewhat handeled and with a hand on my heard I can state that about 70% the lobbies I have played didn't have cheaters but when you get a cheater you can just quit and go play against squads.  Rating: 7/10 The reason for that high rating from me is that all the cons from the game can be overcome by the excelent co op and squads mod. You can enjoy your game without having to worry about cheaters or people to play with."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it could be even better if the game was more optimized on PC but in general it has a nice story mode and also the MP has a lot of optional ways to play and the greatest part is the extintion its much more better than zombies no different between exo zombies in aw or bo2 ! the extintion is more fun to play at all
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good story game and nice multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts," Am I the only one who likes Ghosts?   Sure it has some problems like Optimisation issues that even Advanced Warfare runs a lot better than this, the game looks good at some times and horrible at other times. It has a Great Single Player Campaign with best suited Background Score by David Buckley and a Badass Antagonist, Rorke. The Coop mode : Extinction is also a great addition, a Refreshing experience from Black Ops Zombies. Multiplayer is Okayish.   It doesnt deserve that much hate, Just because its a new COD people automatically make it look bad without even trying it. Stop spreading false propaganda.  7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Finally, a Call of Duty that ties in with the old CoD 4 Modern Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is glitchy and also infeted with PC hackers, but it can stil be fun sort of 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hackres hackers hackers no anti cheat they are having a field day
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is best gungame ever, thats what i think. :) I dont have lag on this game, and thats weird becouse my friends say that this game lags 24/7 but nvm :D   I love this game, good multiplayer gungames and stuff. And textures.........................  So so so so GOOD textures. Looks like in real world. :) Singleplayer is good but multiplayer is even better :_) So I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH  lyl ^^ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"yes, i recommend the game. but only to those who are past fans of the call of duty series, as well as those interested in modern war shooters.  as of right now, the game's pretty poorly optimized; it used to lag in the early days because i turned my graphics to low. seems odd, doesn't it? i turned my graphics to max and now i hit 120 fps everywhere. i think that's pretty weird.  do NOT buy this if your rig isn't really great, you will have serious issues running the game! you know what you're expecting when you buy the game: another COD. granted, it feels and plays a lot better than the previous (â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) modern warfare games, so that's a plus, but there's a couple of different things people may not like about the multiplayer in comparison to Modern Warfare 1.  the extinction mode is gold. it may be a cheap cash-in for Treyarch's Zombies gamemode, but holy hell it is still pretty fun. just double check on your rig before buying this. there's a couple things you need to do to make it run well (change r_elevatedpriority to 0 in your config to make it run like a beauty, considering the game forces it to run at Above Normal when this is set to 1, which causes major issues.)  the gameplay has changed a relatively large bit since the last two modern warfare games. a whole â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of new guns too, with different stats and all that jazz which is neat, no re-used weapons this time around. it really plays a lot differently from the old games. i recommend playing a free weekend before you even consider buying the game, though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i have this on ps4 how i can trade it for something else :( LOL
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love playing Call of Booty Ghost. It's by far the best game ever, and it has next gen booty graphics.  Must Buy!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The most smooth game i have ever played. Not very good graphics Not very good steam support. Very expensive with the DLC's and other skins.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, Graphic is nice and gameplay is awesome. recommended"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IM not going to buy the map pack to many hackers in this game.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good focus taken especially to the campaign. Campaign is flawless.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game!!! I realy like the campaign. I think it's great, the characters are well designed, the missions are very specific. I have some problems with two achievements, but that doesn't stand in my way. I didn't get to try the multiplayer or extinction yet, but I think they'll be great."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is a lot of fun!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good story game and nice multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've got Intel dual core I5 and a gtx 680 and i still lag on 'low' 10/10 its cod but bad

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is awesome but multiplayer is full of hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Extremly fun game to play. The singleplayer was a real surprise for me. The story was nice and the missions were varied and colorful. Sadly the characters aren't that good,there aren't such iconinc guys like Ghost,Gaz or Price. You can't really feel the brotherhood between the members of the Ghosts unit but it's acceptable. It was nice though that the enemy is finally not Russia. The missions playing in space are incredible and very beutiful. Oh the dog...the center of online haters...well he wasn't that important at all but he was a useful teammate. So overall the SP is typical CoD level,short but epic. Here comes the multiplayer. Due to the new perk system and customization you can make a soldier that completely represents your playstyle. The sliding and leaning are really nice,refreshing addon of the game. The field orders are nice in-game 'challenges' which can be really rewarding sometimes. The dynamic map change is also a fun extra,similar to Battlefield 4's levolution,sometimes it can completely change the way to play on a map. Kill streaks are okay,there are a plenty of them but there are some useless ones too and the Guard Dog behaves really unrealistic and it's kinda OP. There are a bit few weapons and some iconic ones are missing (G-36,Scar,Glock etc.) but you still can find the one that suits the best for you. There are some maps and sadly I don't own the DLCs but they are still enough and the map design is great. And I say it again the character customization is epic. Not the weapons but the looks can be chaged. It's a really great thing to 'Play' with especially if you like this funciton as much as I do. Extinction is a great co-op mode too. The 1st map is nice and well there isn't any story it's still great and fun to play,I like it better than zombies and I'd like to continue the saga but as I said I don't have the DLCs. I think the developers made a nice job they put a lot of nice and fun content in their game. I recommend it to everone who loves quick,intense CQB actions."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Since Fov, its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game alot actually stop hating , Its sorta still being worked on and bettered. I love it and probaly alot do ... :) Definetly a 8/10 for me"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Exctinction=AWESOME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its nice , but no dedicated servers !!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy until it gets fixed- which will take a longtime - not worth money right now, not optmised and missing key features, back to BO2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Amazing visual's on ultra settings.  CUTE DOGE, Story mode was ok, Extinction is amazing, Multiplayer has things that needs to be fixed and some maps are too big but its good old boots on the ground arcade shooter, The last good COD game. 7/10  -RIP COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If your looking for a great campaign you must purchase this game. The single player alone was fantastic, along side the great controls and mechanics. The mutiplayer could have been better. Most of the Multiplayer maps are pretty huge. Only a few are really great. I definetley recomend this game. The online multiplayer is good but, nothing compared to many other call of duty games. If you plan on purchasing this game, enjoy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros:  Great Graphics.  Diffrent Character Customization.  Squad Points.  Clan Wars.  Extinction.  Game Quality.  The Campaign.  The Scorestreaks.  35 Perks!  And My Favourite  The Way You Can Change The Person To Like With The Gamer.    Cons:  The Lag Spike At The Start Of The Game  Bugs  Glitches  Hackers  Slow Ranking  When You get Th Game You Have To Change The Resoloutuion.   In My Opinion COD Ghosts Is One Of My New All Time Favourites Besides Battlefield 4. And Apparently Some Are Better Then Others, My Freind Took A Month To Get To Level 14, And It Took Me 5 Days To Get To Level 25! Whoever Gives Ghosts A Bad Review Is Probally A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Who Sucks At The Game, So Dont Listin To Thier Reamarks, Why Dont You Listin To Reason!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I simply couldnt understand why gamers would not recommend to other gamers? Is it because the quality isn't the same anymore or is it just 'I got high-specs pc and I was hoping this game would run smooth with my GC &amp; stuff??'. Its always complaining.. complaining &amp; complaining.. you guys never appreciate the hardwork of men &amp; women who developed this game and yet still complaining.. For once guys, should be greatfull for what you have. If you dont want play in PC, go buy a console like a PS4. For me, this game is great &amp; my friends love it and we all buy it, So take all your complains and shoved it the toilet &amp; flush it.. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL FPS GAMERS.. Low specs / High specs.. it doesn't matter what computer you have its the enjoyable while playing with your friends."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game  destroyed by lack of anti cheat  billion dollar industry cuts it own throat when it lets hackers run rampant on line 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,better than bops2 at least you can hit people in this game and knife them and they die. black ops2 is only cracked up to be a pretty game and nothing more. ghost is my favorite cod game next to mw2 and mw3.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its nice , but no dedicated servers !!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok. After playing this game for some months now I am going to recommend this game despite the many negative reviews and publicity it got. If you are true Call of Duty fan I would recommend this game to players. Now looking at the system requirements I would STRONGLY ADVISED that you pay attention to the RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS if you want the best gameplay experience. Let's face it you cannot expect to run a 'NexGen Game' on 'LastGen' hardware: it just would not work. Now let's look at the pros and cons of this game.  Pros.  1. Solid Single Campaign. Good Storyline.  2. Various game modes to play in multiplayer.  3. Various customization on guns, loadouts, characters etc.  4. New gameplay mechanic in multiplayer for example fewer shots to kill your opponents online.  5. New game modes added such as SafeGuard, Squads &amp; Extinction which is really fun.  6. A lot Of Downloadable Content especially for Season Pass holders allowing for more longevity of the game.  7. Stellar Graphics providing that you meet the below Recommended system requirements.  8. A Clan mode feature which is a Call of Duty first. Ideally for competitive players.  Cons.  1. The system requirements can be a huge barrier to most PC owners seeing that they may not have the budget to meet those system requirements.  2. An Unoptimized game. Based on the COD community it is said that people who have average to high end systems they reported that their game was giving problems on max settings.  3. Hackers still exists in this game. Probably one of main reasons why the community doesn't have much players. Which leads to point...  4. Hard to find players on all game modes. You find players on TDM, Domination, Kill Confirm and S &amp; D  5. Surprisely this game doesn't have a 'Ping indicator' like its predecessors.  I know a lot of people might disagree with this recommendation but I am personally having fun with this game especially the DLC and its customization. I personally believe that this game is a great game and it would have been better if weren't for hackers destroying the COD community gameplay experience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy until it gets fixed- which will take a longtime - not worth money right now, not optmised and missing key features, back to BO2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"enjoying squads but don't enjoy extinction, it is not what i expected."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love the game! Only getting good now after about three months at it, had a bit of work with tweaking settings to get it running properly on my machine, but now it is running perfectly! I think the gameplay is great, perks, streaks etc are all top notch. Takes a little bit of time to get used to how it all works, probably why people whine out about it, they are lazy!   Anyway, well worth the few quid!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I find it sad for me to buy a new graphic card just to play Ghost. I have GTX 560, 8gb of ram &amp; 3.6 quad core cpu &amp; i cant even play the game in the low settings. It lags even in the menu. I think i'm gonna stick with Black Ops 2 a little longer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS, alot of them are obviously fanboys of other FPS's and are not giving a balanced view. this game is very good, yes another Call of Duty copy and paste job, but the single player has some nice epic cinematic elements mixed with the raw unrivaled insanity which the Call of Duty campaign has been known to deliver, Multiplayer is what everyone knows and (Most) love, its simplistic and easy to get into (If more people would play it) unfortunately this game of late has suffered from, which i can only assume as either frustrations of loyal fans and/or the blind ignorance of said other fanboys writing false reviews, because the servers are suffering.   main problem at the moment with the multiplayer is hackers, and balance issues, the matchmaking seems to be trying to make 'noobs' lose (For example, 10 players 5 prestiged at least once and 5 mid 20's, so the matchmaking makes ALL the 20ish ranks in one team, and the seasoned vets of Ghosts in the other, obviously the 'noobs' get horrificly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) but hopefully the Ghosts team will address this issue before pumping out more DLC. (Thats more a request to the Dev team, less paid for DLC and more in-game fix's, yea?) so Multiplayer a solid 7-10 (Would be more if these issues of balance and Hacking addressed)  Single player, a nice (over the top) story, packed full with explosions over the top dialog and SPACE! yea you read right, you shoot people in space. whats more to say? polished, enjoyable and SPACE MOTHER F**KER. 9/10 (Sorry if you class 'Space' as a spoiler, but you'll thank me)  Otherall 8/10. Call of duty, if you liked the previous games, buy it. its more of the same."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is great, the balance is great now after the patches and its really fun. DLC weapons are balanced too, so its not pay to win. Extinction is fun with friends and i love it. The only downside i can find is the graphics issue. Stutering and framedrops are a common issue or permament issue in the game for most PCs. It only goes for the multiplayer on my PC, dunno why. Extinction works perfectly on high graphics, Campaign too, but the mp has lots of framedrops. Still, if you have a good PC and love Aliens and a Great Campaign.. .this game has it :)                  Dont read this, it is pointless now after the patches   *Before the patches (first month after release i wrote this) [Just dont buy this game. No logic whatsoever in weapon characteristics. In multiplayer you can only see a few weapons that everybody uses (AK12, Honeybadger, MSBS and Bulldog) i havent seen anyone use anything different in a while. Graphics problems on MP are enormous and it doesnt matter what kind of PC you have, cause it can LAG like hell on high-end PCs. Campaign is EPIC and i love it, the story is not as good as the story from the MW series, but much better than the BO series. Poor optimization, low average IQ of the community, lack of weapon usage in MP, lack of game modes, lots of campers.... These things make the game not worth buying or playing (at least for MP and Extinction).]"

Due to the new perk system and customization you can make a soldier that completely represents your playstyle. The sliding and leaning are really nice,refreshing addon of the game. The field orders are nice in-game 'challenges' which can be really rewarding sometimes. The dynamic map change is also a fun extra,similar to Battlefield 4's levolution,sometimes it can completely change the way to play on a map. Kill streaks are okay,there are a plenty of them but there are some useless ones too and the Guard Dog behaves really unrealistic and it's kinda OP. There are a bit few weapons and some iconic ones are missing (G-36,Scar,Glock etc.) but you still can find the one that suits the best for you. There are some maps and sadly I don't own the DLCs but they are still enough and the map design is great. And I say it again the character customization is epic. Not the weapons but the looks can be chaged. It's a really great thing to 'Play' with especially if you like this funciton as much as I do. Extinction is a great co-op mode too. The 1st map is nice and well there isn't any story it's still great and fun to play,I like it better than zombies and I'd like to continue the saga but as I said I don't have the DLCs. I think the developers made a nice job they put a lot of nice and fun content in their game. I recommend it to everone who loves quick,intense CQB actions."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Exctinction=AWESOME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Since Fov, its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is awesome but multiplayer is full of hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game!  You need to buy this game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Amazing visual's on ultra settings.  CUTE DOGE, Story mode was ok, Extinction is amazing, Multiplayer has things that needs to be fixed and some maps are too big but its good old boots on the ground arcade shooter, The last good COD game. 7/10  -RIP COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game RUNS Perfectly on ULTRA Graphics.  AMD Phenom II X6 1055T Processor 2.8 GHZ 8 GB RAM DDR3 ATI RadeOn 7800 Series {1GB} GHZ Edition 256 Bit DDR5 Windows 7 ULTIMATE with Service Pack 1 x64bit RC4  GREAT Game. GREAT Graphics :3

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very Good Game 10/10 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome game and great story I hope there's gona be another one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Who saying 'this game is s**k'??  This game is Fantastic.  Buy it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very enjoyable single player missions
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the Best game of the Year.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game!  You need to buy this game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a review as much as a two comments. - Although the point of Team Death Match is Kill-to-Death Ratio, the scoring system is ranked by kills only. Thus, an individual with 20 Kills and 30 deaths ranks higher than an individual with 19 kills and 0 deaths. That's just plain silly. - We desperately need a 'one death per game' mode to create a 'realistic' game, rather than the 'run and gun' practiced by most of the (mental?) teens and preteens that play this game.  Give us adults a game!  "

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think this game is in beta. It was not suposed to be for PC but ActiVision had no choice, as the PC Gamers wanted GTA V. Sadly we didn't get GTA V PC (Could release soon) and people were asking for a new game to try out. The only thing left to do was while in process of GTA V PC, was to release another game. Only then was it said 'GTA V PC will not be released due to CoD: Ghosts PC. ActiVision had a game for PC (Ghosts) already released.  This is mainly why CoD: Ghosts PC is laggy, buggy and short. Throughout my Call Of Duty experience CoD: Black Ops 2 has got to be the best yet. CoD: Ghosts should get some credit.  I really apologise for my spelling. Im really sick and tired. New Story!!!! Black Ops 3 Realease Date?? Portal 3 = Conversion?? Goodbye4Now"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very Good Game 10/10 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very enjoyable single player missions
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best storylines in COD history. Get the game if you love single player campgain modes and exstentsion isnt bad either.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,elo i pay for zee uhh cal uf doti an me ges uhhh kill und in der multiplayer das night! nein good for zee uhh me! good game machten! - half mexican half american half german guy.-
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only bad thing about the game is that there are hackers and needs to be optimized for pc.If they fix these problems the game will be perfectly fine !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD Ghosts is a good game due to many different stages, and different kind of games in the same game. I prefer Gungame, but Infected and team death match is nice too."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the worst games I've played, this is a shameful example of a company that has decided that money is the only important factor in a game. So much recycled content and and so many problems that were present in the series from 3+ years ago. There is literally nothing to praise this game for, it does nothing original or exciting and just repeats the same mistakes that has made this series so tiresome.   This game is a must avoid."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghosts... Spooky
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is good and hope a mvoie comes out 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game deservas a shot i am a battlefiel vetaren since battlefield 2 and this game is the bomb so people who say choose ... you dont have to i love both games and you should too the graphics are great aswell.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't know about you but i love this game Not Campaign but Multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's nothing like the Modern Warfare saga. But it is an exciting adventure. the story is worth your while and even if it only takes about 5 hours of singleplayer, there are is also multiplayer and a mode called 'extinction' to explore. It is quite expensive, but to be honest, not really worth the money. It is however a great game for the diehard COD fan. Great sound &amp; music, voiceacting is really good. Dynamic actions keep you going. I give this game a 73/100"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun and creative campaign but with you being a terminator, still one of my favourite campaigns in the whole CoD series (havent played AW much... and its just my opinion)  Multiplayer is ughhh... I dont know. I liked some thing about it like dynamic maps, weps,Create a soldier,Extinction,Squads...  But it was missing smaller maps,league play,game mods,maybe nerf to few weps etc"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Rating this game is a tough one. I got Black Ops 2 before I got this, and that is the better game. That being said, this game really isn't all bad. I enjoy the fact you can play bots in the multiplayer, and Extinction is a fun mode. Do I feel this game could be better? Yes. But there is still fun to be had.   I had issues running it in the past, but those seem to be gone now"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love the game but I got banned for loging onto my account on my friends computer. I love this game its the best I have ever played.  Added: The game is really gun there is a lot of friendly people online, some with Great Sportsmen ship and some who are ragers and get mad easily. Graphics are amazing. The guns in the game look realistic and same with the sound."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is good and hope a mvoie comes out 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like Call of Duty Ghotst! It's awesome.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghosts... Spooky
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome multiplayer. Battlefield has better graphics but COD has better gameplay.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Tbh i like the campaign it has alot of action.  The multiplayer is pretty boring and there is not alot of players playing it.  Is it worth buying it from steam for 60euros?   No.  But for 5euros from let's say gi2a (steam is censoring so i had to add one i on it.)  Yes.  That's all i have to say.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is good. Same style we all know. But, they could have done a better job when you come back to life infront of the other team or beside them, you die again very fast. Alot of players are lagging in the game, for me its only the first 10 seconds when it starts. The number 1 bad side of the game is the number of poeple using hacks , i really hope they change that in the future becose its killing the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Excellent game love the feel and gameplay and the extinction mode is brilliant fun!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game for playing wiht friends
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only bad thing about the game is that there are hackers and needs to be optimized for pc.If they fix these problems the game will be perfectly fine !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's not Modern Warfare, but it not bad...once you get around the bugs."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Better than i thought, good game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well its not a bad game. But; it could had been better. I mean something is missing. Something is wrong and I don't know what it is. It is playable at least.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i really liked it the only concerne i have is that people die within 3 shots please change that
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is awesome and extinction is great to.It's my favorite COD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this game ! Is one of the best games of the year !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,one of the best game i have ever played keep the updates comin boys
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well so far its not something to brag about. Its full of hackers. Game play is glitchie not much on preves games you have made. As for recomending it well each to there own i like it but the hackers make it in posible to have a decent game.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,haters be hating I think its fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BUY IT FO SHO
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fun to play online is awesome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice GAme
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont understand all the hate on this game :/ on of the best CoD's imo 9/10  My top 3 CoD's  bo2 ghosts mw2  Only thing not so good in this game is the size of some maps, like: Siege and Flooded"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game rocks for all ages
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very nice game i lve it i recomend this for u guys as like cod 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is number one of my game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't play the multiplayer aspect as i suck with online FPS games. However the singleplayer is great, so far i'm enjoying it and it's a great game.... and that is coming from someone who doesn't really play CoD.  Buy it, play it, complete it then compete online! :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cod cp (Copy/Paste) : the best cod ever !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've never met any better small maps mp game. Highly addictive :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, performance wise a catastrophy though -.-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Overall, this game was built for Multiplayer. The graphics are certainly a 'step up' from it's predecessors, however there really isn't a 'HUGE LEAP' that i've seen to date. PC gaming is in certain trouble, and getting support for PC gamers is definitely hard to get, ESPECIALLY from Activision!!! The Campaign has a good story line, but is too linear to be 'EPIC'. Extinsion mode is fun, at times, but can be challenging (or TOO challenging) when playing with others that don't understand the mechanics of the game and just run around and shoot things. The game, as a whole, is definitely fun to play, but if you DON'T have it for the PC, I would wait until Treyarch pumps out their update :) They haven't disappointed me yet. ;-)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I play all the COD and BF and i will still buy them just wish there was dedicated servers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game but very diffrent from BO2. has a MW and B01 style
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Edit a few in game options and you can get this game looking sweet.  Game looks great.   I don't see what people are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing about.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very enjoyable, good maps and a vast selection of weapons and arsenal. My only complaint is that I wish they'd fix the game for computers running AMD, because everyoen I've spoken to about Ghosts that have an AMD say it looks terrible, you glitch out constantely, you can see the character models polygons, it's just a huge mess and if they'd just fix this problem there'd be so many more people online and enjoying the product that the game's developers meant for it to be without a clusterscrew of graphical funk. But on my Intel system, the game runs like a charm. But if you have AMD, be warned!!!!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Quote: 'I played this once, and then I knew every corner you could hide around, and now I'm undefeatable'. Games like these need a new engine, whereby it becomes impossible to know the map back to front. Because between server lag and knowledge of every detail of a map makes COD unenjoyable. I do love them, its just when someone comes around a corner shooting, you know you need a new map, and the map is a week old."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buy it for the singleplayer. Avoid the lackluster Multiplayer and stick with the far better Black Ops II for your Call of Duty multiplayer fix. Trust me on this one. The multi is fun for about 10 hours, then the lag, lack of modes and lack of people playing (PC version anyway) will head you back to Black Ops II."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is an awesome game. The online play and Extinction mode make it an excelent game to play again and again.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"n Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of DutyÂ® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game had some issues initally but it is running really good now. The campaing is one of the best COD campaings yet and the alien mode is a blast with friends. The DLC maps also seem to be some of the best DLC maps to date. The game is picking up where black ops 2 left off at this point, If you are a COD fan grab it!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really love that game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How to get holiday sweater camo?!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like it. I don't know why everybody said that it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Got this for free. But not too bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i dont see why everybody is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing about this game, it wasn't meant to be a freakin strategic masterpiece, you play it to have fun, which is what im having. This game may not be awesome but it is a blast to play especially with friends, the campaign is pretty good and apart for a gun or two i think needs to be nerfed but yep if you want to buy the game, go ahead, but i would do it i recommend it, just my opinion"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts..... wasn't bad  well, it wasn't great or anything.  Note: I only play singleplayer, i didnt player any cod ghosts multiplayer, but ive heard it sucks.  But the campaign was exciting and action packed, with many plot twists. The ending can feel a little unsatisfying, but amazing at the same time. Would reccommend this game when its on sale for like 20 bucks "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Tbh i like the campaign it has alot of action.  The multiplayer is pretty boring and there is not alot of players playing it.  Is it worth buying it from steam for 60euros?

Call of Duty: Ghosts,How to get holiday sweater camo?!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really love that game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,reccomend totally and if u wanna just go around and kill SOMETHING once in a while play extinction or go to online play and then go all the way down to private match then go to create a class and do what you want there then press start game and have fun!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Menu lag. At first I thought this was a bad thing but then I realized I was being way to productive with my downtime. This lag helped me with my problems and made me take atleast 3 minutes to select a new gun for my loadouts.  No sound options, this is a good thing though because I love not being able to hear my annoying and obnoxious friends in ventilo or teamspeak because of how loud the music is in the menus  Directional sound, game feels pretty mono, this is ok though because I love surprises! When I'm laying prone, staring down a hallway waiting for that loud walmart boot wearing mofo to pop his head out, I get knifed in the back by that enemy infront of me! Maybe if I had some sound options to see what best fit me I could change this, but that's ok!  Matchmaking. I play game modes that aren't very popular so it's hard to find people to play with sometimes. I'm more of a loner/lone-wolf type player so this is a great thing for me!  In-game/active Matchmaking. You will rarely get new players, if ever to join your game. Don't fret though, this is a good thing because if you're like me this means more downtime and you can sit in spawn with your thumb up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ just that much longer!!  I primarily... actually I only play Hardcore search and des...rescue. So when I got to see I could revive my team mates I was super excited! Not only did this mean my team mates and enemies could be revived but it also meant they could spawn behind me even after pushing through and clearing an area! Superfantastic surprise game mode 10/10 would play again.  That doggy dog kill streak, after I got a few kills I noticed there was a dog barking! So I pressed all thirteen of my killstreak call-in buttons and after I pressed the eigth one there was a dog sitting beside me. Although I think really it was an elephant in disguise because he was so loud the enemies knew exactly where he was, even across the entire battlefield 4 sized map!  Wait times in-game between rounds. By now you should know that I like my downtime and being less productive. But with this 15 second between round wait time I have time to do important things like cook a pound of bacon, read the entire holy bible or even go shovel the walmart parking lot in my town."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Forget the anti-COD circlejerk. This is a polished game with very few bugs, one of the best CoD games they've put together. The multiplayer is just what CoD is known for, smaller maps with consistant action and good objective based team play on game modes like Blitz and Domination. There's some great new game modes like Search and Rescue (think of Search and Destroy only you can revive your teammates), Bliz (which is like a CTF mode but you only need to make it to the enemy base), and they've added all the old favorites like TDM and even Gun game. There's also a few squad based co-op modes worth checking out, and a pretty decent singleplayer, with over the top Michael Bay explosions, overly dramatic world ending storyline, and playable dogs!   It's worth checking out. To be completely objective, the one problem the game has it that it does suffer from hackers, there' quite a few in multiplayer. While outright hacking like aimbots and shooting through walls is exceedingly rare, wall hacking is pretty common. Fortunately most of these people are terrible even if they're wall hacking and you can frag them all the same, so it's typically not completely gamebreaking, but can be frustrating."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better than any Counter-strike
Call of Duty: Ghosts,6/10 was not modern warfare 3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really awesome game. Just like all the other CoD's I've played a very strong singleplayer campaign. I really like the multiplayer features. For 5 euro (kin guin) it a real must-get.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 wasn't the last good Call of Duty, Call of Duty Ghosts was"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"--- Call of Duty:Ghosts ---  The campaign started out really weird. I didn't get jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ what was going on from the start. As a matter of fact, the SP campaign is pretty weird all the way through. It's all over the place, but still not in a terrible way. You are in space, you are in dense jungles, crawling around avoiding detection (just like the classic 'All ghillied up' from CoD:MW), you are on high-speed-derailing trains, you drive tanks and helicopters and so on. Turns me off a little. Infinity Ward could have worked a bit harder on a proper story that follow a less rough path.  I got the feeling that they just cherry-picked the most memorable pieces from their previous games and slapped a new skin over it and shipped the new Ghosts. This time you are in some kind of alternative future, like 70 years from now, but without the gadget-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t from Black Ops 3 that I found somewhat questionable...  So what saves CoD:Ghosts from falling short then? The gameplay. It's fun, it's tight, the difficulty is just right (on normal) They introduce the mechanics in a nice tempo. I played it on normal and it offered somewhat of a challange. Not like BO3, but I thought it was perfect since I'm not HaRDcoRe. I just wanna have fun.  And the game looks really good for a CoD that is 4 years old. Decent amount of detail in the levels, decent amount of polys used, but the textures is to low res for my liking.  TL;DR...  - Solid gameplay. - Well balanced. - Tight controls. - Variety in the SP campaign. For good or bad... - Sluggish weapon handling and 'tame' impact from them. For some reason, in this CoD, the weapons felt a bit like pee-shooters. I want more 'oomph' in my guns when I murder bad guys all willie-nillie. (The rest of your actions suffers from the same weird behavior - throwing frags and so on - is sluggish... Really strange. What works tho - as it always has - is the movement. It's tight CoD-style. - I would prefer higher resolution textures tho. After playing BO3 or DOOM2016 this feels like a trip back in time. (which it is but anyway...) - 'Perfect length' according to me, it did not overstay it's welcome, but I did NOT like the horrible cliffhanger that they leave you with at the end. - Imho, Ghosts is better then BO3 and maybe even BO2.  Final verdict....  Around 7.5/10 I would say, even if it has flaws like the (mostly) unsatisfying gunplay. The reason is simple. It was really fun to blast through the campaign. However, at it's current pricepoint of $50-60, I would recommend that you do some research of your own before pressing that Buy-button."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,  Campaing is awesome 10/10  Multiplayer is awesome 9/10 (I hate hackers)  NEED MORE PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, i did NOT do the game enough justice because of my lower end hardware if you play it on a higher end rig it is pretty awesome, it revived the CoD series (it died the moment black ops 1 was released aaaand was brutally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the moment black ops 2 came out) The game feels fresh and Good. I recommend it but you will need 8Gb of ram Gtx 750 ti or Gtx 760 an i5"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can't stop playing!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I can't believe this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s get away making a game that looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ runs even worst than it looks......I'M NEVER BUYING ANOTHER CALL OF DUTY...... EVER !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I teabagged a guy. 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's an ok game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes its fun even though the 6 v 6 thing with big maps but its preety gewd.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Epic game. Good graphics. Nice story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game is very good,the only downfall is the hackers,get rid of them infinity ward and steam,then the game would be brill also would be a good idea to run the game on 64bit instead of 32bit"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would recommend this game if you have a high end PC with 8GB or more RAM and a nice graphics card. The Single Player Campaign can be a little clichÃ© at times but it is still pretty engaging as the characters develop. The Extinction mode is fun too as it is a different experience to Zombies and deginately much better than the survival modes they had in MW3/MW2. Multiplayer is where the problems start to show. This game is meant to be a fast paced arcade style shooter but since there are only 6 vs 6 on PC and the maps are huge, it is slow paced. The high end PC statement I said earlier really shows on the MP modes as this game is unoptimized and with a middle tier PC you will find yourself having extremely unbareable framerates and you will find yourself getting killed around corners or from people who aren't even on your screen. It is a nice change to the franchise and it is a superior game compared to the recent Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3. The only thing that is a set back to the PC version is mainly the unoptimization but it can be solved by having a high end graphics card such as a Titan or a GeForce GTX760."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if your a cod lover go for it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very good game only the maps are very big
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same call of duty game as before. Although it does have nice effects previous Call of Dutys lacked. Overall 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i love this game, after the patch i started to play again and wow i love it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you buy this game you are stupid! This game is for determining the best hacks, as all hackers play this game. Don't get me wrong it is a great game for xbox and playstation, but on pc it is crap, low player base and filled with hackers. Only buy this game much later on for the campaign once the price comes down a lot... Just my opinion though... :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its a great game, i tried campaign and multiplayer, it is definitely CoD Mw2 successor.        "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very ood game but for me if i change to many settings i cant shoot plz try to fix the bug but besides that 10/10 game of the year
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was a true successor to the Call Of Duty Franshise, tho people claim its laggy, 3 words: your computer sucks. My computer handles it JUST FINE. never lag, no buggy graphics. Fine"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love this game but have been getting eaten alive..Been a while so still crazy rusty!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love it. a massive fan of the franchise and still havent been bored out by repetitiveness. an amazong installment in the series and really looking forward to what comes next!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought during Steam Summer Sale. I highly suggest waiting for the next sale to pick up COD: Ghosts.  Minor texture problems, even on max settings. A quick google search and a small downloaded config file later remedies this.  Be prepared to get slaughtered the first few times playing online, some people's skills are unholy in this game.  Addictive online gameplay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well..... I dont know what creators thought but they made this.. there is nothing wrong with the game in singleplayer (good graphics for not that beefy pcs) and great plot as always. MULTIPLAYER - is a failure... Guns are not great, movement and maps are weird and the multi isnt that good.... but it is a great Singleplayer game..  Recommended only for singleplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"very good game, cant stop playing"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Loved the campaign on this call of duty i think it was the best one so far :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of my favourite games to play at the moment
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game but it sucks cause it wont pick up a lot of the multiplayer games and the campign freezes up when its loading but overall its a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Multiplayer!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, poor anticheat"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A very good game, impressive maps and weappons but it requires a lot of resources from your PC. If the game is laggy and works in frame a reduced quality and resolution helps. Like in all COD games cheaters are all over and it seams that the creators cannot or don't want to do anything about them. Too bad. They ruin the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pretty good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good graphics, nice gameplay and endless hours of fun"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought this game as an accident at my store. i tryed to return it but they wouldnt. even though it was eligible    even the retailers dont want it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good gameplay. Lots of players.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is one of the best from CoD series, epic story, balanced, good graphics.... Someone may disagree with me, but this is really nice ride! Catching the photocopier with your face. FTW!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't the get the hate on this game. This Call of Duty has something that all it's past competitors don't and that is SOLDIER CUSTOMIZATION. For the love of God. Finally I can customize my soldier like I want to and hell the single player isn't too bad is slightly above average. But the multiplayer is really fun with this custom soldiers. Is a great call of duty in my opinion. 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'd like to start by saying I really loved this game and that Its extremely underrated.  Story: Although the game has some cheesy dialogue I still found the story quite interesting. The characters are easy to relate to and quite well voiced. Since Ghosts is the first in a new series I feel that Infinity Ward should have done what Treyarch for Black Ops did scrapped the whole silent protagonist as that would not have broken cannon and would have been much more fitting.  Textures and graphics: This is where the game did not quite impress me the textures were horrible; Call of duty games before this did better but I found that it was considerably better in the campaign.  Multiplayer: Ghosts has lots of game modes but sadly there is hardly ever anyone on game modes that are not team death match or free for all. I also found that maps were a bit to big and decided to go for a more Battlefield approach which made for a larger emphasis on tactical game play rather than just another mad shooter.  How much would I pay for it?: Honestly i would pay a maximum of $15-$25. Get it when it next goes on sale.  Overall thoughts: Call of duty ghosts is not the best Call of duty game to grace our PCs but it is still a good game. When I told my friends I was going to buy this game they were completely against the idea of it but when I asked why they said it was a bad game they would just reply with its just a bad game, I don't get it. sometimes someone would say something like the maps were to big which I can agree with but its no reason to not buy the game. I could go into more detail about it but your just going to watch a review on it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,single player was well worth the price
Call of Duty: Ghosts,still need improvements but it is a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"better then black ops 2,character customization is nice,guns are fair,maps are made so that it can be changed by destroying stuff,overall epic. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Seems to be a cheaters paradise.I dont know why they cant do anything about all it. Sure,you can report it, but that seems to fall on deaf ears. Please fix it! It is a great game if you can clean it up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best game ever has lots of action EVEYTHING!!!!!!!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I feel this the best ever for male and female players BUT hacker are a problem, plz get on this !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another fast-paced, action game from Infinity Ward in the Call of Duty franchise. The campaign sees you as Logan Walker trying to win back the U.S from the Federation. It is an intense and action-packed game with twists that are not so forseen. The end is a particular example of this but I don't want to spoil it :P. Ik the PC community for CoD has been detreriorating but I am CoD fan and I won't stop playing it anytime soon. I just hope you enjoy it as much as I do if you plan on getting it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought during Steam Summer Sale. I highly suggest waiting for the next sale to pick up COD: Ghosts.  Minor texture problems, even on max settings.

Addictive online gameplay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Was bad at release, has since been improved. If you tried it out earlier and didn't like it, I'd give it another go. 7.5/10 so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best Call of Duty ever, and best first person shooter ever made. 10/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,11/10 Would be attacked by men out of sand again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's cod.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Probably the best of CoD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A game that will make you want to be a ghost... but not the dead spooky type of ghost, but rather a ghost that answers its call of duty, no matter what challenges lie ahead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,An awesome FPS game for those who are new to the Call Of Duty franchise....highly recomend it if u can get used to a few annoying issues such as the random framerate drops and stuttering audio for load scenes. Story is very good in my opinion with a very interesting ending. The graphics are on par in this day and age but nothing outstanding here. Will buy the sequel if it does come out :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Some bad failings aside this is the most innovative CoD game in years. If you're rating this game on singleplayer, you're a joke. The amount of players getting CoD or BF games for single player at this point is so small it's not even worth measuring.  With the major changes to the class system to contextual changes to objects in the environment over to the characters calling out enemy positions this game is just a lot of fun. Weapons feel a little more balanced compared to Blops 2 and MW3. Assault rifles feel a lot more on par with SMGs.  Lag compensation still needs to go and continuing to take choice away from players (no filters on matchmaking at all) are both frustrating."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A great game, love the story, the spawn points in multiplayer are not the best but it is still a great game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I merely buy this game because I like it's single player campaign.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very cool game, it requires much performance from your computer, but when you have it you can play like a boss :) The new Perk system is a really good idea :) i still miss the P90 UMP45 from MW2 :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are way too big and too much extra crap going on. Squad member setup is kind of pain. Still a good game, though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,they couldn't see me..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes ghsots is a really good game with the best graphics ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this Game and its better with you get it for PC...Bcause you dont want to fight your freinds like get this or whatever.My point is its a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE MULTIPLAYER IS FRICKIN AWESOME AND I LOVE THE CAMPAIGN
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty: Ghosts is by all means a great game with nice graphics and game play. I'm a aging gamer chick and only played 4 hours so far but I know a great game when I play one. For those who haven't played this game is totally missing out on a awesome game. I highly recommend Call of Duty: Ghosts.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game. Have played it lots and you recommend it to most people.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game But people die so quick
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game in history! dont waste your money on this pce of crap!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love it, I don't know why people are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on it but it needs more players ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very good game only the maps are very big
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game is very good,the only downfall is the hackers,get rid of them infinity ward and steam,then the game would be brill also would be a good idea to run the game on 64bit instead of 32bit"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I feel this the best ever for male and female players BUT hacker are a problem, plz get on this !!!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sick on pc 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its cool game but maybe it will be better if they will fix the fps problems
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is ok but they can do better  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,is it just my laptop i have a alienware 14 750m 1gb gddr5 i7 4700 processer i cant play campagin it crashes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, poor anticheat"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is an ok game and it is pretty fun, and I am a COD fan (have been for a while), but I would choose Battlefield 4 over COD: Ghosts without question. COD is getting boring now, and even with all of the new features in Ghosts, it's not the same as it used to be. Personally, MW3 was my favourite. I had it on PS3 and I got really good at it. But BO2 wasn't great, and that's when I started loosing interest.  The new game modes in Ghosts are absolutely awful though... I'm really disappointed with that.  I rate Ghosts 6/10 because I am feeling kind."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A very good game, impressive maps and weappons but it requires a lot of resources from your PC. If the game is laggy and works in frame a reduced quality and resolution helps.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is a really good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its 1 off the best games in the cod history but its get boring after a while...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This i just amazing... COD is back with a cracking story... Join Multiplayer with friends... or relax with the singleplayer storymode &lt;&lt;&lt;Peace&gt;&gt;&gt; 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How can i buy a gun from here 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game love to play it there are so many things you can do I never get board of it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,We need to make Call of Duty great again on pc so guys about 10k people need to download it and start play so we will play it its good game and black ops 3 too people you buy game and trow on trash are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ after you play it on ps4 30 fps medium graphics omg.. we need to make it great 10k people need to play ti all time! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty: Ghosts is the same COD has last year and the year before that with a little better graphics and with the same gameplay we all came to love. It is about time they change it up. You will like the game it plays well and looks ok the online play is just as good and the story is ok. My review score is 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really bugs me the amount of cheating that goes on here. Not only that do we ever get a respons about reporting cheaters? NO! Its a lot of money for some people to spend and then get walked over by punters AND the makers of the game. Apart from that I still enjoy the game very much. Especially when there are NO cheaters about.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,honey badger masterrace
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game I enjoy The multiplayer version and finally got it to function correctly the graphic card settings
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really good and I recommend it. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Found this to be one of the better COD games and believe me, I have played each and every one of them. The extra modes and DLC puts a really exciting twist on the game! I just wish the cheating crap was dealt with as it makes the multi-player side miserable"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the new concepts. I read negative reviews about the levelling system and use of squad points. One review said, 'yeah, it may cater to people who value their time- but I did not have that gotta play one more map feeling. ' I worried about this, but now I realize it was a good. Having a good time playing it, like picking up all the weps and trying them out, then choosing to get it at any level, and trick it out just like I want it.. coz.. this aint my first rodeo. Recommend"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"to much cheaters on game,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IDK why every hates this game......personally i like it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is balanced except Bulldog,Campaign is pretty fun and Extinction is better than Black Ops 3 Zombies... Really? What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. IW did better job than Zombies team..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome story line made me want to play it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can finally remove this game from my account, thanks valve :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is probably one of the best CoD's of all time!!!! CoD Ghosts Had brought me the best multiplayer experience, and one of the best campaigns. Many peaple judge the game by its look, and the different multiplayer. My personly opinion is that the fans of Cod (some not all) are one of the dumpest persos i have ever heard of!!! They said that CoD should make difference, then Ghosts came and the peaple started to complain about the different multiplayer system. Infinityward actully listen to the comunity and brought them a new experience, AND THEN THEY COMPLAIN!!! I don't think that that is fair, i mean come on they did as you said, APPRECIATE IT!  Peaple also say that the game has a bad campaigne and that the game has bad previwes, but if you see the profesionel previwes on youtube you will probebly think about it one more time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,New Orleans
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game 10/10 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"YES!!!, Best Game I ever played. Best Grafics, amazing maps,awesome weapons. I only would wish for the developers to add more interactive/distructive areas in maps, like in BF4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its pretty fun but you will get killed by bs things :).
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a good game not the best cod but still good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,need South Africa put on the list plz
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game , has a fun campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD revolution -=- FPS - best graphics.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok first off I've played all the call of duty series at one point or another. Ok so thats out of the way, theres really only a couple reasons his game isnt better rated for me. one the hackers , but it seems there trying to fix it it has gotten alot better, Two no server list or private servers, but we might never get those back so I ll deal with out it. This game doesnt crash for me. All and all its ok leave the idea of the past out of your decision to buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes i got it at mardens for $24 and it had all dlc content
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you play this game on single player and it glitches or lags in anyway, then there is a problem with your pc. So, if you come in multiplayer the game will still lag. Now onto networking. If your internet is s h i t then the game will lag, if the host internet is s h i t then everyone in the game except the host will lag. so please dont talk bad about the game when other issues needs to get taken care of first.  Now about the game; only fools would say this game is different from black ops 2 and modernwarefare 3 ( i chose those 2 because they are the ones ive played). Its the same gameplay with a different perk or character upgrade system. I haven't seen a hacker yet, when my ping time to the server i am playing on slows down, I am a few mili seconds behind other players, so most likely i will die (that is not hacking). Buy the game and give it a try."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,We all know that both cod and bf4 are worst enemies as both of these games r top sellers but if u wanna make a tuff decision in buying either cod gosts or bf4 ur gonna have to look into wich ur more interested in....single player or multiplayer ?....id say if u wanna have one of these games for the single player u should rather purchase cod ghosts as it has way better action scenes and if u wanna buy a game for multiplayer u should definitely be looking at bf4 wich destroyes cods multiplayer....i would not recommend buying this game on steam as it is entirely overpriced i bought my cod at bt games for 25 usd wich was way cheaper......the decision is yours....cod...or....bf4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,better than Black ops 2 but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ spawn system in multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This has brought nack to modern ware 2 feel but with a new taste and look.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought the game. I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. I played the game. I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. CoD = â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Nuff Said.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Ghosts. Heh its a good game a very good game more than five thousand people have the game and its AWESOME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,most playable multiplayer game since MW2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best fps games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best game this year ive played btw servers are always down 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"8/10 i would've given it more ..but again it seems that there are no left handed games testers -or the ones there are -aren't trying to break the game -to fix the game. again a game where you remap your keys -only to find that although all the game is correctly inverted  -the missiles you steer are all basic direction? ..Here's Snoop's version 'bowwowyippikiyaydontmakesensemuthalover!' for a 2014 game thats clearly had money, people,love and time -thrown at it to this extent.  ..its such a shame remapping of keys is still such an overlooked fault. Rich 0range [LeftHanded Disabled Gamer]"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TRY IT BEFORE YOU HATE IT.  IT FEELS DIFFERENT IT IS DIFFERENT AND ITS GOOD. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE IS TIRED OF CALL OF DUTY, THAT THEY`RE SAYING THAT ITS JUST THE SAME GAME AS THE LAST ONE. BUT NOT THIS TIME THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER CALL OF DUTY THIS IS GHOSTS I LOVE IT AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY GIVE IT A CHANCE"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PC EDITION (mutli-player)  Started out horrible!! No dedicated servers... no changable FOV, and a LOT of cheaters! I felt I had wasted my money (pre-order no less).  Overt time, the 'fixes' have improved gameplay considerably. They have changed the fixed 65 degree FOV to go up to 80 (better than nothing). I have a high end gaming rig and still had to lower video settings to help offset the horrible lag compensation.  Sadly, so much time has gone by that there are not nearly as many people playing the game as there could have been.  I wish they were more agressive against the blatant cheaters in the game. Heck, even the in-game mechanics to report a cheater shows how little thought or care went into this.  Still, there is a good, solid group of folks who play the game, and I do enjoy playing when they are around."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really not as bad as people make out, coming to the end of it's lifespan as a series but still worth a play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's okay I suppose
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cod sucks go play bf4 instead
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this cod but only because i started playing the newer cods when they came out. if u are new to cod this game is awesome unlees u dont have the specs but if u are a older cod gamer just stick with the older cods
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the one with the dog!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a must have title, I personally think black ops 2 and pretty much most previous CoDs were far better than Ghosts. Although Ghosts is a somewhat decent game, there is a lack of support on the PC side of things. Sometimes you will get into hacked lobbies, no FOV slider, poor optimization, and just a lack of fixed makes this game a pretty bad port. If you have a console too and are debating on which platform to get Ghosts on go with your console, but if you only play PC and still want to experience CoD, there is a FOV mod out there which I'm almost positive won't get you banned and if you lower some settings or have some pretty decent hardware the game still runs fluidly. So in all, it's not a must have addicting game, but generally not too bad either. The campaign was very good as well. It took me 6 hours to complete, but if you're better than I am you can probably finish in 4. I wouldn't want to replay the campaign but it was still a fun experience, a few story line aspects fall just short though. In all the PC/Steam version of this game is a 7/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghosts  ( 0-5 ) 5   cool Game cool spil
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Better than how people make it out to be. With that being said - relatively weak storyline, needs more stealth missions. However it is CoD, they have nailed the FPS formula hence why most if not all games since CoD 4 are very similar. Graphics look great (when on Ultra) but you'll need a beefy PC for Riley's Nvidia Hairworks and Antialiasing. I'm running an i7 6700hq with a GTX 970m and 16GB DDR4 rig, on mixed settings between high and maximum i can get 55-60 fps.  7/10 buy only when $25 or less."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ok game like the m player
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very nice game  can't stop playing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are not the best aka i like sniping but over all a decent game, If your system can handle it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love it. a massive fan of the franchise and still havent been bored out by repetitiveness. an amazong installment in the series and really looking forward to what comes next!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Payed $60 for this game.  Took hours to install the campaign and multiplayer (about 80 gb)  didn't work on my computer.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, but no alot of players playing it :S"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well..... I dont know what creators thought but they made this.. there is nothing wrong with the game in singleplayer (good graphics for not that beefy pcs) and great plot as always. MULTIPLAYER - is a failure... Guns are not great, movement and maps are weird and the multi isnt that good.... but it is a great Singleplayer game..  Recommended only for singleplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There are no ghosts in this game  1/10  (decent story but not enough missions in the wasteland area)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hell of the ghosts snipers 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't know why the hate. Its great and like playing a damn movie! People are so spoiled these days.  I can see how they were inspired by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R fRANCHISE. GOOD GAME. 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game Best call of Duty yet :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is verry good game I love this Call of Duty :) 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The multiplayer in this game is really fun. This game is not very tactical, but I had a lot of fun playing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not the best, but realy good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but just tooo much lag and unecessary componets
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game. COD are all puzzle games but this one is better than most of the COD games. Tells a story that is a little far fetched but not bad for a game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why is CALL OF DUTY GHOST breaking down i can not recommend this game when it breakes down
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very nice game  can't stop playing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i got this game for free so im happy with it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaing was okay. Better than most fps shooters made 2013. But when I want to play any kind of Multiplayer in it, 1 frame per minute in the title screen... could not even connect to any server becouse it lost connection... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU INFINITY WARD! &gt;:^( Recomend the campaing, not the online modes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would recommend this game if you have a high end PC with 8GB or more RAM and a nice graphics card. The Single Player Campaign can be a little clichÃ© at times but it is still pretty engaging as the characters develop. The Extinction mode is fun too as it is a different experience to Zombies and deginately much better than the survival modes they had in MW3/MW2. Multiplayer is where the problems start to show. This game is meant to be a fast paced arcade style shooter but since there are only 6 vs 6 on PC and the maps are huge, it is slow paced. The high end PC statement I said earlier really shows on the MP modes as this game is unoptimized and with a middle tier PC you will find yourself having extremely unbareable framerates and you will find yourself getting killed around corners or from people who aren't even on your screen. It is a nice change to the franchise and it is a superior game compared to the recent Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3. The only thing that is a set back to the PC version is mainly the unoptimization but it can be solved by having a high end graphics card such as a Titan or a GeForce GTX760."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,y cannot play !!!!!multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,loving this game

Call of Duty: Ghosts,love more love and LOVE 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sure, reckon its pretty good to play, good areas, cool guns, just find it hard to find the extra download guns,,,,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"8/10 i would've given it more ..but again it seems that there are no left handed games testers -or the ones there are -aren't trying to break the game -to fix the game. again a game where you remap your keys -only to find that although all the game is correctly inverted  -the missiles you steer are all basic direction? ..Here's Snoop's version 'bowwowyippikiyaydontmakesensemuthalover!' for a 2014 game thats clearly had money, people,love and time -thrown at it to this extent.  ..its such a shame remapping of keys is still such an overlooked fault. Rich 0range [LeftHanded Disabled Gamer]"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a good game, but there are a couple of problems such as (textures, spawnes, and you can still quick scope). (even thought infinity award said they prevented quick scopers but all you have to do us use quick draw).but over all the gameplay is good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not to bad story line was great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly speaking, this game had a lot of potential, all lost due to technical issues. But still at half price, this is a must play for any Shooting fan."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,servers are all supe laggy for PC users regardless how high end your pc and graphic card are...terrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i have the sesean pass but can't buy the ripper can anybudy help me?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Whole world got less than 5000 players..good luck searching for games..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought the game. I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. I played the game. I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. CoD = â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Nuff Said.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When playing the game itself i experienced bowel movements like none other, the past few weeks Ive been in and out out of the toilet at least 600 times. The doctor has no words he simply gives the middle finger and tells me **** off. Overall Call of Duty provides help to people with constapation however if you are not experiecing this it can be a major inconvenience. I personally give the game 10/10 but i actually never play it and dont plan to in the future and hate the Call of Duty franchise altogether."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is great for people who like to imagin that people are real and that even if no one joins the lobby you are waiting in, its okay all of you are just figments of an imaginary world created by me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Addictive
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Ghosts. Heh its a good game a very good game more than five thousand people have the game and its AWESOME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,most playable multiplayer game since MW2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best fps games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"8/10 i would've given it more ..but again it seems that there are no left handed games testers -or the ones there are -aren't trying to break the game -to fix the game. again a game where you remap your keys -only to find that although all the game is correctly inverted  -the missiles you steer are all basic direction? ..Here's Snoop's version 'bowwowyippikiyaydontmakesensemuthalover!' for a 2014 game thats clearly had money, people,love and time -thrown at it to this extent.  ..its such a shame remapping of keys is still such an overlooked fault. Rich 0range [LeftHanded Disabled Gamer]"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TRY IT BEFORE YOU HATE IT.  IT FEELS DIFFERENT IT IS DIFFERENT AND ITS GOOD. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE IS TIRED OF CALL OF DUTY, THAT THEY`RE SAYING THAT ITS JUST THE SAME GAME AS THE LAST ONE. BUT NOT THIS TIME THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER CALL OF DUTY THIS IS GHOSTS I LOVE IT AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY GIVE IT A CHANCE"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very Good game !!!! Good gameplay
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good gameplay. Lots of players.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good graphics, nice gameplay and endless hours of fun"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought this game as an accident at my store. i tryed to return it but they wouldnt. even though it was eligible    even the retailers dont want it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best game for people that cant buy the black ops
Call of Duty: Ghosts,what ever others say story line was fun to play and I am totally gonna buy ghosts 2 when it realeses. I couldnt get out of the computer while playing it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't the get the hate on this game. This Call of Duty has something that all it's past competitors don't and that is SOLDIER CUSTOMIZATION. For the love of God. Finally I can customize my soldier like I want to and hell the single player isn't too bad is slightly above average. But the multiplayer is really fun with this custom soldiers. Is a great call of duty in my opinion. 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes its fun even though the 6 v 6 thing with big maps but its preety gewd.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not that great better off with cs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a very good game... Good gameplay but a bit laggy in multiplayer sometimes which annoys a lot...!!!!!! But Iam happy with this purchase.... so Thumbs Up. :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,single player was well worth the price
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game but it sucks cause it wont pick up a lot of the multiplayer games and the campign freezes up when its loading but overall its a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great storyline and gameplay. Graphics were pleasing and the detail was phenomenal. Very realistic. Seemed a bit short at 8 hours with relaxed pace. Gore was kept to a minimum and language was mostly fine until more towards the end. The language during the credits were especially foul, however, but easy enough to simply turn it off if you're like me and prefer actual maturity over 'mature' content. The audio was a bit of a problem during cut scenes/loading. It would chop in and out and requires Vertical Sync to be turned off to fix it. I'm rather disappointed that they didn't catch and fix that bug. All in all, I think it was very well done and worth the play if you like FPS games and quality realism of environment."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, poor anticheat"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great single player, multiplayer is good as usual"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,of course I reccomend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD never fails to please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This has brought nack to modern ware 2 feel but with a new taste and look.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,biggest pice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ive ever played in my life never buy it does not even work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Such shooter, so amaze. Wow!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"to much cheaters on game,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really liked CoD:Ghosts, the story is interesting and the graphics is brilliant (on ultra high settings). I finished the game too quickly though on Hardened level, but noticed I had only located 5% of the Rorke files, need to replay and see if I can find more, but then I think I'll go up to Veteran level instead to get a little more challenge from the game. The ending was a little unexpected and I can't wait to see if there will be a sequel in the future."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Oh, another cod game borrrrrrinn- wait it has... 4 GAME MODES????? 4 AGHSADGKASGHJGSAHJGKASJDGASGKADGS SO MANY HOURS OF PLAY YAY FOR EXTINCTION! OH YOU LIKED THE HUMAN SURVVIAL? ITS TSILL THERE CAMPAIGN MULTIPLAYER EXTINCTION AND SQUADS YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you play this game on single player and it glitches or lags in anyway, then there is a problem with your pc. So, if you come in multiplayer the game will still lag. Now onto networking. If your internet is s h i t then the game will lag, if the host internet is s h i t then everyone in the game except the host will lag. so please dont talk bad about the game when other issues needs to get taken care of first.  Now about the game; only fools would say this game is different from black ops 2 and modernwarefare 3 ( i chose those 2 because they are the ones ive played). Its the same gameplay with a different perk or character upgrade system. I haven't seen a hacker yet, when my ping time to the server i am playing on slows down, I am a few mili seconds behind other players, so most likely i will die (that is not hacking). Buy the game and give it a try."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,We all know that both cod and bf4 are worst enemies as both of these games r top sellers but if u wanna make a tuff decision in buying either cod gosts or bf4 ur gonna have to look into wich ur more interested in....single player or multiplayer ?....id say if u wanna have one of these games for the single player u should rather purchase cod ghosts as it has way better action scenes and if u wanna buy a game for multiplayer u should definitely be looking at bf4 wich destroyes cods multiplayer....i would not recommend buying this game on steam as it is entirely overpriced i bought my cod at bt games for 25 usd wich was way cheaper......the decision is yours....cod...or....bf4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Game For COD games Its Really Give us New Gameplay mod New things thx for Call of duty ^^
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IDK why every hates this game......personally i like it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is balanced except Bulldog,Campaign is pretty fun and Extinction is better than Black Ops 3 Zombies... Really? What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. IW did better job than Zombies team..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really not as bad as people make out, coming to the end of it's lifespan as a series but still worth a play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's okay I suppose
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes i got it at mardens for $24 and it had all dlc content
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excelant game,probably the best visuals by far.i would highly Recomend it !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While this is probably one of the most polished Call of Duty games, honestly.... I'm burnt out on them. This one included. The Campaign mode is just like every other CoD since the first one. It just feels like a expansion for Black Ops though. Yes there are some space and underwater battle scenes, building rappelling, tank, helicopter, a remote-control dog scene, and a monorail scene complete with shaky ground that breaks up the typical formula's poke-your-head-out-and-get-shot-dead-from-out-of-nowhere monotony that you've all come to know. I just don't think the mixed gameplay is enough to save it however. Graphically, the game looks amazing... but it's the SAME GAME and with the gaming graphics plateauing across the industry, this is just not good enough any more. I'm just too old for this now.  The campaign plot itself is a new low for incredibly B-movie styled hokey, with no self-effacing gag to at least give a knowing wink to the silliness. The plot only feels tacked on to give some measure of weak cohesion with all the set-pieces. I have to wonder with the billions in sales why Activision can't afford to bother some best-selling military fiction writers to pen something with some more thematic substance and maturity... something that gets me thinking about things more than 'war is bad'. At least with the early Call of Duty games, I got to learn about the battles of WW2. Now? ...I just learn about some futuristic wank.  However, we all know that most CoD players come for the multiplayer, right? Well, this is always the game's saving grace because it's pretty much the only thing people buy the game for. There are some interesting modes here. Extinction is a kind of mash up of what make CoD Zombies good, except that the aliens are not scary and just annoying. For more 4 player fun, try the squads Safeguard mode. This proves to be similar to MW2's enjoyable survival modes, and is a lot of fun, with my only complaint that you can't play solo with AI like you can with extinction.  In short... Activition is just going to keep making these games because they make a boatload of money with each generation of new players. I waited until I got this on steam discount because I no longer believe that it's worth the silly dollars they're asking at launch.... but having said that, if you're a CoD junkie it's pretty much an essential purchase. You'll buy it anyway... just like the next installment, and even if they replace all the guns with poo-flingers for the inevitable sequel."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, but it doesn't run as fluent as Black Ops 2 MP......."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lots of entertainment, very nice graphics."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best cod by far 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why people judge this game so bad.  Compared to BF4, yes BF4 has better graphics and gameplay (due to driving Tanks, planes, etc.)  But to me CoD Ghosts, the bullets or netcode actually hits when you shoot unlike BF4. The movement with the character is better than BF4. The only downside to it is the graphics. It still looks amazing, but expected more from CoD. Online play is fun aswell."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ok game like the m player
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are not the best aka i like sniping but over all a decent game, If your system can handle it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont know why so many people complain about this game. It is a good game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not Bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There are no ghosts in this game  1/10  (decent story but not enough missions in the wasteland area)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, but no alot of players playing it :S"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There are no ghosts in this game  1/10  (decent story but not enough missions in the wasteland area)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Post people are bad talking CoD:Ghosts but I see no reason to. It is really fun to play, and I highly recemend it to anyone.  Also it is cool that instead of zombies you have a real storyline, and you fight aliens.   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't the get the hate on this game. This Call of Duty has something that all it's past competitors don't and that is SOLDIER CUSTOMIZATION. For the love of God. Finally I can customize my soldier like I want to and hell the single player isn't too bad is slightly above average. But the multiplayer is really fun with this custom soldiers. Is a great call of duty in my opinion. 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A very different Call of Duty game, but in a good way. Infinity Ward did an amazing job on this game. In my own opinion, the changes they made to multiplayer were great. For one, you die more often than in any other Call of Duty game out there, making this game require real, tactical skill. This change is being bashed by many, many people because most, if not all, Call of Duty players do not know how to play smart, therefore they get frustrated. All-in-all, a wonderful game, both in multiplayer and campaign. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a different Call of Duty experience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,can somebody tell me the steps to buy the ripper? I have never used the store
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghosts  ( 0-5 ) 5   cool Game cool spil
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cod sucks go play bf4 instead
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too many expesive map packs 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, so now your reading my review after seeing the countless other people saying its crap. Its really not. Yes i agree, the game isnt put together as well as it should have been, with a COUPLE glitches; mainly in Icandy. However if you turn down the graphics image quality setting in the advanced video settings, it works perfectly with great image still. The singleplayer is awesone and Multiplayer keeps its high standards. Adding Extinction really kicked this game higher. Get it on PC, you wont reget it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Using the same engine since 2005, Call of Duty 2. They call it Next Generation. The story seems interesting and is the only reason I will suffer through it. So far not even close to worth money. Maybe for free accept it. Other than that don't waste you're time. I got this game cheap, so far not worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Got this game for 20 dollars from a store......just putting that out there.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really good game.i enjoid it and for the game makers thankyou fo making the game. :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A very good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Welcome back to CoD !  Spoiler: samegame v2.  Newsflash: MP spawns are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.  GLHFLOL
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TBH I am enjoying this so far.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call Of Duty Ghosts is a good little step up from Black Ops II, the maps are a bit more out there and open. I Really do enjoy playing on call of duty ghosts.  The weapons are pretty cool, with some really good attachment to go with them it brings a feel of a new and old call of duty to the game.  i would recomend people to play call of duty ghosts. its beginner and expert and anyone in between friendly. Its also easy to play and to get use to. i give this a 9 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts is a great game, but the game is not perfectly designed for pc gameplay. Campaign is pure awesome, but the multiplayer needs some improvement. I would recommend this games who can tolarate repeative crashes because that is what takes the fun out of the game. I wouldn't say that $60 is worth this game so i recommend buying the game when it's on sale. Crashes is a major problem and lag is present between missions, but everything is fine during missions."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game but bad system requirements with dull graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really fun great gameplay and really worth the price COD: Ghosts is one of the best first person shoter i have ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes I love this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A vary fun game to play with friends.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Realy recrommend to gamers that love slow pack action but still has bad graphics but still love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this cod but only because i started playing the newer cods when they came out. if u are new to cod this game is awesome unlees u dont have the specs but if u are a older cod gamer just stick with the older cods
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game in general. Played my 3rd game and got a K.E.M strike. Went 18 and 0. Needs more people!!!! No more hackers/Modders trying to rank/derank you. TDM works like a Charm. It's all regular. I only wish that the people came back to enjoy it now. I have i5 650, ATI 5850 HD, 10gb RAM and can play medium on 60-70fps Buy this game from â™¥â™¥â™¥ for $10. We need more people to play with. 1,000 players seems okay but needs more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the new concepts. I read negative reviews about the levelling system and use of squad points. One review said, 'yeah, it may cater to people who value their time- but I did not have that gotta play one more map feeling. ' I worried about this, but now I realize it was a good. Having a good time playing it, like picking up all the weps and trying them out, then choosing to get it at any level, and trick it out just like I want it.. coz.. this aint my first rodeo. Recommend"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good for defensive way playstyle
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game mode it's good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very good but want dlc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is a really good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a really good game has a few problems but it is still good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a really kewl game i enjoyed playing it all tho i am hoping destiny will come to pc cuz i hear its like titan fall and cod and world of warcraft combined!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i give this game a 6/10 it could be better but overall i enjoyed it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Game For COD games Its Really Give us New Gameplay mod New things thx for Call of duty ^^
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the one with the dog!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a must have title, I personally think black ops 2 and pretty much most previous CoDs were far better than Ghosts. Although Ghosts is a somewhat decent game, there is a lack of support on the PC side of things. Sometimes you will get into hacked lobbies, no FOV slider, poor optimization, and just a lack of fixed makes this game a pretty bad port. If you have a console too and are debating on which platform to get Ghosts on go with your console, but if you only play PC and still want to experience CoD, there is a FOV mod out there which I'm almost positive won't get you banned and if you lower some settings or have some pretty decent hardware the game still runs fluidly. So in all, it's not a must have addicting game, but generally not too bad either. The campaign was very good as well. It took me 6 hours to complete, but if you're better than I am you can probably finish in 4. I wouldn't want to replay the campaign but it was still a fun experience, a few story line aspects fall just short though. In all the PC/Steam version of this game is a 7/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,biggest pice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ive ever played in my life never buy it does not even work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Such shooter, so amaze. Wow!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"im only going to say things about the campain on this line. i didn't like it because it was like 1 long scene, and it was short for a fully priced game and BORING!!!!  but this game has 1 of the best multiplayer gamemode in the world of 2013 and a alien gamemode that i have to love and hate at the same time  so i have to rate this diffrently campain: 18/100 multiplayer: 89/100 extinction: 50/100 squads: 55/100"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Updated Review: Re-written 05/07/16   Call of Duty: Ghosts is a great Call of Duty! One of the best Call of Duties ever made!  This game was judged too early before anyone gave it a chance to work out the bugs and kinks. If you are a fan of the Modern Warfare franchise, you'll also be a huge fan of Call of Duty: Ghosts!  The Call of Duty: Ghosts online community is still alive and kicking, and what's cool is there's no Exo Suits, the character customization isn't shiny and absurd-looking, and every gun in the game exists in real life (except for the Ripper and the Maverick). This game maintains much of the realism of a Modern Warfare, but with a subtle hint of the realistic futuristic warfare. It's perfectly balanced in both gameplay and art-form my opinion, as the fantasy and futurism is at a minimal.  I bought this game originally in November of 2013 and didn't like it, mainly because the game was brand new, laggy, un-optimized and full of bugs, so I put it on the shelf in my Steam Library and let it collect dust in disappointment for years up until now. I've developed such a craving to play a new Modern Warfare lately, so I decided to start re-playing MW3 at the start of 2016 (First time playing on PC, orginally played on Xbox in 2011) and prestiged 3 times. I started to get somewhat bored of MW3 again after couple of months of grinding and experimenting in multiplayer. My craving to play a new Modern Warfare had not subsided even after playing MW3 so much, so I decided to give Call of Duty: Ghosts another shot on April 1st of 2016.  What I've found is that both the Multiplayer PvP and the very fascinating Co-Op Extinction Mode (Like Zombie Mode, but with Aliens, and way better in my opinion!) are still full of people who play everyday! I've found that the game is better optimized and isn't laggy like it used to be, the weapon handling for almost all of the weapons is excellent, the perks and weapons are numerous, interesting, easy to unlock and very balanced, the maps are incredibly detailed, balanced and not too small, the killstreaks are fun, and the character customization is comprised mostly of realistic and tasteful options.   I'm completely addicted. I now play this game every single day. I almost regretted not playing it sooner, but I remembered that in November of 2013 I was busy playing Rust with my friends. I feel like I got to let the game optimize and balance itself over the years, and now in comparison to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Black Ops III, this game really truly blows them both out of the water.  Play this game. Give it another chance!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It nice
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how cani use paysafe?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can't even play this game. Runs fine in the game, but after about 10 minutes it crashes my whole pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game but I find it is laggyer then outher cods 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The guy that played CS 1.6 and CoD 4 this is a decent game... If you want 'somekind' of good old CoD this is a game for you.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is fun to play like all the other cod games and i have played almost all from mw2 and up so this game is one that i recomend because that i dont have any fps drop or other bug that gives it a negative experience and im a loyal fan of the cod series that i have been playing for a long time so thumbs up for Ghost and the cod series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game in general. Played my 3rd game and got a K.E.M strike. Went 18 and 0. Needs more people!!!! No more hackers/Modders trying to rank/derank you. TDM works like a Charm.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game 10/10 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"YES!!!, Best Game I ever played. Best Grafics, amazing maps,awesome weapons. I only would wish for the developers to add more interactive/distructive areas in maps, like in BF4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its pretty fun but you will get killed by bs things :).
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a good game not the best cod but still good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,need South Africa put on the list plz
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game , has a fun campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD revolution -=- FPS - best graphics.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,boss
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, awesome singleplayer, lovely multiplayer I love this game but there is some stuff that is bad, the singleplayer ending was very bad i dont know if in advanced warfare singeplayer its continuing from ghosts i hope so. Very easy to die and very easy to kill but killing is a little harder. i like this game its fun but you get killed when you dont expect it... Alot  I like this game i think you should buy it :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really good and I recommend it. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best CODs. Despite what others say. This game is awesome. Multiplayer and DLCs are great too.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best cod for my xD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game , great job with the graphics , just need better Vac system !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,thinking about what if ghosts really exist!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghost? The ghost squad dressed in federation squads in multiplayer  Disguise simulator 12/7
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want FPS Shooter game with good story this is the game,but the multiplayer its very bad,because have SO MANNY Hackers !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought this, installed it,Play more more more :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very fun and addicted
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought astronaut character but its not in my game and they wont refund my money and now I cant buy it again. so I got ripped off. If they here me please fix it. cant call directly.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is fun, not mush bad to say about it, definately good. Really like the whole Axtinction mode"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Whilst the game isn't amazing, it's certainly a good game. Not worth more than $60, and it has bad issues with cards and systems with less than 1.5GB of VRAM and 6GB of system RAM. Optimization wise the game sucks but otherwise it's worth the purchase if you've been a fan of the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just want to start by saying that I would only recommend this game to some one tired of the normall COD formula. This game tries to break out form the other CODS some what sucsessfully. The single player story is ok..not the best I have seen but what call of duty game has much of a story other then go here and kill every one in your way. It lets you play the game from diffrent point of view durring the same mission, such as on foot then suddenly in a helicopter, or on foot then your controlling a dog. As far a multiplayer is concerned more then likly dead see how there is another COD game out now and every one is playing it. Hope this helps a little."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can't even play this game. Runs fine in the game, but after about 10 minutes it crashes my whole pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,thinking about what if ghosts really exist!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"cool game ,similar to advanced warfare"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how cani use paysafe?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game 9 out of 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes I love this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It nice
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It dose not work how do I get a refund  Update 2015 March 30  Finally got it to work in full campaigns a little lagy with the steam over lay on would recommend seting prioaty to normal or above normal on campaign. but good stroy I will not give spoilers anout the campaign's story.  Multiplayer is fun but hard to get used to i am level 22 and i am just starting to find my triger finger but its really adictive i played last night untill ii could not aim strate.  love it good game fun to play 9/10 partly becuse of the problems i had would recommend a disk still uses steam.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really fun great gameplay and really worth the price COD: Ghosts is one of the best first person shoter i have ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Storyline : Amazing ! MP : Not that much ! Fell sorry for the community though ..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghost? The ghost squad dressed in federation squads in multiplayer  Disguise simulator 12/7
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want FPS Shooter game with good story this is the game,but the multiplayer its very bad,because have SO MANNY Hackers !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best cod for my xD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best CODs. Despite what others say. This game is awesome. Multiplayer and DLCs are great too.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game in general. Played my 3rd game and got a K.E.M strike. Went 18 and 0. Needs more people!!!! No more hackers/Modders trying to rank/derank you. TDM works like a Charm. It's all regular. I only wish that the people came back to enjoy it now. I have i5 650, ATI 5850 HD, 10gb RAM and can play medium on 60-70fps Buy this game from â™¥â™¥â™¥ for $10. We need more people to play with. 1,000 players seems okay but needs more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Y's it called gostes ur not even ded 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good for defensive way playstyle
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game mode it's good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very good but want dlc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In the beginning, I didnt. Now that there is a lot less lag you can actually snipe pretty well with a pistol. I'd give it a 7/10 at best."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a really good game has a few problems but it is still good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love the Guns in this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best Call of Duty ever, and best first person shooter ever made. 10/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its cod come play!!!!!!!!!!! lol
Call of Duty: Ghosts,tight
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a must have title, I personally think black ops 2 and pretty much most previous CoDs were far better than Ghosts. Although Ghosts is a somewhat decent game, there is a lack of support on the PC side of things. Sometimes you will get into hacked lobbies, no FOV slider, poor optimization, and just a lack of fixed makes this game a pretty bad port. If you have a console too and are debating on which platform to get Ghosts on go with your console, but if you only play PC and still want to experience CoD, there is a FOV mod out there which I'm almost positive won't get you banned and if you lower some settings or have some pretty decent hardware the game still runs fluidly. So in all, it's not a must have addicting game, but generally not too bad either. The campaign was very good as well. It took me 6 hours to complete, but if you're better than I am you can probably finish in 4. I wouldn't want to replay the campaign but it was still a fun experience, a few story line aspects fall just short though. In all the PC/Steam version of this game is a 7/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very good but want dlc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Used a FOV changer Got banned  My friend used speedhack and a modd-menu nothing happens  10/10 would play again if i was able to
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This dank game was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ surprise for CoD gaemerz (mostly kids) 9,69/2/10/52"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,recommend yes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are way too big and too much extra crap going on. Squad member setup is kind of pain. Still a good game, though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Was bad at release, has since been improved. If you tried it out earlier and didn't like it, I'd give it another go. 7.5/10 so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Snoop DogeÂ®/10 Would play again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,11/10 Would be attacked by men out of sand again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty: Ghosts is by all means a great game with nice graphics and game play. I'm a aging gamer chick and only played 4 hours so far but I know a great game when I play one. For those who haven't played this game is totally missing out on a awesome game. I highly recommend Call of Duty: Ghosts.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Some bad failings aside this is the most innovative CoD game in years. If you're rating this game on singleplayer, you're a joke. The amount of players getting CoD or BF games for single player at this point is so small it's not even worth measuring.  With the major changes to the class system to contextual changes to objects in the environment over to the characters calling out enemy positions this game is just a lot of fun. Weapons feel a little more balanced compared to Blops 2 and MW3. Assault rifles feel a lot more on par with SMGs.  Lag compensation still needs to go and continuing to take choice away from players (no filters on matchmaking at all) are both frustrating."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,An awesome FPS game for those who are new to the Call Of Duty franchise....highly recomend it if u can get used to a few annoying issues such as the random framerate drops and stuttering audio for load scenes. Story is very good in my opinion with a very interesting ending. The graphics are on par in this day and age but nothing outstanding here. Will buy the sequel if it does come out :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game. Have played it lots and you recommend it to most people.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game But people die so quick
Call of Duty: Ghosts,11/10 Would be attacked by men out of sand again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's cod.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love it, I don't know why people are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on it but it needs more players ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game in history! dont waste your money on this pce of crap!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Iâ€™ve been hearing so many bad things about this title that it took me several years to finally beat the single player campaign. Well, thatâ€™s not the only reason. Another was my old PC not being able to handle this poorly (?) optimized CoD iteration well.  What do I think now that I finished it? Itâ€™s short. 5-6 hours on Regular difficulty is *really* short. Some levels are almost ridiculously short. The audio stutters in cut scenes / loading screens and there seems to be no way around it. The story overall is quite flat. However, deeper through the game I found it moderately enjoyable. I think stating itâ€™s a bad title is a huge overstatement. Sure itâ€™s nothing extraordinary, definitely far from Modern Warfare but I still think itâ€™s worth playing. I especially enjoyed the second half of the story as well as the ending. 6/10"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game needs a sequel.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great cinematic shooter with amazing story! The campaign was much better than BF4 as for me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,epic game i love it :) good graphics good story good gameplay I just love this good game amazing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,In my opinion Call of Duty: Ghosts is one of the best Call of Dutys I've ever played in my whole life. There are just a few little things I would improve. But I think every Call of Duty is burdened by these issues. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fair shooter but to expensive. Infinityward is lost into details. Absence of innovation.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want to waste your money for something good, then don't buy cod ghosts....it's just classic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"listen, i think this is a great game, and all of you saying that it runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i get 120 fps on mutliplayer so ya, if you have a good pc, id sugest you get this game   Mt Rig: Processorr: AMD-FX 8350 8 core  Video Card: GeForce GTX 780 RAM: 8Gb"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Would be great if they would do something about all of the hackers. If not I won't be buying anymore of their products in the future.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you like getting victimized by cheaters ans hackers you'll love this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing now! menu lag fixed and properly optimised!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is good, but(!!!!), the PC version is not optimized. Console version is strongly recommended for better gameplay expirience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a fan of all COD games by Infinity Ward. This is a review for the single player campaign. A lot of people complain about a short campaign, and its not long. If all i did was review on time it took to beat then it wouldnt get high scores but this is based on the story. I enjoyed the story esp the 'Space station' scenes. It had great tempo to the story and was easy enough to follow. Sometimes these types of game look great on paper but once your adrenaline gets pumping you forget what the point of the story was. The Ghost series has plenty of depth to take them into the next decade of storytelling."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Picked up this game last week and i was really sceptic about it in the first place because of the bad reviews. I played the singleplayer, multiplayer, squads and ofcourse the new alien mode and I must say its really fun to play. I dont have any problems with this game. it looks great and I have no fps drops or such. I really like the storymode of this cod it brings back some good memmories from the modernwarfare series which is a good thing. The multiplayer maps are more balanced in my opinion. overal its a good call of duty not the best but definitely not the worst. hope they will fix some bugs and stuff to make it even better :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not bad.Can't understand why is everyone saying ' it is bad','waste of money' or something.It is pretty fun and Im glad I bought it.A little bit hard to play when you go into the multiplayer right up.The singleplayer is pretty interesting,good ending gotta say. I would recommend you buying it,but only on sale. I would rate this 8/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I haven't enjoyed a Call of Duty game this much since Modern Warfare 2. BO, MW3 and BO2 never really spoke to me, but this fits my needs in a FPS-game. It takes something to run it, but it's great when you can.   The singleplayer experience is, like with all other CoDs, magnificent (Y) I don't really play anything else than Search and Rescue in Multiplayer, because the spawnsystem in the more chaotic modes are a biiiit weird, but it's rather enjoyable.  All in all: 8/10 from a Modern Warfare/Modern Warfare 2 fanboy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sucks the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't forget the Riley
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"good game,but not long"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the only reason i am rating this recommended is because if u get bored this the game to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"updated version of the same old same old we see every year, some to love and some to hate.  the game took a step up in flued motion yet a stage down at all of its roots. knifing have an exacution animation making it both more worthy but slower."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Minus the unchecked hacking, minus the prestige hacking, minus the times of unplayable lag, minus the unreasonable time it takes to get a game, (You can get a game in MW2 faster than you can this one at times) it's a pretty good game. But it really appears to be dead and only two months old."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Game is simply amazing,   Campaign   To begin the campaign is deep and meaningful, with a clever simple and realistic storyline. The way that the space combat works is so good, This game allows guns to be fired in space and under the water, No other shooter does this (In the campaign) The way that Physics is broken is next gen. Also the story is full of emotion, when the black guys dies it feels good, but when the doge gets shot it is so Heartbreaking. As you take him to the Helo you feel very emtional as you look at the hair effects the have been copied from tomb raider so excellently with this piece of next gen gameplay. The story is very long and the missions are not very linear. For example on the first mission you will not die if you stop for 30 seconds to look at the amazing next gen graphics. This game runs on doge engine V1, which is a big step forward for the franchaise. Finally at the end the crushed americans get thousands of men, boats, planes, and a space shuttle full of broken men with broken guns to fight more men with broken guns. America always wins....  Multiplayer   Now as many of you know this game is played for its multiplayer, which has no faults whatsoever. For players with less than 4g of ram, the latest patch runs perfectly. Also the new unlock system removes no aspects of everything and the amazing new create a soldier mechanic lets the 'amazing' AI get to work. This game differs from MW3 is 657 ways, The weapons have changed name and now it takes less bullets to kill you. Two bullets will normally do the trick, which adds to gameplay and the ablity to look at the killcam alot. You will enjoy the maps to the highest possible level they use all of the best inspirtation, this game competes with bf4 very well, with the new 'tactical' waiting tactic. Also the way in which all of the good inspirtational maps from the campaign are not even used at all make it amazing. Why would players want space battles or underwater on Multiplayer? Who would even ask such a bad question? Now moving on the guns, the ammount of detail and improvement options and leveling that has gone into these weapons is amazing, the guns all have the wrong name and the ones with the right name behave very realistically. The snipers in this game are utterally amazing, Just amazing. The way that the detailed scope shows the gun in new detail and how your eyes stay in you head and dont melt is just next gen. Bullet drop is sniper rifles is totally removed allowing more gameplay and less tactics. The killstreaks i cannot comment on since i see to much of the killcam for them. Finally i will say how good the servers and community are. The players that you meet on call of duty are the sort of people that you want to play more games with. 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ camper noob' Is a very friendly example of what the communities best players say. Also the 'dedicated servers' allow for continued play. I have to mention though how much the grapics have improved in the multiplayer since BLOPS2 it is simply amazing the way the the next gen logs fall over and the next gen gates close is so next gen tbh. Also the fire and maps are beautiful they make you want to pay another Â£35 right away for the season pass with some more amazing next gen action.   Verdict and Conclusion  To conclude Call of Doge : Ghosts is an amazing game, possibly the 'best' FPS of all time, I agree with IGN on that part, But for people that like amazing, fun, and deep campaign action its good. Not to metion the 'massively upgraded multiplayer to this game for people that like going 500000 - 0, or spending their life in killcam this is the buy for you  Rating   I would personally rate this game  10/10 - Would Bang  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game i really do not know why people are saying so many bad things about the game. The problem is that alot of people do not understand that you need a new graphics card for this next Gen game. They made the graphics high so it looks good. So all that fps problems is because your computer can not run it so you need to get a new computer or update the stuff that is in it. I have a GTX 770 and it works fine i have no fps problems or nore game lag. I can play a hole match without one lag. The only problem i have is the home screen, that gives me a bit of lag but not a lot. I hope you can stop giving this game bad reviews because your computer can not run it. Please just go buy a better computer or componets than try the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do like the graphics and general gameplay of Ghosts, especially the single player. If you liked the other CoD games then you'll like this. The levels are fun to play and keep the general action theme to them.  You get to run around in tanks and helicopters and even control the loki satelite at the end to blow lots of stuff up. If you like action it won't let you down, although the story takes an odd dive here and there but its just trying to set it up for the next one. I don't know if I'll be as hyped about Ghosts II.  Though as always its let down by its lag in the PvP multiplayer. With no proper dedicated servers you end up with hosts disconnecting, lag and dying a lot from enemies you don't even see until the killcam shows you they stabbed you in the face.  The idea behind the Co-Op multiplayer is very nice with the alien infestation and the survival mode. It gets very tricky and a good team is needed to see the levels through to the end. If you don't know people to play with and make your own team it can be very frustrating with people disconnecting or not doing what they are supposed to, to complete challenges to complete achievements or just to make it through to the end.  I'll be very blunt... it isn't worth the money I paid for it for the enjoyment. I'd recommend waiting till it goes on sale but knowing CoD games they never get discounted much."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hey guys, I have never written a review for a game, but I have also never been so inclined to warn fellow gamers about a game. This game in many ways is a waste of money and I will tell you why. Multiplayer is littered with cheaters and when I say cheaters I mean flat out, totally obvious, aim bot and wall hacks galore.   Single player is fun, typical COD story line, multiplayer is no good until they patch hacks, clan wars seemed awesome until you realize that there is no web interface and the only way you can utilize the clan wars feature is through a mobile app. The only thing that has saved this game for me is the Extinction mode, which is fun to play with some friends. But there is only one level and it looks like a new level will come out for extinction with ever round of DLC, which means three or four more DLC's at 14.99, which would bring this game to a total cost of $60 + (4 x $15) = $120.   I can tell you right now, it is not worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"another call of duty that is hacked,  Q. why cant infinity ward and steam get this sorted? A. simple they take your money and dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the people that do not hack"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fix the spwans
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I had to wear pants during this 2/10 this also didn't make me mosit
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Decent game. Not much difference to the other CoD's. People are expecting too much from this game when it's a CoD game. Turn down your textures and graphics then its playable.  Again, stop expecting so much from a CoD game! I understand why you guys are un happy with it just pull through."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Multiplayer No Lags unless its a bad host. Single Player is rather short, took me about 5-6 hours to finish it. This game does not Lag on the Multiplayer as most people would complaint most likely due to bad computers i guess. but i get really Great smooth graphics on the multiplayer games. Big Thumbs up on this Game =D."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is basically the only interesting thing on this game. The multiplayer is pretty messed up. Graphics are messy and the game plays not as great compared to previous ones. This was a huge disappointment as a fan of Cod Series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but is you liked black ops 2 then you might like it but really i got it because my friend has it but if you want the bugs the mass lag and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ servers then this is the game for you. The only thing i liked was the sniper its new i liked it in rising storm only thing that made me like it but thats just me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all camppers and weapons sucks i say you should bought battlefield 4 than this crap game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hells ya i'd recommend the new cod to anyone great gameplay love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Be real. And play with Honor.No cheating.Your only hurting yourself when you cheat. ..Love My Country..Support our Troops..God Bless the USA....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I had to wear pants during this 2/10 this also didn't make me mosit
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's call of duty.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the best COD game yet just buy it and play till you drop. GHOST.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can play battlefield 4 on all ultra settings, but my computer can't even handle this game on the lowest graphics settings. This game is runs so poorly even the menu freezes randomly for no apparent reason. The patch fixed none of the graphical problems and Inifnity Ward seems to not even care. The sad part is, without the graphics and lag problems, I think this would be my favorite CoD yet."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I saw all the negative reviews about the graphics, but they are all wrong. I am guessing the negative reviews must be on older hardware. I am running the game as high as it will run and at 1920X1080 at 144hz. The graphics are exellent. There is no studder it is very smooth and the game looks awesome. The missions seem shorter that BF 4 but so far I very much enjoy the game. I have not had it crash once. I read the recomended requirements for the game and they are focused on a fairly serious gaming system. I have not tried multi-player yet so I can not comment there."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do recomend this game, bechause compared to all the other Call Of Duty's it is awesome! The Game has issues, but all in all the gameplay is good. I get the Modern Warfare 2 and Call Of Duty 4 feeling, and that is positive. It has frame-rate issues, but Nvidia and i think Amd will fix this. It was the same with Battlefield 4, but COD/Activision does not have betas witch is sad... And what realy is good about this game is the graphics.  Summing up: +Graphics +Gameplay +Weapon balance +Extinction mode +Create-a-class system +Ground war  -Big maps (Really not a problem in ground-war) -Frame-rate issues!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is pretty f'ing awful
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Game ever still didint try it xD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best of COD series :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,That's Best game i'v plyed and Nice story So you can try it...

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Only good thing about this game is the Alien mode. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First impressions were I wanted a refund because I couldn't get the game to run with out lagging so bad I would rage quit. However, after REMOVING old video drivers and installing the newest, then setting the game to run at normal priority I habve played many hours lag free and at the highest settings. My computer is not a late and great. I have an AMD 6 core at 3.0 Mhz and 2 HD-6850's and 6 Gigs ram on Win 7 x64. Not to much above minimum specs.  The Game: SP - I only have a few hours logged in SP but so far the story line is IMHO pretty decent. I have had no bugs (others have reported bugs) and the missions have gone smoothly other than my own mistakes.   MP - Maps are a variety of CQB and large sniper maps. Have not seen nearly as many hackers as others have been complaining about, but I have seen less than a handful. I am enjoying the maps. I however wish that dedicated servers would be in the next patch, but I doubt we will ever get them.  Kits - Soldier and kit building is far superior to previous titles allowing for full customization of your soldier. The ability to create multiple soldiers and level them up for squad play is interesting and something I am just now starting.  Graphics  Meh. When at full settings the graphics are decent but not worthy of next-gen branding. Destruct ible enviroments could be described as a very few destructible objects. BF3 even had almost full destructable environments (buildings, etc.) Do not expect this in Ghosts. For a 'next-gen' game I expected more, way more...  I'ld give this game 7/10. The gampeplay for me is pretty damn good, but the graphics should be way better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best of COD series :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign:  Such Dog, Much Kill, So Cray, Very Good!  Multiplayer:  Such Hacks, Much Hackers, So Many Hackers, To Many Hackers, HACKERS!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Everyone is complaining about this game. I was too in the beginning, but you need to get used to this COD. I did, and I love playing it currently."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sometimes the multiplayer makes me want to rage and throw my computer out the window, but for the most part its amazing!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For me, the game is fine. It's fun and challenging. What's wrong is Steam and the sorry environment they've stuck us with to play it. There are so many blatant hackers, it amazes me. I'm reporting someone after almost every round. It's by far the worst gaming environment I've played in for many years. Does Steam ever really do something about hackers? I see people I've reported, who already have Bans on record! What kind of ban is it when they're playing with bans on record? If someone cheats in a multi player game on steam, then they should be banned from all multiplayer games for at least a year. First offense. If they are caught cheating after that, it should be a ban for life on all multiplayer games. If Steam can't show the honest players who've spent good money on their product, enough respect to provide us with a hacker free environment to play in, they should at least give us an option like 'Vote kick'. That way the players can control the cheating and the greedy pukes at Steam can keep on counting their money and ignoring us. Its really too bad their isn't any competition out there for this kind of Game. Battlefield doesn't cut it for me. But I'd sure dump steam and COD if there was a viable option."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The newest entry in the Infinity Ward Call of Duty series takes a big step forward from their last entry, MW3. The single player campaign is one of the best in recent memory, telling a brand-new, interesting story about a outnumbered, outgunned, and invaded America. It also shows of some epic setpiece moments. Plus, you get to play as a dog! How awesome is that?  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I actully really like this game. I get a solid performence from my PC with no bugs or crashes..I dont know what you guys are experiencing...But on my pc, this game is Perfect. Easily one of the best games ive played this year."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Underrated game, If it wouldnt been for earlier Call of Duty games/ that these games does'nt come out every year I think it would be a 10/10 game or maybe a strong 9/10. So especially for you that haven't played a Call of Duty game before, PLAY THIS. And those who have played one/more of the older COD games, I understand you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,apart from the hackers in multiplayer its a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nerf the strenghth of the guns and It will be a playable game and get some smaller map DLCs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,most AWESOME CALL OF DUTY EVER totaly buy iy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, a little glitchy and FILLED with hackers, but i love what they did with Call of duty. Everyone should get this "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when dedicated servers coming :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is absolutely fantastic. The Campaign had a great story and it had a great ending. Extinction is lots of fun and I definetly recommend it. The Multiplayer is fun and so is the character customization. At first it performed badly but thanks to the nvidea control panel everything was under control and it still runs smoothly. If you want story, fun and action, get this game. Can't wait for Call of Duty: Ghosts 2. (As the ending of the Campaign clearly suggests it.)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"O dear ! This version of COD has really let pc gamers down ,AGAIN!!!! Game play on the multiplayer has been a nightmare,glitches,freeze ups, stuttering graphics to name but a few, but the most disapointing aspect of all is the total lack of dedicated servers.Much was promised by the developers reguarding server but nothing has happened,yet again.How many times are we going to fall for this load of crap,they promise dedi servers to lure the gamers and clans in,take your money then let you down again.Well this is the last time for me and my members it will not happen again!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've owned the game since release day and have yet to experience a single crash or bug. The game runs smoothly at 60 FPS with all settings at high / ultra in both single player and multiplayer.  The single player campaign, though short, goes a long way towards putting you into the feel of a special operations team member with missions ranging from underwater combat to base infiltration to space combat. While the story itself is fairly straightfoward and reminiscint of a hollywood summer action flick, it's still enjoyable.  The multiplayer is where the game stands out compared to previous call of duty titles. The level designs are larger and much more complete in terms of accessibility and realism of buildings as well as other objects. Firing through cracks in objects will not cause bullet collision with invisible walls which is quite nice. Another major bonus is the removal of a large portion of the aerial kill streak rewards, bringing the fight back down to a groundwar rather than constant map bombardments by overpowered rewards.  The people who are complaining about the performance of this game are putting on display a fault of their own machine hardware rather than a fault with the game itself. Because this game was designed for so-called 'next generation' hardware, it is odd to expect it to still run smoothly on outdated setups.   While the game is not extreme in it's innovations within multiplayer, the addition of more movement possibilities such as sliding and vaulting allows for a deeper level of immersion as the usual bunny hop and run and gun mentality which is too often seen in CoD titles has been all but eliminated. In it's place are players willing to take a more serious tactical approach to gun combat. While this does lead to a slower pace in matches, it also adds a better sense of realism and immersion which is seriously lacking in previous Call of Duty titles."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the best games I've ever played hates gonna hate,I really like the dlcs they're fun intense Espically Aliens can't calm down for a second there! Looking forward for all upcoming dlcs though there are a few hackers and lags other than that this game is amazing =)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THis game is awesome

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is a tricky one to sum up. The guns feel great with a few feeling a little sluggish and op. The campaign is a little generic with a few parts being boring and the other few being quite enjoyable.   The new squads mode is always a treat to play, your either against an AI squad of someone else's or your up against someones squad with the creator of the squad in the game.  Extinction mode is what you would expect from an alien survival gamemode; try not to get killed by the aliens and protect a certain objective, simple.  In short Call Of Duty: Ghosts is not a bad game, but its also not the best game in its franchise, Ghosts does not deserve a massive amount of hype, but it also doesnt deserve a massive amount of hate."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Decent game... BUT PLAYER BASE...  Let me tell you this... If you thinking to buy this game for multiplayer... (Single Player is garbage in this one) Prepare yourself to get killed tons off times by campers...  Game is full off camping â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...  I played only over 9 hours at this point... and i already can easily make max prestige kids rage quit and call me cheater...  Listen 'DUDE' ! If you grind up your level to max prestige by camping in the corner with termal optics... And some rusher used to fast paced COD and has better aim (obvously because of CSGO) destroys your fat â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the game you alegedly 'MASTERED'.... My friend YOU SUCK BIG TIME!  Tonight i got reported i think 8 times... Was called cheater by max prestige players like 3 times... All i can say. Stop sitting in the corner and get good KID!  I don't see the point spending money when you are not going to play... Instead you lay down in the corner have a cheeseburger in one hand mouse in another and then get ready to get SALTY!   GET OWND SON!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,lovely game in my life 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You have a here a very good multiplayer mode for Lan Party Games!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I personally like Call of Duty: Ghosts, People complain about hackers but I have actually only seen one or two in the 90 hours I have logged. Definately worth buying in my opinion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love this game but cant wait for the next instalment
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Classic COD Game with Strikzone map 24/7 available ! The best Multiplayer game i ever played and really addicted to it . First i played it on a ps4 and then on my high-end gaming pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is great if you can look past the multiple bugs, though IW should update their game more to fix several issues."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not the worst cod, but certainly not the best. Awesome campaign storyline, but cliffhanger ending that will never be answered. Multiplayer is kinda fun. Extinction is just stupid. Overall: 6/10 Becasue campaign is the best part. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best COD's i ever played.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the atmosphere of the game. Great campaign and multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very gud would meme again 420/69
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I tried to be the most MLG Swagmaster and Quicksc0pe all those fegs, but then i realised there's no Mtn' Dew and Doritos in Serbia. I got called a Russian and got Dr0pshottd to death."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice Game Must Have
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only bought it for the single player mode, and although very good indeed, I found it too short. 3-5 hours. It is heavily slanted to multiplayer. For multiplayer the price is fine, especially if bought in a sale, However for single player it is too expensive for my tastes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Decent game... BUT PLAYER BASE...  Let me tell you this... If you thinking to buy this game for multiplayer...

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This geme r â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,That's a CoD game.  It runs well.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game computer version is a little low on people to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cause I love It!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is pretty decent, but if you don't have a decent graphics card, with a decent cpu, and don't have 8gb ram or more, don't buy the is game, i recommend for you to have a 7770 2gb or a gtx 660 to play this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player its beautiful but i don't like the multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really good singleplayer. If you dont care for multiplayer its not as bad as everyone says it is.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cause I love It!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game isnt that bad. Infinity ward just need to get there crap together and fix all the dang hacks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same old COD with some tweaks here and there but I must admit that jungle and underwater maps are among the most visually impressive environments I have seen in any game so far! Single player campaign is very good and full of action in best of cod traditions!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Got no complains about this game or about steam for that matter, if there is something wrong like stuff ain't working like it should then it will not be on there end :-) Anyway i recomment this game to all that wanna try playing it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For a 62yo noobie this is quite an enjoyable game, but, I would still like to play as a single player instead of a team.  On some missions you play against a clock, don't like that, I want to explore my environment, the ppl who made the scenery should let players wander around, all that graphics, just to race past it.  Into the deep shows an under the sea experience, just like a coral reef, again, I would like to go exploring, but the games engine makes you die if you wander off course, stick with the team, I don't want too, I want to explore."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same call of duty style, just new feeling gun mechanics plus some new gameplay features! In all its just as fun as MW2 was in its hay day. 9/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game Better Then I Expected.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros:  - Graphics engine - No need to be a level 60 to have the good gear in MP - Fast gameplay - Good choice of weapons - Perk system is great  Cons:  - Bad servers, no dedi (this is dead I know but we can dream, all hail to cod4) - Wait times for loging into a game, can take up to 5 minutes to get enought people to play - Hackers heaven, they have to do something about it, it's a complete joke   Even if this game frustrates me I still recomend it, when and if you can get into a game without hackers it's pretty awsome. They did a good job with the new gametypes but what is it with the hardcore, why not put every gametype in there, I just hate wasting an entire clip on a guy to get him to die.They added Domination but they should add CTF and all those other cool gametypes.  Listen, I still play COD4 everyday, but Ghost ...not as much. Servers are a pain but this aint going to change anyday soon. This is the way they found to make money, no more modding, no more dedi servers, no more custom mapping. Do you still play BO ?? I don't , ne more new maps, people switched to Ghost. They are making ton's of money like that, 120$ if you get the map packs, that's a lot of money period."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am changing my mind about this game. I say this game is good and bad in different ways.  =========================MULTIPLAYER==========================================  I thought multiplayer was decent, though it is way too complicated with all of the 'soldiers' and all of that crap. I thought that the multiplayer was decent enough to give a 6.5 out of 10   ==========================================SINGLEPLAYER=======================  Single player has horrible graphics and poor gameplay. A horrable story with a cliff hanger at the end. What I really got mad at was the fact that at the end, they have a cliff hanger and they dont even make a second game to this one. Intsead they make advanced warfare and all of that crap. I made a bad decision pre-ordering this game. If you want to buy it, buy it for the multiplayer. Dont even install single player.    =================================IN ALL======================================   Multiplayer graphics: 8/10  Singleplayer Graphics: 2/10  Multiplayer Gameplay: 7/10  Singleplayer Gameplay: 4/10  In all: 6.5/10  And extinction is pretty cool, but I dont play it much. Extinction gets a 9/10 for me. Best part of the game for me :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Frankly, COD Ghost has one of the best single story of all COD games, however the multplay could be much better...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unlimited sprint? I'm in!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE BEST GAME EVAA
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not much has changed, not saying its bad.Real enjoyable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD ghosts is a really nice game. i have 4GB RAM and i can run it on high!!! this game hasn't caused me any problems so far, beautiful campaign and a very nice fast - paced ( although hard for me ) multiplayer experience. And for everyone that says this is unoptimized garbage BUY A BETTER PROSSECOR !!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty cool game enough said
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS SO ASEM YOU NEEEED TO BUY IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont know what people mean by this game has mouse lag. I think it great !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the Best game ever!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I see so many negative reviews about this game because of the system requirements needed to run it. The truth of the matter is this.... if your computer doesn't meet the minimum specifications to play this game then you shouldn't be buying it and should be saving up for a new computer. I have played through most of the single player campaign and found it runs perfectly on my gaming computer. I do not have some 3000$ computer... in fact I did not pay over 650 USD for the computer I have now. You could consider it a mid-level gaming computer. I do not run into lag spikes, or have a low frame rate. I can honestly say that I have no complaints about performance. I mostly play in extinction mode, but have tinkered in the other multiplayer modes. Extinction gets a 8/10 from me. It is unlike any other player vs AI experience that I have encountered in my ten years of PC gaming. I highly recommend this game to anyone who MEETS the minimum system requirements and highly reccomend those that DON'T MEET it either get a new computer or stop complaining about how it doesn't run well on your old/crappy/cheap computers.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's not that bad after all. Let's face the fact that you had your expectations way over head for that game, but coming out- it's delivered the most standard and satistfying COD experience as it could be. It's fun to shoot, fun to watch those action sequences, QTE is cool and just where it needs to be. I have played all COD games except for the 3'd one and I'm pretty sure that I didn't miss a thing on that one. This is a good Call of Duty game. Period."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty decent game, plays nicely and the campaign is not bad at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game! Fun campaign and story, and great multiplayer. Lots of fun multiplayer gamemodes to choose from, and cool new features"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Playing Call of Duty is awsome even after I play BF4 it is a game that i will always come back too.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is Cool, especially with the dog Riley."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome game, Russel would love it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A bit slow, too much control by the storyline and objectives,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I will always laugh at CoD and it's ways  *T-bags someone* *Field olders completed* *Throws carepackage*  *:o K.E.M strike*  lol. Although the this game has been given so much hate it's not a horribly unplayable game. Still not good though.   Single Player/Story mode is good but :3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think many of the negative reviews for this game on Steam are a little off kilter. The bottom like here is that this is an IW Call of Duty game. If you've played one in the past, you preeeety much know what you're getting into. If you've enjoyed their previous games, you'll likely enjoy this one too. It's nothing groundbreaking, but like a summer blockbuster, it has a few enjoyable set-pieces and the action is tight and satisfying as always. I for one had a lot of fun with the single player campaign, which is usually my main reason for getting these games. I experienced none of the bugs and glitches everyone else seemed to be complaining about, so either they've patched these up or it was never all that bad in the first place. My guess is a little of both.   So, bottom line, let the haters hate. If you like CoD, this will be right up your alley. Just don't pay full price, wait for the next Steam sale to pick it up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought ghosts like a month ago, activated it like 3 weeks ago, installed it yesterday, and gonna play it today inshallah. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is pretty decent, but if you don't have a decent graphics card, with a decent cpu, and don't have 8gb ram or more, don't buy the is game, i recommend for you to have a 7770 2gb or a gtx 660 to play this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player its beautiful but i don't like the multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is Lacking compared to Black ops 2, and Exinction is a mixed bag comapred to zombies, but the multiplayer is the best in the series so far. If you can get past the lack of FOV slider and some technical bugs you will enjoy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best call of duty games i have ever played. Infinity ward started the call of duty series and i am very happy that they also were able to bring it into the next generation of gaming. I was a fan of the term ghost(s) since mw2 and i used it to say that if you were a ghost you were the best of the best in warfare and stealth. Now there is a game called Ghosts i had to own it and i am glad i pre ordered it. I have been a CoD fan since MW and since then i got and played CoD 1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 waiting to get World at War and i wish CoD 3 would be on the PC so i can say i own the whole series. I cant wait to get and play WaW. please treyarch realease CoD 3 for pc. I cant wait to see what Treyarch does next and also i want to see what happens in the next game in the Ghost Arc. Call of Duty Forever lets get another 10 games.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've enjoyed it. Most reviews want this to be 'extraordinary' or 'next-gen', when in reality it's the same Call of Duty that you are used to.   Call of Duty hasn't changed all that much since Call of Duty 4, and I believe that because it doesn't change, it sells very well. Sort of like how everyone hated Halo: Reach, because it was 'different' from halo 3."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If it weren't for the usual CoD hackfest, this game would be the best ever. Damn cheaters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A bit slow, too much control by the storyline and objectives,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game most people dont like the new style but i give it a 10 out of 10 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a very fun game for all people that like the Call of Duty series. The only porblems are the hackers and the lag
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The bast game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game if you don't have a computer that can handle the graphic, ram and more. If you have it, BUY IT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are pretty big, and no ground war, there is alot of running around looking for campers, just to be shot by one and have to run back to the fray. Typical CoD, nothing special really. Probably the single most coolest thing is the Dog. But ya more of the same smg/shotty speed perks ruling the game. Can't really recommnend or not recmmend...so I'll say yes for now. Glad I got it on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think many of the negative reviews for this game on Steam are a little off kilter. The bottom like here is that this is an IW Call of Duty game.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is a good game buy it !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the game i think it is one of the best COD you have ever made ;D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"great game just too short and easy to complete, however this is a great game visually and playability, would recommend as the multiplayer is brilliant so worth buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't know why all the negative comments. Ghosts runs great on my machine. It's an AMD 8 core with ten gbt ram and a 2 ghz video card. Amazing story line. Much better than Battlefield 4.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game Better Then I Expected.

This is the way they found to make money, no more modding, no more dedi servers, no more custom mapping. Do you still play BO ?? I don't , ne more new maps, people switched to Ghost. They are making ton's of money like that, 120$ if you get the map packs, that's a lot of money period."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a great game with many facets of gameplay. The campaign is great and adventurous. The graphics of the game are epic. The Multiplayer is as usual with enemy players spawning behind opponents which is the same classic flaw in game design as always was in the Call of Duty series as well as the allowance of a multitude of hackers inserting their hack codes into the game without reproach. The Multiplayer as well is the usual Run and Gun Nadefest and air attack/hackfest as usual and to me is not enjoyable for honest players. However their is a breath of fresh air in the other venues of the game. Squad Assault and especially Wargame is great co-op gaming except the rotating game thing. I would think you could specify if you wanted t play a particular game such as Team Deathmatch as opposed to be unwillingly shifted from game mode to game mode and as well the long waiting for the idiotic server rotation which is not working for anybody I've talked to. Not to mention that Steam downloaded some kind of update for online play and everytime it updates your stats the game locks up and quits. Then you have to reboot again and go through the long waiting process to get into another server. They dropped the ball when they stopped the dedicated server option for this game. I like the game and I like the graphics but the above mentoned issues put a huge thorn into the side of a great game. SOK Fraggenstein said it. Spec Op Killers Elite  www.sok.spruz.com 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,better maps and gameplay than some of the other call of duty. i recommend this game purely for the thought that went into map design 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Frankly, COD Ghost has one of the best single story of all COD games, however the multplay could be much better...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unlimited sprint? I'm in!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best multiplayer ( any CoD ), stop lisening to haters and try it :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE BEST GAME EVAA
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game the people make it bad, people that play the game and get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in lobby and say it sucks and will never buy it again are liers theyll play it everyday and just make thems selfs look stupid no their not trying to be funny or moc people they are starting it and call people like me hackers for being good and them being sucky when i get 30-7 some times"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First of all, I'd like to thank Steam for adding the tag section. This allows people who haven't played the game, to make a review of it after watching a trailer.   Now onto the game. It has an OK story. Lackluster at points. Very fun at others. Kind of an enjoyable story. Then theres multiplayer. Multiplayer is suprisingly good this time. This is the first time I've played on PC only, compared to all other CoD's where I've played on console. The community is rather nice, and very competetive. Not full of 9 year olds like everyone says. A new addition, more of a zombies clone is Extinction. I haven't played much Extinction, but it is really fun. Different than zombies enough, but still feels like it.   Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It could of been 9, but bad pricing.  Buy it if you want or have the money. Worth more like 40 dollars, but still a very fun game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am changing my mind about this game. I say this game is good and bad in different ways.  =========================MULTIPLAYER==========================================  I thought multiplayer was decent, though it is way too complicated with all of the 'soldiers' and all of that crap. I thought that the multiplayer was decent enough to give a 6.5 out of 10   ==========================================SINGLEPLAYER=======================  Single player has horrible graphics and poor gameplay. A horrable story with a cliff hanger at the end. What I really got mad at was the fact that at the end, they have a cliff hanger and they dont even make a second game to this one. Intsead they make advanced warfare and all of that crap. I made a bad decision pre-ordering this game. If you want to buy it, buy it for the multiplayer. Dont even install single player.    =================================IN ALL======================================   Multiplayer graphics: 8/10  Singleplayer Graphics: 2/10  Multiplayer Gameplay: 7/10  Singleplayer Gameplay: 4/10  In all: 6.5/10  And extinction is pretty cool, but I dont play it much. Extinction gets a 9/10 for me. Best part of the game for me :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD ghosts is a really nice game. i have 4GB RAM and i can run it on high!!! this game hasn't caused me any problems so far, beautiful campaign and a very nice fast - paced ( although hard for me ) multiplayer experience. And for everyone that says this is unoptimized garbage BUY A BETTER PROSSECOR !!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best Cod's ever Made but....To many noobs HAHAHAH!! XD 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont know what people mean by this game has mouse lag. I think it great !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS SO ASEM YOU NEEEED TO BUY IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really great game, love how we are able to customise both character and gun"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game carnt wait to see wats next
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crappiest game. Havent been able to connect to online servers /services at all
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty:Dogs is very interesting production,because a lot of campers(mainly from Germany or from Russia),ieds,dogs,great optymalization and rly good maps...Also this game has incredible connnection in Multiplayer mode!Definitely go to buy it and have a great butthurt :P"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is pretty decent, but if you don't have a decent graphics card, with a decent cpu, and don't have 8gb ram or more, don't buy the is game, i recommend for you to have a 7770 2gb or a gtx 660 to play this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player its beautiful but i don't like the multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought ghosts like a month ago, activated it like 3 weeks ago, installed it yesterday, and gonna play it today inshallah. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same call of duty style, just new feeling gun mechanics plus some new gameplay features! In all its just as fun as MW2 was in its hay day. 9/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the Best game ever!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"OMG! The tank controls for this game, are so good. So much fun I played that level like 5 times. &lt;3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,NO Theather -.- 4 out of 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If it weren't for the usual CoD hackfest, this game would be the best ever. Damn cheaters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is a really good CoD, but there's a lot of hackers. :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just another call of duty game. At this point we should know what to expect! 7/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are pretty big, and no ground war, there is alot of running around looking for campers, just to be shot by one and have to run back to the fray. Typical CoD, nothing special really. Probably the single most coolest thing is the Dog. But ya more of the same smg/shotty speed perks ruling the game. Can't really recommnend or not recmmend...so I'll say yes for now. Glad I got it on sale."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not much has changed, not saying its bad.Real enjoyable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game if you don't have a computer that can handle the graphic, ram and more. If you have it, BUY IT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't know why all the negative comments. Ghosts runs great on my machine. It's an AMD 8 core with ten gbt ram and a 2 ghz video card. Amazing story line. Much better than Battlefield 4.

They did a good job with the new gametypes but what is it with the hardcore, why not put every gametype in there, I just hate wasting an entire clip on a guy to get him to die.They added Domination but they should add CTF and all those other cool gametypes.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty: Ghosts is better than people say and I am having a lot of fun playing!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game! Recommending 4 everyone :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of duty Ghosts is the best cod yet
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yes Its a Good Game and lot easier to play thn previous COD series..Fav all time was Mw2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really Good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Try hards, campers, noobs.. Still fun ! haha"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've seen better CoDs but this one isn't that bad at all. I would rather go play some Modern Warfare but it's cool.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldnt â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on this game then feed it to my cat thats how bad it is

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Damn underrated great game except quite a few players and some thermal lmg campers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,could be better. thx anyways :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is for all the Call Of Duty fans out there. This game is one of the BEST FPS (First Person Shooter) games out there encluding Battlefield 4. The campgain is apsolutely awesome and maybe the best since COD 4 . The multiplayer is awesome as well with the add of the Squad feature. I can only hope you guys can own some faces and kill a lot of rorkes :P

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer - broken, but nice sniper mechanics  Aliens - not as good as zombies, but alot more in line with DOOM gameplay  Campaign - Only redeeming quality as it is the first CoD since MW that had a proper storyline and remains the only 1 to this day. If you can get the game for discounted price, the campaign really isn't bad. I ran it on medium with a GTS 450 and 4gb ram, so it is the only CoD with an overstated min requirement"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Make CoD Ghosts II
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't know whats with all the bad reviews. This game is great! Awesome graphics and gameplay. New guns and perk system. I love it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"good game,, not great multi monitor support though,,, u need something likw flawless widescreen to fix the streaching issues and hud,, but all in all good game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm going to admit that my kneejerk reaction to this game when it first came out was something less than positive. That being said, I gave it a few months, and I sat down and digested what occurred in the single player game itself. In addition, I took a closer look at how the game engine performs, and reached a few conclusions that weren't immediately apparent or obvious.  I'll start with the game engine and the graphics overhaul that Ghosts brought to the CoD franchise. A lot of people are complaining that the game doesn't run that well in terms of frame rate. The reason for this is because they've set their graphics settings way too high. The console version certainly doesn't run the game in 1080p at max settings. Personally, I set the resolution lower (1440x900) and the graphics settings to 'high' and the game runs a lot smoother (and looks much better) than it did at 1920x1200 with graphics at 'normal'. I'll post my PC build at the end of the review. Long story short, this game looks absolutely stunning at max graphics, but you need a top of the line video card with a lot of built-in RAM to run it well.  And now for the single player campaign. At first, like many other people, I was disappointed in how generic the story seemed, and with how absurd the plot was at times. Then I actually started looking into all of the cute things IW put into the game, and I came to the conclusion that IW actually did their homework. Without spoiling anything, those crazy satellites in the game actually exist, along with a majority of the hardware presented in the game, heartbeat monitor notwithstanding. The story, on the other hand... at first glance, it seems like IW just threw something together with no idea where it was heading. Looking back on it, after having seen the extra cutscene you get after you beat the game on veteran, and taking it into context with the backstory we were presented with.... all I can say is, 'Wow.' Assuming IW doesn't chicken out of the next logical step in terms of plot, the next installment in the series is going to *completely* change the way you look at games. Allow me to explain:   a large portion of the plot in single player is spent fighting the antagonist of the game, Rorke, who used to be a Ghost, himself. It is explained that he was *completely* devoted to fighting the Federation [the bad guys], but was captured, and vigorously tortured; he was tossed into a hole in the jungles of South America and fed food laced with various poisons. This completely destroyed him in every aspect, and when this was accomplished, the enemy (brainwashed) put him back together in their own image to go after the very people he used to work with. He also just so happens to do this extremely well. If you beat the game, you know that after the credits start to roll, you wind up back on the beach where the game ended, which promptly leads to Rorke showing up, beating the living daylights out of you, and dragging you off telling you that you're going to help him kill your friends. Now, the next bit only happens if you beat the game on veteran: there's an extra scene where you're the player again, and you're in a hole... in the middle of the jungle. So here's the kicker: IW may very well be leading up to a HUGE meta mind-@$%! showing you that *choice* in video games is an illusion, and you're forced to play the next installment fighting   for  the bad guys.  If IW manage to pull this off properly, well.... we'll see.    No, the game didn't add anything really substantial as far as innovation goes, but the graphics overhaul does make the game look very pretty. If you enjoyed the Modern Warfare series and its gameplay, you'll enjoy this game. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it entertaining? Yes. All in all, I feel that this game was deliberately generic because IW needed filler to properly setup the next game, which, if my guess is correct, should be  extremely  entertaining. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you've already played Modern Warfare 1, 2, and 3 and enjoyed them. If you haven't played those, go buy Modern Warfare and see what you think. If you enjoy it, move on up the ladder.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 way better than Battlefield 4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not bad but prefer the previous cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In my opinon, i believe that Ghost has to be considered to the Call fo Duty Games out there today. Graphics are clear, the actions are amazing but, i did however discover that some features of Ghost are similar to BattleField."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Follows the same formula as all Call of Duty games - tons of enemies, tons of guns, lots of cinematic action and set pieces in a huge variety of environments.  Ghosts really does a great job having you fight in jungles, underwater, on aircraft carriers, trains and even outer space. However, most of the campaign is repetitive - they just throw tons of enemies at you who stand behind cover and keep shooting at you like dumb AI. There is no intelligent AI like Last of Us which requires you to think - all you need to do is aim &amp; shoot.  Extinction is really fun though and is a great co-op mode. More games should have co-op modes, great fun to play with friends. Overall Ghosts is a decent Call of Duty game - overall pretty good but not the best."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is for the single player only.   So I've played this game to completion on the single player and whilst there is a lot wrong with this game I have to give them credit for the different story locations they bring to the table. It might be unrealistic in some parts and yes the tank level was horribly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in terms of realism of driving the tank compared to the likes of Battlefield 4 but I did actually enjoy the main story. Lots going on and lots to do. It may be a generic shooter but its a shooter I think needs to Focus more on the single player and ditch the multi player. I know it won't happen but the only reason I ever play COD is for the story and single player. I was actually suprised it was fairly long this time compared to the likes of battlefield 4's campaign.   Campaign only I give it a 6/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The best just keep on getting better, can't wait for the DLC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this Game Best Call Of Duty Game Yet That i have played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"At last, Ghosts seems to run smooth! Too little Too late though, as I would of brought the Season Pass when it first came out, not bothered now unless they reduce the price!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sick game, 9.5/10 no golden flying unicorns that you can ride"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, It's cod. What can you expect. If you can get past the frame drops and other problems it's a fun shooter, just like cod has always brought to the table. I'd reccomend this. And with the stability problems I'd like to point out that it's NOT steams fault. It's every pc version. Disc or download."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,in pc not good its crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,where's the info about the new gun 'the ripper'? the add says to check the store for more info. It must be encoded
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hell Yeah...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's good for a boys game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,they finally got this working pretty good online with the latest patch all in all i think its worth buying. online is fun! if you have this game or black ops 1 or 2 or mw3 feel free to ad me as a friend.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts is magnificent! Yea you might need to upgrade your video card but so what.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont care what other people think, i personally like this game. Its finally a call of duty thats different!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly don't understand why this game has so many negative reviews. This is by far the best game I've ever played. The graphics are phenomenal and the campaign is very action packed and exciting. The Extinction mode is very very fun and very fast paced and requires a lot of team work. I love Extinction it's great. The multiplayer is really fun too. I don't care much for some of the maps, but the DLC maps kick so much â™¥â™¥â™¥. The only thing that I don't like is that the only people that play this game are the die hard cod fans that are close to or are max prestige. But other than that I absolutely love this game, I am a huge fan and it was definitely worth all the money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a very good game i reccomend buying. time to kill aliens
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THis game is fun and its not full of hackers like black ops 2 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Epic campaign... I mean ONE HELL of a CAMPAIGN. And last but not least is the decent multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,could be better. thx anyways :)

Now I keep thinking, 'why's this guy from The Walking Dead a main character in this game?'... just idoitic.

In conclusion I won't regret that I've purshed this game good luck at the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good but laggy because of the bad port
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THis game is fun and its not full of hackers like black ops 2 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts is magnificent! Yea you might need to upgrade your video card but so what.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"At last, Ghosts seems to run smooth! Too little Too late though, as I would of brought the Season Pass when it first came out, not bothered now unless they reduce the price!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sick game, 9.5/10 no golden flying unicorns that you can ride"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,in pc not good its crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,where's the info about the new gun 'the ripper'? the add says to check the store for more info. It must be encoded
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I recommend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call me for inv in my clan or your`s clan will be good wanna play 2gether c:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, i would reccomend you buy it :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,online gameplay is laggy and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but overall the game is good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts gets a lot of bad press, most of it due to launch issues with lag. But bottom line is this is a GREAT game. The launch issues have been ironed out and: BEST graphics of any Call of Duty; BEST &amp; most realistic game play of ANY Call of Duty; Well balanced weapons; and decent maps. Especially the small and medium sized maps. If you can pick this game up on a Steam sale, I highly recommend it. Sincerely - Dr. X"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"hey people, give this game some time. for now, you will need a 'smoking' computer in order to enjoy the game, but even then i am aware of issues. If you would give IW some time, maybe they could solve these issues. ITS A BRAND NEW GAME! But onto gameplay and game quality, MP is great and the campaign is good, but with notable cliches. I would rate the game 4/5 stars, or 7/10 stars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Graphics, Awesome Missions A Must Get For Extreme Gamers!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i played for the storymode, which was good, graffics were realistic, worth $20 wait for a sale before getting the game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i realy whont this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THIS GAME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Games pretty fun one of my favorite Infinity Ward games Awaiting for DLC ;3 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think the reason people think it's laggy is because their own computers or internet connection can't handle it we are looking at better graphics inside game now time to upgrade your PC's a GPUs etc. can't run this game on 4 gigs read the recommended settings before purchasing your game peeps I dont have any lag what so ever :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is awesome!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think its quite a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST GAME EVER!! I FINISHED THE GAME IN 8 HOURS! IT HAS NEXT-GEN LONG WAITING SCREEN, NEXT-GEN FIRE SIMULATION, NEXT-GEN EXPLOSION, AND NEXT-GEN EVERYTHING!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of duty ghost is the best game i have so far i would rate it 5 stars
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game apart from the 90FPS cap, the 65 FOV (but does now have a slider to increse to 80), the lag and the camping gay noobs (but this is typical CoD) would recommend to friends and other CoD fans, the game feels more like Battlefield style compared to Black Ops 2, amazing graphics for CoD (finally) but all in all despite the few flaws, its a good game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer - broken, but nice sniper mechanics  Aliens - not as good as zombies, but alot more in line with DOOM gameplay  Campaign - Only redeeming quality as it is the first CoD since MW that had a proper storyline and remains the only 1 to this day. If you can get the game for discounted price, the campaign really isn't bad. I ran it on medium with a GTS 450 and 4gb ram, so it is the only CoD with an overstated min requirement"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game does require a monster PC to run. luckily i have such a monster. the grapics are awesome, not the greatest single player campaign done but there is a door open for a sequel. the multi-player has a challenging alien spin off which could be integrated into a whole new game. will have to wait and see.  if you have a machine capable of running this game well, and like this series buy it. if not, dont. simple as that"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game plays just like other call of duties with improvments here in there with items weapons and story. the story did feel alittle short and they could have done more but its not bad as it is. i feel like its a real good C.O.D game. the only thing that bugs me is that in pretty much any call of duty game. when your character gets into hand to hand combat he can't fight worth crap. your sapossed to be top of the top. and your character gets F'd up by a block and a punch for the most part. they need to stop making your character look â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in hand to hand fights. and the ending was bitter. obviously wanting to make a sequal to this game. but other wise it was good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fun but not great and not alought of people play (6000 is good) (also need good hardware because optimization is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥)  BUT AFTER THAT I WILL STILL PLAY THE GAME ITS A GOOD GAME ON SALE BUT UNLESS YOU ARE A DIE HARD COD FAN DONT PURCHASE FOR 60
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome game. ignore the haters. they just like to hate. people dont understand. its not the peeps exsperience but the player's. so give it a try. you can decide if you like it or not
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i have a pre order pc version of ghost and i am not able to find the ghost mask :/ dissapointed
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool game once you figure out the spawns.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excelent game, plays superb on my gaming laptop, A+++"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome :D must buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun,Easy and addicting c:"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is so ausome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love It
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game feels nice and snappy, a bit like the previous games by Infinity Ward. It gets a lot of hate from CoD haters, which I can understand, especially with the whole story around the recycled cutscene, but honestly, it's never fuzzed me. I enjoy the storyline, I like the gameplay, and I especially like how they remade the class-building system when it comes down to perks and attachments. All in all, it's a great game, that I'll be playing a LOT (I'm already at 46 hours, compared to my 96 hours in MW3), I'll probably breach the 200-mark before/midway summer!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would recommend this game for those who are fans of the game and those who are interested to purches and for those who say that this game has laggs in multiplayer, they should go and play there battlefield and shut up, unless they try it first. In conclusion I won't regret that I've purshed this game good luck at the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun,very fun,and beast"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think its quite a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not bad but prefer the previous cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"EXCELLENT GAME, SHORT STORY THOUGH"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like this game this is the best cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,NIce game really nice campaign finally treyarch as maked giant maps but a lots of sounds are taked from Modern Warfare 3.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Loads of fun as a Call of Duty game tends to always be. Looks incredible, has some really fun and varied missions in the single player, and the same old addictive multiplayer is just as addicting as always.   There are some problems that still need to be fixed like some performance issues, and this strange sound issue during the loading screens of single player missions. Hopefully they get fixed soon, but the game is still more than playable and after finishing the single player, I'm still looking forward to more!   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty is a series with as many fans as the internet is vocal about its every misstep. Iâ€™ve played them since the second one and have seen both highs and lows. Which is the latest Call of Duty: Ghosts? Read on to find out more.  I may be a huge Battlefield fan, but Iâ€™m also a Call of Duty fan. It never holds my attention for as long as Battlefield, but I always seem to come back to it. They are epic singleplayer shooters, and great if not frantic online games. Frantic can be good, but it can be horrible too.  This Call of Duty seems to be set in the near-future setting, kind of like Black Ops 2, but in a more post-apocalyptic setting. I like the setting, really nice change from the hurrah of the past 3. Personally, I found that the Modern Warfare trilogy overstayed its welcome and got stale and a bit boring.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this game !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm the kind of Call of Duty player that pops open the game case, gathers up my buddies, and jumps right into the fantastic, addictive multiplayer with less than a glance at the single-player and co-op modes. And that's how I suggest you approach the latest entry in the Call of Duty series. Call of Duty: Ghosts hits all of the Call of Duty bulletpoints: precise controls, refined multiplayer gameplay, and a ton of content to keep you coming back again and again. But it doesn't take any chances or bring anything significant to the table, especially in the single-player and co-op modes. Never before has a game in the series felt so stagnant. While the shooter is a solid FPS experience all around, it's missing the creative passion that made its predecessors shine."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game!!! and all call of duty. I have not playd this game so much but after the first mach i loved it!! so thank you for making so awesome games!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fucq those campers!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,-Bought the game from GameStop -Went home -Opened my 'LAPTOP' -Downloaded the game -A warning appears that I don't have 6 GB RAM and it will go horrible -I don't give a fk and I open it -Lag everywhere -Closed and felt dissapointed -Went to youtube -Searched Call of Duty: Ghosts walkthrough -Watched all the missions -I realised that the game was bad -Broke the CD  10/10 would buy again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worth it kind of but still the last call of duty was light years ahead this new black op style no good akimbo sucks.And there losing players big time so lots of rooms with not many pips playing.The last call of duty was the best fps online ever wiht the akimbo p90 untill they bring back a good akimbo selction iam not playing much i miss the good old days so bad when call of duty was fun.Bring back the akimbo the game needs ballance it so camper sniper based it sucks you need more run and gun type stuff not run and die.Bring back the legend the p90 make the game fun agian.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,SP 5.0/10 MP 7.0/10 Extinction 9.0/10 It is a good game but is a bit lacking in features but still good. The multiplayer in this certain CoD Title could be good but with all the players camping making the games hit the time limit sort of ruin the game but with smaller maps to be added later they will hopefully adress this issue. People always complain about optimization which i agreee with due to my pc only getting a average of 80FPS when i can get 120FPS on bf4.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too legitimate for myself.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Last good COD and you can buy it for a low price these days
Call of Duty: Ghosts,100% Recommended for the fans of the series. Ghosts has many many different game types and modes and every one is well thought out and fun. The amount of content and quality makes this game a must have for any FPS lover. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts," Buying CoD:Ghosts is a very personal decision  They got off with a bad start, but the game is turning into something half decent now. Can't really say, I had alot of the issues other people had, myself. Purchasing this game is a very personal decision and you've got to ask yourself if you're willing to pay for more of the same, just slightly new/changed features. I did and I have quite some fun with it. Extended thoughts below!    The Past  The CoD series will never return to their full glory. CoD 2 MP was incredibly well done and the game offered a nice single player campaign back then. When Modern Warfare came out, it boosted the series and it became even more popular due to the modern combat, at least it was more appealing to me after all the years of WW2 shooters. MW2 slightly topped it's predecessor, as it added more to the already awesome game that was Modern Warfare. It went downhill from there..  BlackOps was okay but didn't nearly excite me as much as the MW did, MW3 was just a moneygrab and it all became more of the same.   The Present  I was skeptical about the CoD:Ghosts release, expecting more of the same and even though this is probably also true, one way or another this games makes me feel alot like back when I played MW and MW2. What I like about Ghosts is the customization, the way it's done with the perks and attachments being unlocked with squadpoints regardless of your level, enables you to play with your favorite weapons, perks and attachments right from the start (pretty much). Operations and Clanwars are things that keep you playing, given you are in a clan (of at least 3 people) and actively participate in the weekly clan wars. Group up with some people if you want to get more satisfaction out of playing the game.  What's a bit crappy about Ghosts is the optimization, even though I didn't have alot of the issues people encountered, I still feel the game doesn't run smooth, 60fps, but with occasional stutters or a screenfreeze, usually right at the moment you are trying to kill someone. Could get annoying and might get under your skin but it's just a minor annoyance, at least on my part. The hackers on the other hand (that recently started coming in) are quite annoying and reporting them is/feels useless.  If you've been a fan of the CoD series in the past this game is certainly one to pick up (during a sale). Singleplayer is fastpaced and quite short, but that doesn't matter, it's really actionpacked and keeps you entertained the entire way. Multiplayer feels like MW2 to me but alot of 'new' or rather changed features make it a better version of MW2. The addition of integrated clans and clanwars makes the replayvalue slightly higher."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this game not playable wait til updates are released  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game would rock if they got rid of the hackers, and gave us back dedicated servers, pc gamers get ripped!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not easy to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,where can i download the camo 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am a long time COD fan, but I feel more than a little let down by this title. I'm not really sure why they bothered with a single player mode here. It is too short (3-4 hours with a lot of cutscenes), too predictable (yes, you do have to fend off enemy vehicles from the back of a truck) and they copied whole scenes from past games...It feels like an afterthought.  I really want to like this game. The multiplayer is fun, but it was clearly designed for platform gaming. The PC release is horrendous, plagued by lag, bad optimization and massive stuttering. Getting better, but for weeks it was completely unplayable...   The squads mode is a nice touch if you like playing with bots. In fact, this is one of the few modes that is currently playable if you don't mind the game crashing every 4 or 5 maps.   They relegated clans to 4x4 games. Not implemented well. It is so cumbersome to sign people up and there are rarely people playing that mode so you can't find a game.   Rarely can you find more than a few hundred playing any particular mode. The only modes that seem popular are team deathmatch (normal) and Domination (hotpoint) If you are more of a lone wolf, you will have a hard time finding a game.  The less popular modes are often less than 100 players while some of the big team modes have a few thousand.   I think the PC version was released far too soon, a lot of players who were excited about the release just stopped playing a week after the release because of the bugs and failed implementation.   What I really wanted out of this game was a way I could play with my friends and the closest this comes is you forming a squad with your friends and playing against bots, or you can form a party and join a team match...   There are some things I really like about this game, some of the maps are fairly large for COD, the perks and loadout customization are interesting. Allowing you to purchase multiple squad members to load each one differently is a nice change of pace. It plays a lot more like Battlefield 3 than COD.   I think the game is getting more stable and more playable with each patch. I would recommend it, it is fun, but given all that went wrong with this releaseI would only have given it 2 out of 5 stars at release. I will bump it up a star because it is more playable. I would give another star if they would implement dedicated (ranked) servers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Okay so it was a dlc at first but now is starting to run smooth...hackers are getting to be less (probably getting bored)..If you have a clan that is active enough squads is the way to go...8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaing is good. Multyplayer isnt so good. Im sure thath this isnt the best CoD. And for most people the game doesnt work good. I have really good computer and still frezzes sometimes. Rating: 7,5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just don't get why everyone hates call of duty. CoD:Ghosts is not a bad game at all. Apart from its predecessors, the background of this game draws on a unique event that the US were being attack by the Federation of South America. No more Arabic, Russian or Chinese cliches. I think this game was inspired by fans' obsession of Ghost in Modern Warfare 2 in which Ghost's identity is still remain as a mystery. The graphics of this game cleary improved compared to the old CoDs. Personally I think Battllefield 4 has better graphics, but the new CoD has outstanding graphics as well. I have no idea why people keep criticizing CoD for its 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics.' CoD used to be a game for only outstanding machines (on PC platform). Gradually the developers aimed to make this game a McDonald's kind of game which normal machines have no problem running it. I was astonished by the ending. I'm waiting for CoD: Ghosts II."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hello Infinity Ward : In My Point of view .. call of duty ghosts Beautiful game if you play it lonely for fun but if we back to cod4 and mw2 we was big Community for 1 reason . and the reason is Cod 4 and Cod6 Fast Games moreever lets back with time what we see? we will see Number of Players ON PC minimum 150 000 - 200 000 and cod7-8-9 coming with bad mode furthermore many cods = Division Players i think COD Time has been Disable but &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; if COD Team Create Call of Duty Like Cod4 but like graphics MW2 and this Call of Duty name be COD The End &gt;&gt; create this game for online mode only without Single Player And Dont Publish any cod after To Bring the players First And this game to be with lvls like warrock and wolfteam system LVL its only Advice i know COD TEAM cant do it but we want to back the Community its only ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- COD GHOSTS have many bugs and game without servers = 0 COD GHOSTS have new gameplay its not ok for cod fans More Advice For COD TEAM dont held battelfield with graphics i Mean  Dx11 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COD FAIL its only other Advice  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if COD TEAM Cooperationing with cod fans like me 100% the Community will back because on pc was high number now xbox one and ps4 .. the number will down day after day so the new cod after ghosts 100% fail --------------------- i say big sentance &gt; Just Create Single Game Like Pro Mod COD 4 and With warrock system lvl or wolf team for lvls and system for clan wars S&amp;D and see how much players will back to COD or no :( its only .. and very very sorry for bad english
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A polished gem. A return to the first two Call of Duty Modern Warfare games that we know and love. I first played COD: Modern Warfare 2 on the Xbox 360 after all of the hype it received. I played through the single player campaign and I loved it. Great story, voice acting, intriguing characters, action packed, and awesome visuals. The multiplayer also brought something new to the FPS genre with kill streaks, different game modes such as domination and search and destroy, and call signs.   After that I played COD: Modern Warfare and I loved it as well. Both the first and second Modern Warfare games had developed stories with interesting characters. Modern Warfare 3 was a deviation from the first two Modern Warfare games. It contained hackneyed themes and underdeveloped story.   If you liked the first two Modern Warfare games I would definitely recommend you to buy COD: Ghosts. It has updated next-gen graphics, character development and story is huge improvement over Modern Warfare 3 and *laugh* Black Ops.  You will read a lot of negative reviews. YOU WILL HATE THIS GAME WHEN YOU FIRST PLAY IT. I paid $60 for a Steam game, downloaded it, and it runs like GARBAGE. It is full of bugs, random crashes, lag, stuttering, etc. If you have some patience and optimize it for your PC (go into Video Options, Advanced Video, and adjust the settings for your specific hardware) you will enjoy this game! PC games are not like console games, they are not optimized for everybody. Once you get this game running optimal to your system the gameplay is very solid and smooth.  PROS: Next-Gen Graphics Developed Story Interesting Characters Action Packed Call Of Duty That We All Know And Love  Cons: Gameplay Lag Multiplayer Hackers (Yes They Exist)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I personally recommend you not to buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and suffer like I did. 0/1000000000
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing epic except for the lag, op gun aids fov and hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not understand why everybody hates Ghosts. It is by far my most favourite COD game:  Singleplayer has many fun elements to it - Multiplayer is amazing: Some maps like Strikezone are really fun to play in and customisation has reached a new level, with the new ability to also change your squad's looks. It is annoying how you have to 'activate' challenges to complete them (to unlock customisation and stuff). Titles and emblems have now been converted into patches and backgrounds, which is nice. I also love how some guns have integrated attachments - and it is so satisfying to be rid of overpowered machine pistols. There are now Marksman and Sniper Rifles: Marksman rifles are basically semi automatic, while Sniper rifles are the hardcore bolt-action types. This is nice, for people who aren't that good with sniping, while the hardcore snipers can still bust their moves (personally, I prefer the bolt action Sniper Rifles).  However, if everyone is put off by the other reviews, then I would advise one to wait for a sale, or at least try to find a way to try it out, but trust me, if you have a deep wallet - like me ;) - then it is a great game.  P.S. the playtime is for singleplayer only, I've played multiplayer a lot more ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,May be my last purchase for Call of Duty games...   P.S. I'm a fan of Modern Warfare series and COD have disappoint me...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nope. Don't buy this, not worth all the problems you'll get."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've been fan of Call of Duty since first one and played every single one that was available for pc but with ghosts its over for me. Its not how it used to be and the way Activision ignores PC players time to move on. Ghosts is good game but it misses on something that Modern Warfare franchise was good at.   FAREWELL CALL OF DUTY IT WAS ONE EPIC RIDE THAT I'LL REMEMBER FOREVER :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is really cool with a team in clan wars and his graphics are pretty cool but not as much as BF4 =S also .... I got a lot of fps shutdown while playing or instant crash .... really dispointing ... so, i recommand this game for all players who had already played a CoD game and like to get killed by 3-4 bullets ... look like hardcore in any game mode ...  Like if you enjoy this comment =)  And have fun if you enjoyed too this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is good but there is so much hackers!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a good game! :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is pretty terrible in my opinion, but the saving grace of this game is Squads and Extinction... Those 2 parts of the game actually make me enjoy the gameplay"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome! need more PC players.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"People may complain about FPS drops and various other issues while playing the game, but put that down to their computer not being able to cope. I have more than one computer, and it works fine on my newer one, on the highest resolution and graphic settings. Although on my older compter, as it only has 4G ram, it runs fine on the minimum graphics, but anything higher causes FPS to drop, and its gets slow and glitchy, and will even completley stop at times. Don't blame the game, its your machine thats â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   I highly recomend the game, the single player is unique and and different than the other Call of Duty games, although still keeping the first person shooter genre obviously. There is also a new multiplayer/singleplayer game mode called Extinction, and i dare say its better the Zombies, takes a lot more strategy, planning, and teamwork. Multiplayer is like usual, unique new maps, destructable surroundings (this is only new to Call of Duty), can customize your actual character (name, gender, facial features, uniform, helmets, classes.) which is nice.   If you have liked any of the previous Call of Duty games, or just like first person shooters, i highly recommend, so long as you have the system requirements, and you don't try to run the game beyond your computers capabilities."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"OK-OK-OK, I know everyone hates the game for 'being laggy', and 'too buggy to play' but I honesty like the game, a lot. When Activision gets it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together it could possibly beat BF4 in more ways than just SP. Wait it out guys... like seriously, remember MW2? That game was buggy and laggy and glitchy AS HELL early on. Now it's the best CoD around. So Summary Good game Wait it out, time will show it's beauty."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghost 8.5/10 - Awesome!!  I'm Reviewing this Based on what 'I Experience with The GAME'. And no, I'm not an Expert Reviewer. As a writer of this review, I'm ready to see any Comments, Negative, or Positive about this review, anything. I'm ready. so I Try to Review this game the best I Can. If you Want to give a Critics, Please Leave it the Comments :)  Idk why, so much hate on this game, I Mean, It's Call of Duty, It's a Great Game btw. I know I Just played this Game not more than 100 Hours, but at Least I've been Try the Single Player, and Multiplayer. The Singleplayer storyline actually Pretty Good, Not That Bad. It's Fun, I Mean it tooks 6 Hours for me to Complete it. And Technically I didn't have any bugs or issues whilst playing. I was able to play on a steady 60 fps on my Laptop which has an i7 CPU and GTX 950M.   Multiplayer. Most of the People give it Negative about it, Bugs, issues with connection, or FPS drops, or Anythings. I Never experience any of That, even on my laptop, It's Smooth. Took so Long to Find Match? Well, Most people are already leave the Game, and Not so Much People playing it again. I still Play the Multiplayer with BOTs, Since this Game features a Bot Match that can Give you XP to Rank Up, for ME It's Fun Honestly, Even with BOTs it still Playable on 60 FPS, no Bugs, and Other.   Ok, In Conclusion. I did have a lot of fun whilst playing it, however the price of $35 is a Bit Expensive especially for a game which has been out almost three years now. If You a guy just like me, who Like to Just Play the Game, and Play Multiplayer for Fun, I Would Recommend it when The Price is drop about $10 since The Multiplayer almost dead Now. I'm Not saying that This Game is SO Good, and Not saying This Game is BAD, I Mean this Game is Okay and Fun to Play, But get it, If You Really want to Having fun, and Play the Game, and don't Care about Multiplayer. But if You a Gamer who likes to Play the Multiplayer, I Wouldn't suggest you This Game, Since The Community of this Game is Almost dead, No Newer Updates, no More Double XP Event.   So I Recommend this Game when On SALE. It's a Fun Game to Play, and It's Call of Duty.  That's my Review, If You Have and Opinion, or Critics, Please Leave it in The Comment :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is not worth 89.99 AUD, its probably worth it at 20-40 bucks.  PC PORT ISSUES First off, this game is VERY POORLY OPTIMISED for PC out of the box. A quick google search will advise you as to which settings you need to change to make it look 'next gen' and run smoothly. Once this is done then graphics and gameplay responsiveness cannot be faulted.   PING ISSUES There are issues with servers. It runs a hosting P2P type setup, even though dedicated servers were promised. The config file is set so that your max_clientping=800ms as default. This is absolute rubbish and is the main reason why people get such horrible lag. You need to search google find the name of the file to modify and set the max client ping to something like 40-100ms. In Australia you are still able to find games in TDM/domination/FFA off peak with this setting.  MP GAMEPLAY ISSUES There are some big differences between this game and previous call of duty games.  Firstly, multiplayer IS different.   - Maps are much larger  - IT IS NOT SETUP AS A RUSHING SMG/SHOTGUN GAME. If you play this style on most maps you're gonna have a bad time. Once you adapt to the larger maps, the guns are more balanced, and the playstyle is more slow down, aim around corners, ensure your path is clear and avoid open ground. Alot of the negative reviews about the gameplay are based on the fact that it is NOT your rush type game anymore.  - The 'prestiging' and levelling up of weapons is completely different, you earn sqaud points which you spend to unlock the next character, each character you get to 60 gives you a prestige lvl, you unlock weapons and their attachments with squad points. You are squadpoint starved at the start and it can feel quite frustrating. This is not an issue once you get a nice weapon and setup. You can also unlock perks in advance of the lvl unlock by spending squad points on them. You also gain extra perk slots by unequipping a secondary weapon, tactical and lethal slot.   SINGLE PLAYER interesting, with some nice features, but ultimately is not immersive. But it is still 'fun', but it contains all elements of prev COD/battlefield gameplay, shoot from a heli, sneak here, kill these hordes of people, ride this car, dive in this area. The zones in which these missions takes place are pretty cool, the jungle looks amazing with lighting/plants.   SUMMARY GRAPHICS - 8/10 GAMEPLAY - SP - 7/10 GAMEPLAY - MP - 8.5/10 HACKING - HUGE MASSIVE ISSUE, is dropping off, but quite obvious walling on occasion. No visible action is taken by IW with regards to the 'report player' function.   OVERALL 7.5/10 Poor PC port but can be tweaked with minimal effort and googling to how it should have been out of the box. Once you have adapted to the larger maps, the lack of rushing, the different weapons it is a very enjoyable experience.    "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"MP The best COD game for the last 3 years. If youre a COD fan then get this game.  this game is hated upon for no definite reason, the game is simply awesome. might not be as good as BO2 or MW2 but it is realistic and fun.  THIS GAME IS ALOTTTT BETTER THE BLACK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3 AND ADVANCE SHITFARE.   But beware there are many campers.  SP  Delivers the IW experiance although not as good as the WW2 and MW series, this game has agreat story over all. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,My last COD game was Black Ops. This one looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and is stupid as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is an amazing game with a mindblowing campaign. 10/10 for sure!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"good game, a little bit laggy and many hackers and cheaters, but im enyoing it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"good game, but have a lot of hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love this game its so awesome, and cant see why its so few players..., its a too good game for how many player, why not buy it today?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Need FOV Changer and unlocked the fps from 91 to 144 All in all.. Good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A bit different than CoD:Black Ops II , but still a fun game to play, and kill hours and hours of time. Really like the large maps, which is odd because in the previous version, I prefered the smaller maps. Overall an enjoyable game to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What do I have to say? The campaign so far is really interrestin', the multiplayer is really interrestin', as Infinity Ward was really doing alot of experiemnts to make the game interresting. What is bad about it? The community is having a horrible time adapting to the game, since they are used to running away from bullets perfectly fine like they usually have been able to. The overall PC optimization could definitely have been alot better, including an FOV slider to please everyone who keeps complaining about it and never learning to adapt themselves.  Do I enjoy it? I surely do."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As with most COD titles, the single player campaign is pretty good. The new engine looks and feels adeguate but nothing spectacular. Mulyiplayer feels a lot like BOPS 2 so if you're into run and gun style of gameplay, this game is for you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Love this game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game is good but it needs more COLOR PLZ
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love this game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a decent COD game, not recommended if you are only looking to play multiplayer, BO1/2 is still better imo. Extinction is a lot of fun, but you will need to get all DLC for the entire map listing, they made a pretty decent story and very co-op fun mode with extinction. But if you stick with the regular game, extinction Point of Contact is 'eh ok.' The story mode of the game, I thought was a pretty decent one. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. It had a moment similar to ghost getting set on fire, where I was like, ' ALL I SEE IS RED, YOU SON's A BEECHES ARE GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!!!' And the ending reminded me of the end of MW2, felt good having completed it, something â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up happens, and your like ah â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ na....... Ill find you in the next one"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Of The Year. It's no revelation, it's just your Call of Duty fix you can't get anywhere else. There is no shady business here, no PR lies, no crappy software and browser plugins, no overused contrast, bloom or colour correction. No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Just buy it wherever you like and press play for your authentic Call of Duty Experience. Nothing more, nothing less."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So many people hate on this game 'mainly cause there bad at the game lmao'. Needs some fixes 'match making taking forever to find games, SO MANY HACKERS, and NO HC SND' other then all that great game way better then mw3 or black ops 2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer needs some work and by some work I mean optimising/fixing, crazy frame drops during game play. The game had a 6GB Ram requirement which was locked so if you didn't have 6GB Ram you couldn't play the game - this was lifted in the last patch but Iâ€™m running 8GB RAM the good hearty expensive â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, 6 Core Phenom II 3.4ghz AMD 7970:3GDDR5 and during multiplayer you will see noticeable and random drops during play depending on where you are on the map.  Now minus the flaws which I am in no doubt will be patched as every AAA title publisher seems to insist on releasing Beta quality games these days followed by 6 months of patching to make the bloody thing work correctly, and before people point fingers at this being a PC problem the console version has a stack of issues also.  I can whole heartedly say the Campaign is one of the best COD experiences Iâ€™ve had, you will struggle to find many good reviews but personally I enjoyed it, its typically very short but it continually burns your eyes with amazingly good cinematic experiences &amp; eye candy SOME of which do appear to have been copied from recent blockbuster films.... Batman - Dark Knight Rises opening scene... tanks falling from planes Iâ€™m quite sure that was the A-Team film!  Campaign... well worth it, multiplayer... playable on a high end card and system but I wouldn't expect the world from it yet, many hacks already present in online play which does spoil it but if you have a good set of friends who have emptied their pockets on a powerful rig you will enjoy multiplayer just fine. Patience... lots of patience required for the patches but they do come just slowly!  I am really struggling to keep tight lipped about the last few chapters of the campaign so Iâ€™ll stop writing before I end up writing a spoiler!   Product update 26.11.2013  208mb patch released today for the multiplayer making noticeable improvements in game. This patch has also added PhysX for NVidia cards, playing with an AMD card I am seeing more stable frame rates throughout the maps. Additional options in the Video/Graphics menus to bump up the terrain quality to â€˜Extraâ€™ and I believe some of the other video options now push up past high to the extra setting. Iâ€™ll post the patch notes when they put online on the review for full changes but they are yet to surface."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, needs an update tho."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not a big multiplayer like at all, but I love the fact that this game has bots! The specs are a little fake as well. I have 8GB of RAM and the game runs flawlessly with everything turned up to the max; that's with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 (2GB). You don't really notice the storyline at all cause the visuals are really nice. But overall the multiplayer will keep the game going for a while. I realize this review isn't the greatest. Look, the game is great to play if your playing the Multiplayer aspect. I on the other hand am just playing the Single Player and the Multiplayer portion with Bots. So for me the game wasn't really worth the $60 price tag. The multiplayer is really robust and has alot to offer. BUT if all your gonna play is the Single Player portion then don't bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, good job, Graphics, Textures, sound FX, Characters, ETC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS IS A GOOD GAME NOW WHERE IS MY FESTIVE PACK????
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campaign is good. graphics could be better. the multiplayer feels like all the other call of duty series with minor improvements . best part of the game is the squads and clan battle features. dont like the fact you have to purchase everything with battle points. As usual there are already people hacking the game. so far i have encountered several that have prestigue hacked and several that are using a perk hack that allows them all the perks in their load outs. good game bad vac as usual. why would steam change that.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I whole heartedyl recommend this game for campaign\. I imagine the complaints are about multiplayer. The graphics are amazing. I really take the time to zoom in close and see how the textures really look and this game does not disappoint. The story and production values are top notch. Lots of fun and a great game.. 9/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really good game! Runs best on Nvidia, Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Recommended settings OS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit  CPU: IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5 â€“ 680 @ 3.6GHz  RAM: 8 GB RAM  HDD : 40 GB HD space  Video: NVIDIAÂ® GeForceâ„¢ GTX 760 @ 4GB  Sound: DirectXÂ® compatible sound card  DirectXÂ®: DirectXÂ® 11   Don't see AMD in there."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best COD ever made........
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a decent COD game, not recommended if you are only looking to play multiplayer, BO1/2 is still better imo.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"5/10 - The game gets 5 points based on the interesting single player campaign and a fun to play multiplayer experience as all call of duty games have had since modern warfare. However, this game is graphically not made any progress since black ops 2 and in fact may have gotten worse. The game is extremely buggy and glitchy. What I mean by this is fram rates vary from 190 FPS to 17 FPS on my computer. Scoping in with the weapons (particularly sniper rifles) causes my frame rates to cut in half. I can run games of better graphics quality with a higher and ALOT more consistant FPS and its just frustrating. I ended up unintalling before completing the campaign. If the game gets patched to fix bugs and glitches, while still being inferior to previous call of duty's, would make the game at least a 7/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not much of an improvement. Rediculously overpriced for what it is.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Of The Year. It's no revelation, it's just your Call of Duty fix you can't get anywhere else.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am glad I was given this game. I started playing it the next day after Christmas. The graphic art work is great and looks so real it is like being there. Other computer games like Comandos are like cartoons compaired to Call of Duty (Ghosts). I like the way you can do all sorts of things in the game and try different ideas each time you die. Thank the artiests for their time and skill in making a great game. Keep up the great work. Again everything looks so real you can feel the dirt under your feet. Keep it up.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Typical Call of Duty ever seen
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When i first bought the game I thought it would'nt be that good but surprisingly its good. The story is good, the combat feels nice and customizing is amazing!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Let me tell you something abut this game : Extra graphics, awsome Single Player and also epic multyplayer.   Play it. :D  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recommend this game if you have a powerful enough rig to enjoy its crisp DX11 visuals (thanks to next-gen consoles). Though I notice a lot of players with older, mid-range GPUs complain of FPS lag, the graphics is definitely a step up from its DX9 predecessor, Black Ops 2.   Gameplay and feel is similar to MW3, but with Squad and Extinction mode. So really you get more for your buck than previous IW games. As an aside, I truly enjoyed the Single Player campaign, it's pretty immersive and much better made than Black Ops 2 SP.  Quite upsetting however is the lack of dedicated servers, which enables cheaters to roam freely in any game lobby without swift repurcussions. It will be up to every other player in the lobby to back out and find another lobby, in hopes not to land in another lobby with a cheater, rather than kick the offending player; it's seriously quite aggravating at times.  Overall, I'm having loads of fun in this game, and because of its stunning visuals, immersive SP and added Squad/Extinction content, I recommend this game.  A brief of my rig which runs the game @ 55-75 FPS: i5 760 @ 4.0ghz Nvidia GTX 670  Settings you should have to enjoy stunning visuals: Image quality: Extra Texture, Specular, and Map Resolution: Extra"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hi this game is not bad but call of duty black opp 2 is better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good pc graphics excellent
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"IW really equalized the game. There's no over powered weapons or attatchments like in mw2 &gt;.&gt; If IW can optimize the game for PC, it would be great. even the best rigs experience memory leaks and frame hiccups"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome. great graphics decent story mode, the only complaint is not enough players online compared to the consoles which is a downer, and sometimes there can be cheaters, but overall its cool like any other cod game. need a good high end rig to play this good"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A good game, I think its one of the best games out there for call of duty but there is one problem, if your computer does not have 8 gb of ram then cod ghosts will not run properly on your computer, when joining matches it will be super laggy in the begining of a match and this always happens. On the disk cover, it says the minimum # of gb of ram to run this game is 6 but its 8. So if you have 6 or 4, then i would not buy this game yet, buy some more ram sticks for your computer and then buy the game once you have 8 gb of ram!    -I hoped this helped :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD: Ghosts is a tactic-shooter. And it is a pretty good game. I can't say if you should buy it or not, but what I know is that I like it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's the best of all Call of Duty series! It's graphics are real life and the dynamics are wonderfull!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome story for a CoD game, gameplay is what you would expect, visuals and environment are exceptional."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a fun game

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well i dont know what problems the others are facing..although there are some frame rate drops n lags..i still cant get my hands off it..there are matches with no log..with no frame rate drops..if u want to play the game try it..there is no better way to judge the game..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome story for a CoD game, gameplay is what you would expect, visuals and environment are exceptional."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's fun but not getting much support from developers for pc players
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game but u need a really good pc for it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but full of hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same Call of Duty mechanic. For all of you run and gun lovers, this game is more action packed than ever. So if you liked Call of Duty before, don't hesitate to buy this one. If however you didn't or you think that they should have improved, then the 'improvements' ar rather small.  Singleplayer packs a nice, short, concentrated storyline. No spoilers.  Multiplayer is much more focused on the soldier and him on the ground. The killstreaks stay in the same mechanic as in Modern Warfare 3, where you have the Assault, Support and Specialist Strike Packages. Some new addition to it is the fact that you don't have only classes, but you have a soldier that wears those classes. In total you can unlock (through in-game money purchase) ten soldiers, visually customizable and levelable. You theoretically prestige your individual soldiers.  A new addition is Squads. A 'co-op like' part of the game, in which you (and your friends, if you have any) team up and level up your (like in you, not them) squad, in different game modes, that include: Facing of a team of bots (variable difficulty) on Multiplayer game-modes; Fighting with your AI Squad against another player and their AI Squad (not party allowed). Survivor mode.  Brand new Extinction mode, isn't much innovative, it's sort of like zombies, but it takes a different approach to the way the enemies behave. You fight aliens which are much more agile.  This game is a lot of fun, especially with some friends. If you are one of those Battlefield instead of Call of Duty, or the other way around, kind of guy, then you are wrong, in any of the cases. Battlefield requires 5+ friends in order to fully enjoy its true potential (no comment, it is brilliant), while Call of Duty is a lot of fun alone, too, but friends add alot to it. Hope you enjoyed the review, and I hope I stayed as objective as possible."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THe controls on the PC is really bad... Now i am mad that i bought the game ... :|
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game but u need a really good pc for it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome game! bit of lagg though :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The singleplayer and the multiplayer works just fine(if you have computer that can handle it). But i hope people would check if their computer is good enough before they buy the game. Everything runs perfectly smoothly for me. The only negative about the multiplayer is that there still are hackers in some lobbies and the spawns are crappy in some gamemodes. For the people who complain about that there is no FOVchanger there is one to download and it does not count as hacking etc, so you wont be vac banned if u use it. I would give the game a rating of 87/100 and definatly recommend it but please check if your computer can handle it before u buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Call-Of-Duty Ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS BOSS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is very good game i eecommend.!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great FPS game. It's like you're in a world of life, Next thing you know it is that You got missles fiering down on you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game very much. single player game has a few wtf moments i like. Multiplayer has great features like squads, extinction, survival and wargames. sliding, killstreaks, squad points and many more addons make this in features a better game then MW3 imho. altho i prefered old survival better then the new its still very enjoyable especially you can play it with up to 4 people. Also love that you dont have to go against other people to get xp for your online profile. altho the xp cap is a bit unfair at points :).   i very much enjoy playing this game. and already cant wait for new maps to come :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game andi liek it :D   but i really got serious lag :(( i play in 800x600 :((( plz fix it plz :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,In a few words. Better than MW3 but not nearly as good as MW2 or any of Treyarch titles.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like it, people should stop complaining tbh."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can you not get the christmas stuff on steam? Great game over all but waaaaaay too many aimbotters for the length of time its been out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While I enjoy playing Ghosts quite a bit, the game has soooooo much more potential that it's really a shame that IW couldn't quite pull it off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing graphics and a great campaign story. Can't wait for the next one to come out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is very good to play but there are still alot of hackers on here. an plus you have to have at least 8 gbs of ram to play it i started it with 4 gbs of ram an it was lagging alot so i upgraded my ram an its doing alot better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can you not get the christmas stuff on steam? Great game over all but waaaaaay too many aimbotters for the length of time its been out

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game and awesome gameplay!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game now has anti-cheat no more hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, I would like everyone to try it atleast once!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, despite what others say. It has a very good lasting appeal, certainly better if you play Multiplayerwith a party of friends. I have a lower end machine, yet I still play this game on normal/high settings and get no lag and no issues. The little bit of campaign I have played has been very good, and the only downside is the large amount of hackers you can encounter in multiplayer. Valve or whatever company handles that should be cracking down on people like that."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is incredible. I had to upgrade my system a bit to get the full benefit of the graphics, but it was worth it. My computer should be set for a couple of years before needing upgrading again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game andi liek it :D   but i really got serious lag :(( i play in 800x600 :((( plz fix it plz :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,are you going to be on Wednesday
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You either love or hate Call of Duty, I get it. I've played them all from the beginning and you know, I think it lost it's touch after World at War, however I think this one is actually quite good. Sure it's the same formula, the graphics are nothing like Battlefield 4 blah blah blah. I play both Battlefield and CoD. This is a GREAT run-and-gun. The new modes are awesome when playing with friends. Being a fanboy is for console players. I would only hope PC gamers are above that. If you don't like it, play something else. I recommend this game!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is the BEST!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Save your money. This game is killing mutiplayer. Realeased a half finished game. This is a bad port with no sign of an update on the horizon.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,add me if you want to play extinction
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good multiplayer, fast with good maps and weapon balance. But now not have NUKE like at MW2. Good game for good teams. And its not for cazuals. If u lame and no aim - this is game not for u.  +ADDed Clan wars and clans rating. +Good perks system with full free use. +Now for shooting long distance u need use sights and holografic (in MW2,3,bo1,bo2 u not needed it seriosly) +u can customizate ur char and chouse face, gender!, uniform. +ingame report system. +sliding move  -not so good camo for weapon upgrate system -u can have 10 characters with 6 loadouts only = 60 loaduts but u need switch it. 6 loadouts in lobby, for others u must leave lobby. I think its not good idea for gameplay. -snipers camo uses forever or never. - 1 louncher gun for kill air support and no targeting, its like RPG.  -6gb ram and good video card (GTX560ti and better needed,) for comfort play. i have 12gb ram and gtx770, but my friends some have trouble. And i cant call in game much old players from BO2 and MW3 for play with me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, but a lot of things should be modified, and finally replace the old engine with a new one in black ops and black ops 2 engine was good, I hope the next part will be more successful if the powerful iron, buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like this game amazing gameplay amazing graphics i love it! &lt;3 good job infinite but we want servers and promod mode please for competitive players... rating 9/10 :D ... with servers and with promod mode maybe 10/10 :D :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Where to dawnload the free festive pack
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the most awesome Call of Duty i've ever played. i played many CODs before but this one is the most awesome one i really really love and recommend this game to everyone.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game , but there are a lot of problem and bugs in multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, despite what others say. It has a very good lasting appeal, certainly better if you play Multiplayerwith a party of friends.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Battlefield 4 half off today.... sucks to spend 60 on a game build a new computer with card that easily maxes out the graphics and yet a game still is a complete studderfest.   BF4 is so much better and at half off just makes it even more   http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/buy?utm_campaign=US_Battlefield4_BrandMisc_E&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=origin%20bf4&amp;sourceid=US_Battlefield4_BrandMisc_E 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have a core i7 3770k and an amd 7870 and the game runs just fine. I have all the settings set to extra, and I have no lag what so ever. I live in North America and i think I've only been in one game where i suffered from severe lag. I know a lot of people complain about lag, but I'm just not seeing it.  The single player game is just like every other call of duty game. Don't expect much and you wont be disappointed it. It's a slight let down after BO2 had alternate endings that was determined by your actions and how well you did on certain levels. That didn't happen in Ghosts, so thats a dissapointment. But lets be honest...who really plays call of duty just for the single player?  Multiplayer is a lot of the same. If you've played all the other call of duty games, then you can expect alot of the same. Sure there are some changes with the kill streaks, but not much has changed with the series over the years.   If you have played COD over the years and like the multiplayer game, then you know what to exepect, alot of the same with some minor changes with kill streaks. A lot of people will complain about lag, but I have to wonder what kind of hardware they are running, because I don't have a system that cutting edge, and it runs great for me on extra settings. If you have a decent system, dont let all the haters scare you off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A fine game with some damn fast action and some darn nice weapons. A unique new turn for the COD franchise. Love to see where this game is going with the expansionpacks hope to see some weapon DLCs like the Peacekeeper in BO2. Some nice new gamemodes never seen before.  Pros: - Fast Paced - Buy weapons before being unlocked - Free attachments on some weapons - New gamemodes  Cons: - No dedicated servers - Some lag compensation  - Needs a beast of a GPU  Single Player: 6.0/10.0 Multiplayer: 7.0/10.0 Extinction 6.0/10.0
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Live Action trailer is mentally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, watching it made me lose brain cells that I would otherwise use to shift my eyes away before viewing all of it. Storyline is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, just like Every Other Call Of Duty game. I miss the good old days when you could explore vast new worlds and complete side quests to gain cool new items. However, I am an FPS player, and I do like the Multiplayer. Lay back, take a sip of tea, mow a lil' grass, and pwn some noobs. Work hard, nap hard, play hard."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've seen all the reviews I decided not to buy the game because all of you twerps gave this game a thumbs down.. Let me just interject this is a better game than you give it credit for.. Personally the Requirements were higher the ram the video and processor but lets face it the game industry drives the pc industry I love this game anyone that has anything bad to say about it I would like to challenge them to a battle.. They still have private peer to peer play me an my buddys can load up drop in and add bots the maps are diffrent they added fog of war and the weapons systems are tight.. BF4 is crap compared to Ghosts. I took a chance last year with bf3 took them a year to get me a pc patch so i could finish the game Im not quoting my experience on that I also bought bf4 this year my girl got me cod ghosts as a present. GHOSTS VS BF4 I'll take ghosts the maps are bigger the game play is spot on and I'm ashamed i gave bf4 my cash.......
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't have 'laggy' or 'buggy' problems with the game! I like it! The only thing that is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed is the BAN system - so many hackers!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS AWSOME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,  A very good game but the graphic isnt good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really like this came, but there are laggs If you haven't got a good pc, so i think If you got 4Ghz CPU, min.8GB RAM and 2Gb DDR5 Graphicscard it is awesome"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun campaign and mulitplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is very good to play but there are still alot of hackers on here. an plus you have to have at least 8 gbs of ram to play it i started it with 4 gbs of ram an it was lagging alot so i upgraded my ram an its doing alot better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is epic  i play extinction all the time thx CoD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game andi liek it :D   but i really got serious lag :(( i play in 800x600 :((( plz fix it plz :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Story line could be better. Good game though.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Multiplayer but the campaign lacks alot.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing graphics and a great campaign story. Can't wait for the next one to come out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I myself LOVE big maps. I really enjoy all of the 'Call of Duty' games, but I always thought the maps were small. Now with 'Ghosts', the maps are larger. Lovin' it. Thank you!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You either love or hate Call of Duty, I get it. I've played them all from the beginning and you know, I think it lost it's touch after World at War, however I think this one is actually quite good. Sure it's the same formula, the graphics are nothing like Battlefield 4 blah blah blah. I play both Battlefield and CoD. This is a GREAT run-and-gun. The new modes are awesome when playing with friends. Being a fanboy is for console players. I would only hope PC gamers are above that. If you don't like it, play something else. I recommend this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't have 'laggy' or 'buggy' problems with the game! I like it! The only thing that is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed is the BAN system - so many hackers!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Save your money. This game is killing mutiplayer. Realeased a half finished game. This is a bad port with no sign of an update on the horizon.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,add me if you want to play extinction
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, but a lot of things should be modified, and finally replace the old engine with a new one in black ops and black ops 2 engine was good, I hope the next part will be more successful if the powerful iron, buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty darn good once they sorted it out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COOL THIS GAME ITS MY GAME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its just sucks, not even as good as cod4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Loving it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game now has anti-cheat no more hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game and awesome gameplay!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Where to dawnload the free festive pack
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i was buy new game Call of Duty .Ghost / game does not work. problem with Direct X. Please tell me what to do to correct the error. PS My system fully supports game options
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best Call of Duty Experience yet!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do recommend this game. Its not perfect, but its a game and feels like home. Who cares about visuals and sound, I LOVE gameplay, and this game has familiar gameplay that i can pick up and play. Whine and ***** all you want, I like this game and will support it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, despite what others say. It has a very good lasting appeal, certainly better if you play Multiplayerwith a party of friends. I have a lower end machine, yet I still play this game on normal/high settings and get no lag and no issues. The little bit of campaign I have played has been very good, and the only downside is the large amount of hackers you can encounter in multiplayer. Valve or whatever company handles that should be cracking down on people like that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Battlefield 4 half off today.... sucks to spend 60 on a game build a new computer with card that easily maxes out the graphics and yet a game still is a complete studderfest.   BF4 is so much better and at half off just makes it even more   http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/buy?utm_campaign=US_Battlefield4_BrandMisc_E&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=origin%20bf4&amp;sourceid=US_Battlefield4_BrandMisc_E

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Loving it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"a Pretty Decent Game with very good graphics , deserved a try and actually was pretty awesome :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS really good great fps and really good fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can say that the campaign of CoD Ghosts is very good and the Extinction mode is good too, but the multiplayer is not so good like in other CoD's you die very very fast and there are many hackers too , but hey if you don't care that much about the multiplayer like me and only want to play the story or the Extinction mode than you can buy it if you only want to buy the game because of the multiplayer than you'll be disappointed about the game !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Must be optimized, but no serious problems. Notice, the newcomers and the weekend warriors always shouting 'hacker' when they were killed. Every game have cheaters, Ghost isn't an exception, but not that much we heard from 'community'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a very good game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its alright
Call of Duty: Ghosts,That's good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Enjoy the game a ton! FPS could be slightly better!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great new addition to the COD range with the ability to play online with your squad bringing a new dimension to the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a good game with an excellent multiplayer... Lacking a bit with the single player but hey it's CoD and there hasn't been one that can top CoD4.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is a pice of s**t!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Games works fine on PC for me. Overall fun game. Only wish the single player lasted longer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sick game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game in best serie. If you want to see CoD - here it is. Tactics ? stealth ? Yes, it 's all there. In multiplayer, little information as never before. The battlefield is now an urban jungle with no flying trash , but the real arena , post-apocalyptic ruins of human civilization. This is not Battlefield, flaunt for its explosions. This tactical shooter where you want to not show the beautiful stunt plane or a moped , but lead his team to win and survive on the battle of . Classic Mode S &amp; D turned to S &amp; R, because the task in front of you do not survive , to wait out the fight, but break into it to save your comrades and leading them to victory. No more fanfare , excess debris extra appealing . Here people do not fight - here survive Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"*STORYMODE / SINGLEPLAYER For me it was a fresh experiance and a very very enjoyable one, the story is, well good for a FPS game and the gameplay was constantly changing and malipulating itself throughout the game keeping me entertained. However i felt that they were trying to impress too frequently and at times rather than stcking to a story, only has certain scenes to say 'LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE NEXT GEN CONSOLE EVERYBODY' , the gameplay is very linier and at times i felt like i was playing an arkade game in how i was ment to stick to the path in sutch a set way that if i fell to far behind my squod ( who you do not lead, they lead you ) the mission would fail however the arkade feal was not necacaraly a bad thing.  8/10 for the story as some scenes were added simply to leangthen the gameplay   *MULTIPLAYER Unforchanatly i have never been a fan of cods multiplayer but rather more of a battlefield player, COD along with this game are very 'arkade like' rather than realistic and this reflects in the multiplayer, the movements seem to jolly and set and the online community seem more focused on 360 degree twists before killing you.  i only played one life so far on multiplayer but when i play more ill updade by adding a comment to this recomendation if necacary  on gueswork personally id rate it as a 5-6/10 for multiplayer id reccomend battlefield   *EXTINCTION MODE This was something looked forward to when i was installing the game but so far just seems like a spin off of zombies, which is likely what it is. the aim is to defend a drill that you set at certain locations to destroy an alien threat ( some sort of alien beehive / plant ) from aliens and verious critters then move to the next location and do the same, gradularly getting harder and more challenging. I very mutch enjoy this mode however have only seen one level so far, to which i have failed to complete.  6/10, this would recieve an 8 or 9 if it wasnt so repetative   *DLC - i dont own any of the DLC as of now and likely ill not own it as it seems very multiplayer based  *************overall 7 / 10***************  *note - this is my first COD game ive played so any 'repetition' in th ceries im unaware of  - there are many problems with the game for many users, some remain unfixed, i was a lucky one in that the bad port didnt seem to hinder my pc, however caused some lag spikes at the 1st few seconds of some single player levels"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,non stop thrilling game from start till end!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a good game with an excellent multiplayer... Lacking a bit with the single player but hey it's CoD and there hasn't been one that can top CoD4.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its best game 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE BEST GAME EVER!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the most challenging games for a shooter up , also difficult in facing your oponents. Grafics are awsome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I know a lot of people are bashing on it and it's not entirely unwarranted. You have to realize that upon release a lot of multiplayer games have bugs and the game's going to get hacked a lot at the beginning. That being said a lot of people simply dislike this game because they aren't good at it. Some people were great at bo2, come to this game with a lot of enthusiasm expecting to pick up where they left off, and it doesn't always happen that way. It's a different game entirely. The maps are a lot bigger and though I hated them at first I like them now because I know them. You have to take the time to learn the maps, how the guns feel, what loadouts and routes to use. You will pick up on where people camp and it will become predictable honestly. I actually haven't seen a wall hack or aimbot in a single lobby the past 2 weeks. Since the more recent patches even I haven't experienced much lag at all and I play on a laptop at a high resolution. They've patched it a few times and will patch it more. The game will become more balanced though honestly it's not that unbalanced as it is. Lets be real, if you aren't hitting that first shot with the msbs you're losing that gun fight, I don't feel it's that op. Once the dlc begins to drop and people see different maps that maybe more suit their taste, as well as the gun dlc that's been confirmed, they will have a different outlook. If you're a cod fan you will like this game! I will say I like the small fast paced action with lanes and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that treyarch does and it's great for competitive, but those games were also flawed. You always joined games late and the other team had lode stars, vsats, warthogs, dogs, and god knows what else already in play. There were usually nasty spawn traps set up too, making it even more lame. Every cod has pros and cons remember that when playing this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,excellent but needs a good gpu
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice story, nice gameplay, i really liked the campaign! Had a blast playing the multiplayer too!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think if you give it a chance it is a really good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer was alright, nothing too interesting just usual COD action movie stuff. Multiplayer kinda changes the formula of COD, Black Ops 2 point system is back and changed a little differently. Weapons, equipment and attachments cost one point and perks can vary from 1 to 5 points. Scorestreaks are back, Assault, Support and Specialist have returned. The maps are a little to big for my tastes, some maps have destrucable stuff but not on the level of Battlefield.  Extinction is a pretty cool concept. Destroy hives while defending against aliens. You can choose different classes, different killstreak rewards and different starting pistols.  Probably get this on sale if it goes really cheap and you like action games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was initially shocked at the horrible planning by Infinity Ward and Activision to create a PC game in such a well bought franchise that would push the envelope of existing machines. I was mortified that I might not be able to get the framerates necessary to be competitive. I felt betrayed, but went ahead and bought the game anyway.   After some tweaking and major assistance from Nvidia and their driver updates, however, the game is all it is meant to be. Plays well, runs smooth. I have been on top of the leaderboards numerous times, just not consistently. My machine runs an Intel-Core i7-4770 @ 340 mhz. 16 gb ram. 2tb hard drive. Nvidia 1.5 gb GeForce 760 GTX.  I do agree with others in the fact that Infinity Ward should have delayed debut until after the bugs were worked out, but I think that was Activision pushing the envelop. I own all of the COD series, play the last five from steam, I have enjoyed them, but will probably be looking in another direction after this one is finished."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign was really mediocre... extinction isn't very fun at all... but I really like the multiplayer. Those who review it negatively most likely get too angry at the game because they die too much before trying to get any better. You need good reactions, they obviously don't have that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Must be optimized, but no serious problems. Notice, the newcomers and the weekend warriors always shouting 'hacker' when they were killed. Every game have cheaters, Ghost isn't an exception, but not that much we heard from 'community'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its nice
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Single player game.. Veteran is good but could have been harder :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game! totally recommend!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes some of the best game i ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Amazing Campaign, with great multiplayer and crazy alien horde madness..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You can shoot people
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I LOVE THIS GAME! ... But Could fix stutter and its putting too much presher on my pc, never happend with black ops 2  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think if you give it a chance it is a really good game.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE BEST GAME EVER!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,before this game was not made for pc but now that all the glitches and stuff are fixed its a much better game and i would recommend this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts can be very fun, but it can also be very frustrating with Activisions inability to match games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game to play cheers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty decent. The Extinction mode is interesting, but pretty hard. Definitly recommend bringing friends for that. The campaign is decent so far, but the graphics are a bit off. I turned it up to extra and some stuff looked great, butother stuff looked like a DS game. Otherwise, pretty average CoD experience. 6.5-7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"GREAT 8,5/10  (-0,5 for some lack of optimization, -1 for not being as incredible and surprising as Inception or Bioshock: Infinite's finale, got to keep things at a level here right?)  If you are a real fan of CoD this game is pretty much a progression of the series, in other words, you'll like it as much as any other CoD  The game is not very optimized, true, but compared to so many other so called 'next-gen' games around it runs pretty damn well on my 3 year old PC and my 2 year old stock AMD 6970. And I mean 50 FPS stable, 30 in huge vistas, after just a few minutes of tweaking the many options in the graphics menu and shutting down the physics-heavy fur, you would need some serious power to run that just like anything with nVidia Phsyx or anything similar. The new graphics are very well implemented IMHO, they don't block at any time your ability to see your target with flashy cinema-camera-like features that don't even seem like a soldier's eye at all, all the while being pretty nice to your human, real world eyes.  When I bought Black Ops 1 some years ago my processor didn't run it, but I stayed shut and bought a newer one instead of complaining to the devs about their attempt to improve the game. The game even had a graphical glitch that used to crash the game once every while, but I just waited and after a month they fixed that. People just need to get used to tweaking the options in the menus to fit your machine. You can't max everything forever.  People say they have no creativity, but I disagree. They are being very creative with what they have and they have to remain true to what their game is, otherwise it's not going to be CoD any longer. They don't have to and shouldn't be trying to be like any other game. There are so many cool games out there, each one has their own approach to FPS. This is CoD's. If you don't like it, good (or bad) for you, go play some other game, nobody is forcing you, dear example of hater, to stay here, even less to complain about it.  From what I saw, the whole campaign and a bit of MP, the game is sweet.  Epic, unrealistic, Hollywood-like scenes just as every CoD since the fourth. I never before had paused a game because of a para-drop, but for heaven sakes I was not expecting that! It does not try to say at any time it's being realistic, and it's great that way. You embrace the epicness just like you would embrace Halo's sci-fi epicness or any Hollywood action movie's epicness. And yes, it is the same on-the-rails shooter just like most others around. If you don't like this kind of SP gaming, go search something else in the not-so-long list of (mostly great as well) open-worlders. Since i've been bogged into finals and stuff, I couldn't play MP properly, against players. But the AI MP I tried was great. The bots are smart, much better than the CSS stuff I've got used to. I was actually surprised when one of them jumped to dodge my rounds. All other MP features felt like improvements over the last few games, such as cool maps that embrace the best of CoD's frantic CQB combat, an easily accessible scoreboard that doesn't crash my keyboard for pressing too many buttons, cool new balance/usefulness-focused weapons (rather than a huge rooster of rifles of which only 2 are good due to little care for balancing), interesting point reward system, and, for me, the list goes on and on.  People that compare this game to BF4 are crazy IMO. They are different games with different ideas and very different graphical engines. You can't just create an BF4 engine in the span of a year to add to your game. They needed at least 3 years of work together with several studious to make the first frostbite in 2008, more five years of improvements and investment got them their engine's third iteration, which is great. Yet, their engine is carefully tailored not to require any graphical options that might be too heavy on any machine, they save on textures and occlusion and exaggerate the lightning to mask that. In a certain way, Ghosts' engine is technically heavier than BF4's. Just look at the requirements: CoD's minimal asks for double (1024 Mb)the VRAM and 6 Gbs of RAM next to BF4's 512 Mb VRAM-4Gb Ram minimum. People often don't understand that kind of thing and start jumping to conclusions. Every game comes out with a few bugs. If the guys from other companies had the idea of making open-betas, great. But if there where none, for whichever reasons, don't expect a perfect game right off the bat.  From what I could see, this game is a logical improvement over the last. When you go to the cinema to see LOTR 2 some years after you saw the first, you have to expect what's obvious: the continuation of what they promised you with some Visual FX improvements. The game delivers much more than a disguised launcher update and a map pack, it's a whole new piece of juicy shoot-em-up impressiveness. I don't know what all those hater-commenters where expecting when they bought the game, but it delivered just what I've got used to expect from a CoD, and it was GREAT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My View of the game is different than the other reviews. I see where a low end Comp would struggle but that is the case with most new software. Keep up to date on upgrades and your system will handle it. There are ways to get the game to run smooth and with a little effort and time you might get it good enough. The Single player has a good story line and is fun to hone your skills before going online where you will meet up with some tough competition. The Multi player side is good, it has a tougher level up system and is very challenging. Unlike Ops 1 the online system has a placement system where you hit join and it places you in a lobby with others. I miss the Lobby where you pick where you go, IE crouch server or any of your regular servers you like to hang out in. Cranked is a fast paced style of game play where once you get a kill you have to keep killing or you die in 30 seconds. They are short but fast sessions, where you can earn double points and level up fast. Dont give up on this one, there latest patch lowers the minimum specs and I have yet to see one glitch or lock up in 36 hours of play. I will give this a score of 6 of 10 where Ops 1 I give a score of 8 of 10. I just like the lobby in Ops 1 better. Other then that this game offers hours of fun, once you find that sweet spot where your system runs the best. Buy it! Its worth it out of the box and is getting better!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"They need to make it able to buy one map pack at a time. Yes you save money, but not everyone has $50.00 just just throw at a game. Not to mention you can't even obtain the maps yet for pc, but you can pre-order the Season pass, with not metioned release date...WTF is that? I love playing on pc since my switch from Xbox, but I don't like waiting and with an Xbox you don't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sick game

Call of Duty: Ghosts,its nice
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its good i have all of the call of duty games from the start to now its a great run and gun game it dosnt last over 15 min a match you in and out BF4 can take 20 min plus
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is awesome and co op aliens is a ton of fun , Multiplayer needs some work but its playable with a decent video card."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well if Direct X Works and stops giving me enrecoverable errors im sure i would like the game...but YET Again Activision and Infinity ward Rushed another Call of Duty Game out within a year... Take your time and Get it Right the 1st Time
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Perfect
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game in best serie. If you want to see CoD - here it is. Tactics ? stealth ? Yes, it 's all there. In multiplayer, little information as never before. The battlefield is now an urban jungle with no flying trash , but the real arena , post-apocalyptic ruins of human civilization. This is not Battlefield, flaunt for its explosions. This tactical shooter where you want to not show the beautiful stunt plane or a moped , but lead his team to win and survive on the battle of . Classic Mode S &amp; D turned to S &amp; R, because the task in front of you do not survive , to wait out the fight, but break into it to save your comrades and leading them to victory. No more fanfare , excess debris extra appealing . Here people do not fight - here survive Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"*STORYMODE / SINGLEPLAYER For me it was a fresh experiance and a very very enjoyable one, the story is, well good for a FPS game and the gameplay was constantly changing and malipulating itself throughout the game keeping me entertained. However i felt that they were trying to impress too frequently and at times rather than stcking to a story, only has certain scenes to say 'LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE NEXT GEN CONSOLE EVERYBODY' , the gameplay is very linier and at times i felt like i was playing an arkade game in how i was ment to stick to the path in sutch a set way that if i fell to far behind my squod ( who you do not lead, they lead you ) the mission would fail however the arkade feal was not necacaraly a bad thing.  8/10 for the story as some scenes were added simply to leangthen the gameplay   *MULTIPLAYER Unforchanatly i have never been a fan of cods multiplayer but rather more of a battlefield player, COD along with this game are very 'arkade like' rather than realistic and this reflects in the multiplayer, the movements seem to jolly and set and the online community seem more focused on 360 degree twists before killing you.  i only played one life so far on multiplayer but when i play more ill updade by adding a comment to this recomendation if necacary  on gueswork personally id rate it as a 5-6/10 for multiplayer id reccomend battlefield   *EXTINCTION MODE This was something looked forward to when i was installing the game but so far just seems like a spin off of zombies, which is likely what it is. the aim is to defend a drill that you set at certain locations to destroy an alien threat ( some sort of alien beehive / plant ) from aliens and verious critters then move to the next location and do the same, gradularly getting harder and more challenging. I very mutch enjoy this mode however have only seen one level so far, to which i have failed to complete.  6/10, this would recieve an 8 or 9 if it wasnt so repetative   *DLC - i dont own any of the DLC as of now and likely ill not own it as it seems very multiplayer based  *************overall 7 / 10***************  *note - this is my first COD game ive played so any 'repetition' in th ceries im unaware of  - there are many problems with the game for many users, some remain unfixed, i was a lucky one in that the bad port didnt seem to hinder my pc, however caused some lag spikes at the 1st few seconds of some single player levels"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sick game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,non stop thrilling game from start till end!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Darn good game.... Best first person shooter ever...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Squads is fun. need more from campaign. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To start the campaign. For a game ported to 5 different platforms two of which are running on very old tech, it's a great game that runs well on last gen and great on next. I saw many connections to the Modern Warfare series and other games, movies, etc while it still maintained originality. Almost like deja-vu the links to the old games created by Infinity Ward made the experience 10x better. While there are some things I don't like (like having the greatest villain from the show 'Chuck' (aka Brandon Routh) be the brother of the protag Logan Walker.) it boiled down the a campaign that drew out the same feeling I had playing the MW series. I hope 2016 either ends or continues the storyline. Next, mulitplayer. Aas mostly a CS, TF2, Unturned, GMod gamer the big maps that all of these fams complained about made the game more enjoyable for a guy like me who can't win without having some breathing room and time between gunfights. The bot optimization in private matches, and the feature of being able to rank up with out going head to head with players who are masters at COD. Givng me time with my friends to hold the tide free from the typical 'COD kid' group. With Extinction it brings a mulitplayer system breaks from the run-and-gun of the base game or any other COD game or gamemode. I advise for anyone who is considering buying AW or BO3 to buy this game instead. This is the true latest installment of COD till we see this year what IW has in store."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very Demanding PC requirements to keep the game play smooth. If you have a stoudt PC, do it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game not as much as mw3 multiplayer but it is still good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"loouzy I have to up grade my hole rig witha new GPU just to play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, now other game requrise this much upgrade."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are a big fan of the Modern Warfare series, you'll love ghosts!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun game, you need a pretty high end PC to run it. The campaign is amazing and multiplayer is enjoying. fin"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have finished around 30% of the campaign so far , and played 2 games of extinction. I can say this game has sublime graphics and gameplay , best CoD since the original two.  Highly recommended especially if you have high-end PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, I'll just skip my impressions on multiplayer because I am a bit biased since I like COD multiplayer a lot even if I am not that good. I'll write my thoughts on the single player campaign instead, since it looks like a lot of people grounded it and complained about it. I have to say, it doesn't reach the storytelling levels of the Black Ops series, which are my favorites COD games, but it's not that bad if you take it as it's meant to be taken: a military action movie straight from the first 90's, nothing more, nothing less. The characters are flat and boring, the good guys are EXTREMELY cool and good dudes, while the bad southern americans are ruthless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s who execute civilians without any reason. Yeah, americans are the saviors, and that's an old gimmick that makes me smile, it's old school and it doesn't hurt anybody if you read through the lines. I mean, for me the Black Ops series and Spec Ops: The Line have set the bar for military shooters campaign's scripts, so I didn't expect nothing else but some macho\cool soldier\brother bro bro stuff. Of course the story behind how the Federation expanded its power is not really explained, but who cares when you can shoot every bad guy in your sight? The good thing about the story is the villain: Rorke. Totally old school villain who wants revenge for being left to die, a revenge that he takes on his old comrade Elias and his two sons. Very nicely done, not as deep as the villain from Black Ops 2, but a good effort I must say. The Ghost Team is made by Merrick and Keenan (the both who can actually set a pack of wolves on the loose with a few bullets... Yeah right), one is a grizzled veteran who looks like the latest Max Payne, the other is a sort of ninja-like sniper. Nothing is added to their personality, they are just the noisy and the silent guy. Elias is the typical good american which really has nothing to say, while Hesh is the typical soldier who'll do anything for his country. And what about Logan? The main character? Nothing, silent guy, no voice, no personality, nothing at all. I don't understand why Infinity Ward doesn't give identity to the main characters like Treyarch is doing. I think it deepens the history, but it looks like IW was a bit too lazy to give poor Logan some dialogue. And what about the dog? Well, nothing really, super intelligent Riley disappears after the first missions in the game, with it's own non optimized dynamic fur. It's a nice addition and I personally liked it, but they should have put more effort in it. What about the missions? Ok, this is the good part: the missions have a very good variety, from sneaking into a skyscraper, to stalking enemy soldiers into a forest, attacking an oil plant and going into the ocean avoiding sharks and firing bullets at other divers in pure 007 style. Oh, did I mention the space missions? They remind me of Shattered Horizon, very nice work. Now, I know a lot of people complain that CoD is a rollercoster shooter with too many scripted events, but honestly: what do you expect? It's Call of Duty, it's old school tactical shooter, if you want some sandbox action go get Farcry 3. I kinda like to play a game where I don't have to be so strategic about everything and just follow the course of the action, sometimes you need that too, I mean it is actually a lot better than some modern day action flicks, so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. Anyway, they sure can make a few adjustments like some destructible environment , or maybe something like the multiple ending choice that Treyarch did with Black Ops 2 campaign... The graphics are very good, it's an old engine, but there are some very good scenarios, too bad it's not optimized for PC (I play on a high end machine) and you'll get framerate drops for no reason at all. So does this new IW CoD so bad? Well if you are CoD fans I guess you really have to play this game's campaign, but if you are looking for some more freedom of action and innovative gameplay this is not the game for you, as it will get you really frustrated when you'll see that you'll have to wait for old Keenan to open the doors for ya :D A good effort by IW, best CoD campaign I've played after the first Modern Warfare. Peace"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Now there is a patch and it sucks... thx fÃ¼r ruin the whole game for us... u know when i started to play this there were about 30000 players and now ? only 12000 left on sunday evening ? u guys must cry about this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think the game is quite good. I like the campaign and the multiplayer, graphics are improved vs older COD games. The game, at least for me, run quite well and I didn't experience any major issues with it.  On the other hand the graphics, while vastly improved, still lag behing even Battlefield Bad Company 2. The campaign is incredibly short, there's far to many clichÃ© and there are some very annoying difficulty spikes when you'll be dying and dying because of poor design. I also do not appreciate how Activision lied about new engine and stuff when it's clearly the old engine and in some places game look identical to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing MW!!! Also the game is not made with PC in mind. I don't know what nVidia was doing with this game, but apparently nothing. There's no FOV slider, no support for tripple-screen, ultra-wide screen monitors or 3D. To even play the game If you're using monitor other that 4:3 or 16:9 you'd have to use hacks.  At the end of the day it's just another Call of Duty game. Quite a nice campaign and nice multiplayer with sub-par graphics and poor PC support. It's also too expensive for the game that's essentially a six years old. 6.5 / 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is an awesome game pepole
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is great, but some aspects arent so good, like when you open the game you can get major lag, and when playing you can get lag spikes, but overall a fantastic game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts can be very fun, but it can also be very frustrating with Activisions inability to match games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is an awesome game with great multiplayer you should get it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome game but without a really good machine this game just laggs like your on a computer from the 1980's
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game to play cheers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well i have loved most CoDs and like this one and may have some bugs here and there but what game doesn't would give this game 7.5/10 :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty fun... get it while it's on sale.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool but annoying. 8/10 #Enjoyable
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a nice game to play online although i really believe they should have concidered that low end pc gamers want to play too 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,extinction just grows and grows but so on this game kinda sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not enough people play this on PC but i still love and recomend the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome!!!!!!! it is very good love the sp mp squads and extinction and u should even check cod online the china one it is f2p
Call of Duty: Ghosts,my rig i5 sandy bridge oc at 4.8 ram 2x4gb hyperX oc at 2133 mhz video card Gtx 780 game runs fine no crashes no freezes just what i hate about is its set up for console mostly and they basicly said fu%^ the pc gamers witch is an insult they know we know pc fps shooters own any console player thats why they wont mix em ha let them lil xbox and ps cry babys play vs pc players bet u money sales gona drop on xbox and ps and increase in pc but thats just my 2cents on it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Overall very good game.  The campain is very interesting and challenging with close attention paid to modern day equiptment and tactics. The Miultiplayer is fun, but the kicker is the Squad mode; where you get to arm up while practicing. There is also an extinction mode where you play a mode much like Zombies but in this game its aliens.  I give this a 10+ Awesome sound effects, very realistic. ****Make sure your graphics card drivers are up to date to avoid a Direcx crash after download and setup !!* *****"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Single player game.. Veteran is good but could have been harder :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game! totally recommend!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes some of the best game i ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Amazing Campaign, with great multiplayer and crazy alien horde madness..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You can shoot people
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"every1 seems to share the same view about the performance and bug issues ect, dam shame dont ya think, the corperate bafoons seem to have cut some corners in order to keep the share holders grinning all the way to the bank, typical you cant even rely on the best being the best any more, eventually they all sell out in 1 way or another, shame on you infinity ward.... But in general the games ok and im sure the team at 'I-W', will grt there game face togeather if not here will be a obveious gap to fill, just think about all that consumer cash up for grabs, its a joke on how much these corperates cash in on us, seriously when you think about it the entertainment value does not in any wqay compare to the cash these guys rake in, i mean its not to bad BUT i think it could be a little bit better dont you think..."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Defintately
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is good and cool. Nice story, but too short. TOO short."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i really may not be the best but i think this game will be a fun experience to players that are with the modern warfare games and all that i have some i play but i like this game alot 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its ok, fps with some underwater sequences and building and space hanging sequences, only played the campaign for most of my playtime, multiplayer is nothing special   some people say there are fps issues but i didnt encounter any while running this on my pc, in the 30 minutes of multiplayer i played so far it was smooth as well.  get on sale   7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Huge problems with cheating using hacking in Australia and at the moment reporting these players does nothing. Otherwise fairly standard Call of Duty experience with no noticeable update to the graphics or gameplay though it doesn't really need it. The level design is interesting with more verticality than has been utilised in the past. As with the previous titles this installment has obviously been developed for Xbox and then ported over to PC, poorly at that. All in all if you have played and enjoyed COD games before pick this up but its not going to win those over who are tired with the series or never picked it up to begin with."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think the people are really mad from blops 2 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and try to get the blame to IW or any other company for making a not-perfect CoD. I do like the game and enjoy it.  On my Sapphire 7850 it runs reallly smoothly! Optimization is indeed needed, really strange fps.  But, look at the bright side, it isn't as bad as blops 2. Quickscoping is not so popular, not crazy op guns/streaks/ perks (the assault streaks need a buff or a remake in my opinion). Really Balanced Multiplayer. (9/10)  Extinction is solid, but not crazy nice. It does need more maps and strange things like Zombies. They are similar, but extinction has a different feel. (8/10)  Singleplayer is playable with a somewhat strange storyline which didn't get me bored. (9/10)   Sure copying scenes is really unprofessional but let's hope they hear our comments and make the game better for the PC.  Overall (8/10), due to lack of optimization for pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great job on this, even though i'm not a CoD player i still think that CoD Has overcome themself's this time. This is a great game, still a bit of fixes here and there but still a nice game to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Campaign , awesome extinction , decent multiplayer as always but for the PC version graphics should have been much better ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For â€œmeâ€.. This seems to be the â€œBESTâ€ in the Call of Duty Series. There is so much new to examine while you still have the gameplay COD is known for. I like the features of â€œSquadsâ€ and find the multiplayer to work rather well even without dedicated servers. I would rather see dedicated servers to be honest, they should never had been moved to an after thought for PC players. Biggest mistake the franchise chose to do. Anyways.. The soldier build up is all new and works rather well. You now have a squad worth of soldiers that can also be leveled up and designed as you wish. Very interesting and look forward to more. Graphics are stunning when set to â€œExtraâ€ and all seems to run pretty smooth for â€œmeâ€. I didnâ€™t buy the expansion pack â€œyetâ€.. but most likely will.   I played Battlefield 4 for 5 days straight before this release. I have yet to load Battlefield since. People keep comparing the two titles although they do not play the same at all. Let us be honest here, they are both same old same old but refined for the better(we hope) each year. There are many ways to play these titles with known winning abilities in execution. I like ground pounding and COD offers that in spades. Battlefield is more of a Vehicle play although to me a bit arcadish in execution BF4 â€œdefuse modeâ€ is interesting and a take on Search and Destroy, my favorite type of play in these games. Ghost still has S&amp;D buried inside, however they are toting a new twist with Search and Rescue which allows the possibility of revival from a team mate. I never warmed to Blackops or Blackops 2 nor would I suggest them to others. This title though? Single player and Multiplayer get my nod.. nicely done with no patches yet.. can only get better.   Remember the minimum requirements folks.. you will need 6 gig of Memory (update: now 4) to get this running on the PC.. I would also suggest a 660 or better graphics card.. donâ€™t hate the game for this.. The bugs for â€œsomeâ€ seem to do with graphics and the minimum ram requirement. I have neither or any bug that can relate to my system. The â€œonlyâ€ bug I have seen is no mouse control left or right to change players you are spectating when dead in Search and Rescue games. I am sure they will fix that in a patch and does not really effect gameplay. I donâ€™t really have an Uber system either. I5 2500k, 16 gig ram, GTX670 card and RAID HD to SSD. I call it a basic medium system and specs.   Plenty of MP maps right at release and many ways to play. I have no choice but to like this game for what it is.. a winner. [GS] 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Mulitplayer sucks!!!!! The server forces you into maps that you absolutley hate to play, without giving a chance to say no. I that crap. It is very annoying"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Please save your money and time and DON'T buy this game. It is AIDS.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like bad graphics, mo-cap dogs, and Stephen Lang, this is the game for you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's a good game, needs more learning than any other COD but the PC port is very buggy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool game but it needs a lot of fixes!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, the people that says it's laggy obivously needs a pc update!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Where you can't have enough of dogs and fishes .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts Now this game has received a lot of hate. Even from me as I was one of the lucky buyers do be locked out because of a RAM restriction that would not let you play. Infinity Ward took there so called next gen game too serious. After a huge outcry of unhappy costumers and thousands of people wanting there money back they finally gave up and took the restriction out with a patch. The game is clearly not next gen and we were also lied about getting dedicated servers. Overall the release of the game was a mess.  Now for the Single-player. (SPOILER ALERT ) DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE CAMPAIGN  I have to say that I enjoyed this game very much for its story. At last we don't have a Russian or Middle East enemy or main villain. This game is set in an alternate timeline that has nothing to do with Modern Warfare or Black ops. This time the threat is from South America that joined forces and overcomes the world. I enjoyed this a lot since I speak Spanish and could understand all the stuff enemies talk about and scream when the fighting begins. The campaign is not the longest but it took me over 10 hours since I went and looked for all the secrets and also made it my mission to get all the achievements. It has some really nice missions not seen in a Call of Duty game. Underwater, in Space, and the use of a German Shepard. The game does look great and might appear next gen ,but that debatable. The overall story just sucked me in and I didn't have that feeling with Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3. Since this time its just from 1 point of view the story stayed interesting. The music is OK and the sound of guns are also a bit better that BO2. Overall I enjoyed this game very much and give it a personal 8 out of 10.  The Multiplayer.  Now this part has its ups and downs. No its not Battlefield its still Call of Duty. Fast run and gun action like we all love it. The maps are huge compared to the tennis court maps of MW3 and BO2. These maps actually change and move around. The gamplay is practically the same as any COD Multiplayer. New guns , new perks, new costumisation. They actually let you use a woman now for the Multiplayer. The games can be from great to unplayable. No dedicated servers!!! So sometimes the game can be smooth as silk or lag horrible. IW has not patched this game against hackers. So be aware! I play a lot against bots, that is a nice way to learn the maps and play against non cheaters I give the Multiplayer a 6 out of 10.  Co Op Modes.  Now this is what I loved the most In Ghost. There is a really great amount of modes. From survival modes to squad against squad. Fight against hordes of infected soldiers in co op. And the one that is my favorite. Extinction!! Yes its finally something else than zombies! This is an entire little story we you play solo or with friends fighting your way trough an invasion of aliens. its not just level after level its an entire little campaign were you have to get from a landing site to the core of the invasion. Its awesome and its nice to fight something different than Nazi Zombies. I give this part of the game a 9 out of 10.   If you like Call of Duty you will like this game(or hate). If you are new to the series I recommend Call of Duty 4:Modern Warfare which is still the best in my opinion.  Overall the rating for Ghost from me is a 7.5"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game but dont buy it!many cheaters and hacks!i want my money back or fix this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"like other toxic CoD games, but when you feel bored its good way to rewind time"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is nice
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Are there goanna be dlc 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is a great game, i know i will get haters but i have played it and i enjoyed it. the combat is as great as ever and the story even though it is cliche it is still intereting. the campaign has great action and pacing. the multiplayer has been given more modes with my favourite being infected. even though all the new modes arent that great this is an onverall great package and alot of content and i havent even talked about squads and extinction yet. overall if you like call of duty buy this you will not be dissapointed. 8.7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really good game, everyone just talks nonsense, and yeah i know my english sucks, but i dont care, i recommend this game for everyone, i have laptop with i3 and gtm 630 and it runs 60 frames on low graphics and 1366x768 with no lags and no crashes, you just need to update all your drivers, thats all, is that so hard to do that? mad kids just crying because game lags with 2010 drivers...  Best of cod games so far, graphics are really nice, interesting history sp, thats my opinion about this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game! Awesome graphic! Awesome Story! Love it! Except one thing! The end wasnt that good! Kinda got me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty may have picked up a reputation as one of the laziest, most callously developed cash cows in the business, but I've always believed that reputation was undeserved. Call of Duty: Ghosts, however, with its slapdash campaign and unambitious multiplayer, contains enough factory-standard cynicism to earn itself plenty of scorn. Nothing Ghosts does is especially bad, but nothing Ghosts does is worth paying any attention to. It exists to exist, a stopgap bit of filler spat out as the industry transitions from one generation of consoles to another.   This game should be archived as the sole representation of our entire existence and cast out into the cold reaches of space to show all life in the universe what mankind was created to make. It is a a masterpiece thousands of years in the making, combining all of our collective knowledge and resources to make this game. It is so great of an achievement of mankind that I call it a game only for the lack of a word that would properly describe this gift from god.  Contrary to the old saying, you can teach an old dog new tricks. Black Ops II demonstrated that with style. Ghosts, however, is a dog that simply doesn't want to change. It knows what it is, and sticks with it. It would be a respectable endeavor, if it didn't lead to such an underwhelming and predictable little product. What a sleepy, sleepy dog. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have seen a lot of negative reviews on this game. All I can say to those people is 'Upgrade your Rig'.  I have not had any trouble at all, no hesitations, freezing, etc. This game is Call of Duty on speed! It has amazing gameplay and sound, it is easy to lose track of time when you are playing.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game but a lot of the standard maps I don't like because they are way too big. The new DLC Onslaught comes with some really great and cozy maps so I really recommend buying it.  Also the game now comes with a FOV slider and VAC! :)  I give this game 4/5 whiskers and Onslaught DLC 5/5 whiskers!  Loads of &lt;3 from KnytetM!  Ps. Be brave, don't be a Camper Dave! Ds."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get it, Fun game, Graphics are amazing, Multiplayer A+++!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wasnt worth the $90 but squads is pretty good multiplayer need ALOT of patchs / updates. Very nice Campign does have alot of gun battle which i find boring but still a decent game that it has squads. XD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Currently unoptimized. It needs a very high-end PC to run on maximum graphical settings. Otherwise you'll get the old CoD.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is great i really liked it and i finished it in 4 hrs. :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dispite all the already expected hate and critisism this game got before and after launch from fanboys it was a spectacular game! even if its 'realism' in graphics wasn't on par with BF4 they were amazing and the visuals were stunning! the story line in this COD release is an instant snap in and major jump up from COD:MW MW2 and MW3. absolutly loved it and would recomend it to anyone who likes FPS and/or CoD! Infinity ward never fails to deliver.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My opinions have since changed from when I first wrote my COD Ghosts review, so, here it is.  IW actually got their balls back in place and fixed a lot of the PC issues. I started playing again on Saturday (Feb 1st) and whilist playing core TDM, I came across a hacked lobby. Left immediately, only to find out that since I played another game after that it saved me as a max prestige. Now everyone thinks I'm a cheater, and a waller, JUST BECAUSE I HAVE MAX PRESTIGE???  I don't want to download a hack to reset my stats because then that defeats the purpose of playing as I've unlocked a lot of things legit anyway. So that really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off.  To recap as to what I had said in my old review:  The game still has some minor lag issues Extinction only had one map at the start, while BO2 Zombies had like four (I mean tranzit was split up, but, extinction could have been somewhat like that) There's lots of cheaters Now I get called one when I did nothing wrong.  Back to Black Ops 2!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a fan of the Modern Warfare Series (F*ck Black Ops.), i found Ghosts to be a refreshing change of pace and setting the stage for many great additions to come. The levels all had a unique feel and added many unique ways to complete objectives with beautiful scenery and effects. Space segments and underwater parts were an amazing sight. Not one story mission was repetitive and they flowed together nicely. Each mission had its unique feel, while bringing something new and interesting to the table. The story was enjoyable and as always held my interest easily. I would like to see Rorke's side of the story, maybe in a DLC or something that would be a neat addition. And like always the voice acting is realistic and top notch, not voice over screaming like it's clones and wannabes.  Its not as great as MW3 or MW2, but as it's stand alone story/game I found it to be decent and has potential to overcome its predecessor. The only problem is they became lazy and jumped onto the zombies band wagon, when they could've stayed true to their own spin on things. Spec Ops is a fantastic addition in the previous installments, and I was deeply disappointed in not seeing it in Ghosts. They had unique levels that could easily make an amazing spec ops campaign making this the game to top all previous Call of Duties. Solid 7.5, they have room for improvement, but I have faith they will redeem themselves."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In all honesty:  This is the best COD since Modern Warfare 2. Most innovative maps since. Also extremely balanced gameplay, and great ideas. Optimizations definitely need to keep coming because its not very stable (as opposed to being a smooth trouble free game). The lack of both an effective anti-cheat system and dedicated servers is frustrating. The population is small because of this. Youll spend most of your time in lobbies waiting for people to join. The new Search and Rescue gametype is awesome and I'll never go back to regular hardcore Search and Destroy, which says alot because thats all I've played since COD4.   Kudos for the good game, and a Go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Yourself for not making it as playable and cheat free as it should be. -kRoOkEd"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is an amazing game. Only downside is just some graphics issues and also if you do not have a good PC it might lag, etc. Overall the campaign's storyline is good and the gameplay is amazing. Do have fun with the game if you have it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game.  The story makes sense, good graphics, and its overall amazing. Dont know why people hate it. I only play Call of Duty for the Campaign and this campaign was spiecal.  The multiplayer, well..... not so much."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Overall a reasonably good addition to the series. There are some minor technical problems that have to be dealth with initially because this game doesn't seem to be very well optimised for PC however this isn't to difficult to fix. The campaign is very varied with an interesting but still rather predictable plot. Multiplayer seems to have developed a lot recently which is saying something for a game which is constantly critised for being the same every year. It seems much more balanced than previous titles and in general all of the maps are good with great vertical gamelplay. The new squads and presitging system is rather interesting too and allows much more flexibility. Finally the additional game modes such as Extinction are also reasonably good though not quite up to the standard of Treyarch's Zombies. So to sum up it is a decent game, possibly not the best but a good game still that most people would enjoy playing."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I't's AMAZING!!! &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Have a good pc (like all pc gamers should) and this runs great on it. I recommend it!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awsome game, just there is too many hackers. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you have a pc as powerfull as mine then it would be perfect.The only problem is that since the last patch the multiplayer lags a lil sometimes.Still extinction works perfectly online.Also the singleplayer rocks.Its best played on an 8 Gb RAM and a good graphics card.To people with powerfull pc's i recommend playing it while connected to a big LED TV like a Sony or LG model.It provides perfect graphic effects if connected with HDMI cable on a tv equal or bigger than 42 inches. Enjoy it people!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think this game, its not really bad. (Sorry for my English, not my native language). Okay, has some issues, like fps drop, and some lag. But multiplayer is great, similar to MW2. In my opinion, the Extintion mode is better than zombies. So, its not the worst cod, but need some patch indeed. And squads mode, is very good, for novice players, for test weapons, or maps."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is amazing, im not sure what type of crack anyone who gives this game a bad review is smoking. The series has been pretty badass since PSX or so.....Plug and play basically.......I took a hiatus from the series, the last one i played regualary was COD4 modern warfare, I played the others on my friend ps3s and xbox 360s......Im super impressed, not a high investment of time learning to play, and you stand a pretty fair chance of killing even the highest of ranked and modded players. A few minor bugs, but the game has been out a month so wtf I trust this company to sort it out, and by the way I havent even played anything of the single player at all yet! If you want to get up and kill with alot of sweet weapons and explosives you will never be dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. you should pretty much quit gaming and immeadiately throw yourself off a cliff for the betterment of humanity if you dont enjoy this game. Gaming doesnt get much better than this so give up on the whole FPS genre if you are bored with this :D lol! P.S. If you arent intelligent enough to read the system requirments and ascertain wheter or not it will run on your system, you are again an IDIOT and that would be on you not the developer of this badass game!!!!! By the way, the people that dislike the storyline of the game, are the same people that find movies like transformes 2, the hangover 3, and mtv reality televison fascinating. #getaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥inglife#"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'll write a review that isn't made by some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that played only a few hours or minutes and didn't got used to the game on the first place or looked for fixes.  The campaign is a 'You either hate it or love it' deal. I found it to be good. MP is pretty balanced and there isn't anything that is seriously game breaking. Maps cater to different playstyles and guns instead of just the same old SMG spam rampant on older games.  The main problem is the port optimization. The game stutters and lags depending of the map and of your configurations. Image Quality must be always set to Extra for fixing most of the stuttering and memory leaks. FOV sliders aren't there, through. You'll find hackers often, but I have not seen one for a very long time.  So basically if you think you can go through the bad port optimization, the game is good. I'll say to not actually take advice from reviews here, since most of the reviewers usually bash on the game before even playing it. It's Call of Duty, the haters are worse than anything else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best game of the year in my opinion! Looks like I'm the only one without Optimization problems xD. Then again, I have the AMD R9 290x 4gb. :P. It's great!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,some good stuff! :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amesome Game! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game i loved the story to it, it was a complete twist to how they normally did it which made me not like the ending, but love it cause its new and very good in my opinion!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buy the Zakhaev character addon, turn your whole squad into him, enjoy squads."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really good game with a lot of improvements.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I know everone is like OHH this game sucks because of FPS Drops, DONT F***ing Blame the game for you having a s**t PC!!!! Its your own fault for not going to the settings and not putting the graphics down, BTW THERE ARE PLENTY OF GUIDES WHO SHOWS HOW TO GET GOOD FPS!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Improved Graphic, awesome controll )))"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another year, another Call of Duty. Infinity Ward / Activision managed to put a great amount of effort into delivering a fantastic multiplayer experience, but a very short and buggy singleplayer campaign, devoid of any good new ideas. What struck me was the writing, which - given that people from 'Traffic' were involved (and I liked that movie) - was nice, but should have been a lot tighter and more involving. You end up having a short singleplayer experience where you feel more pushed along for the ride than actually playing the game. But then again, it is great material to get you accustomed to the weapons for MP later. Ghosts is the perfect example of a video game status quo being maintained, both in the brilliant multiplayer, but also in the poor singleplayer experience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(Posted 2 Jan- )  I love Call of Duty, and always will, this story is.... Stunning, ITS AMAZING The minus is...: I have (apparantly??) a bad PC to play it on, i play MW2 in full graphic but cant do that on GHOSTS, but i easily forget the lil' lag there is in this game. Easy, i have played the Campaign for.. 3-4 hours straight now, if not more..  Could easily keep playing but i want to play something later :)  My opinion: Get a better PC (If you dont already have one.. lucky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.) and then buy this epic game,  (havent played the MultiPlayer yet, but im assure that it will be good.   (Edited 2 march )  I still like this game, Alot. When i bought it, there were around 15 000 players, now its around 4000.... Some gamemodes says 'No Games Found' (which is bad...) because there are no one playing it. I recomend this game!  I am a Swede."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hey guys this game is OK its not good its just OK it has a lot of problems just play it man its fun i guess
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A really good game that is fun with friends
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is such a great game! Love the new equipment but would like more game modes to be available like capture the flag.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In terms of graphics it is much better than Black Ops 2, has larger maps and explosives are no longer resupplied by scavenger in Multiplayer which is a Godsend. However they ave managed to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up the spawns even more than in Black Ops 2, even with larger maps to work with you still seem to spawn in the direct line of sight of other people, I once suffered a ten spawn-kill streak. Personally I think you should wait until they fix this problem."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good job infinity ward 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a Very good game. It's first days we're not so good, the game had a LOT of issues and other things. They are getting fixed, also, the next gen was right on the gaming community's neck, and the game was made for consoles rather than PC.   The story:The Campaign is Very good, the cinematics just BEATIFUL, and sometimes the audio lags for me (I don't know what happens with others) the game runs at a smooth 60 fps, the story telling is excellent. The space mission is AMAZING, very detailed, and very fun. The twist at the ending comes like a suprise, and I was not disappointed.The Rorke files put little pieces to the campaign, so you might wanna collect them.  The multiplayer/Extinction/Squads:The multiplayer is changed in a good way. You can select the head, the gender, the body and literally EVERYTHING. Squad points is a great feature, and the weapons are great.Extinction is a 4 player co-op mode, and it's same as Treyarch zombies, but better. Four classes, the weapon specialist, the tank, the engineer, and the medic. They are all important for survival. 6000 is the maximum cash you get, and there are challenges for each hive that can be completed and also failed (except the barrier hives). It's a fun gamemode. Squads is very good. You can also level up there, you can play Safeguard and etc.   This game deserves a 9/10.  Pros: -A very good storyline -Great storytellling -Descructible enviroment -Customizeble characters -Exctinction -Squads -Rorke files -Beatiful Cutscenes Cons: -Bad Graphics on Multiplayer -Crashes (Rarely happens for me)"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"OK, so I have now played both Battelfield 4 and COD:GHOSTS. And I must say I am beyond surprised at my conclusion that COD:G, at least from the single player campaign perspective, is better, in my opinion. The storyline is better, and I can't beleive I am going to say this, the visuals and graphics are better. It does have a steep system requirement but to tell you the truth so does BF4, they just don't say it out loud in the SYS REQ section on steam. Now, I can't speak to the multiplayer, as I am not much into PVP at all. But, I have played COD:G twice now and plan to play it a 3rd time on the difficult setting. I'm not saying BF4 is not a great game, it is, but for the money, COD:G is better. Or at least, if you plan to get both, start with COD:G."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After some patches and updates, Call of Duty Ghsts is a good game over all. At the beginning, there were stutters when you played and now there are none (atleast for me).  Cons: The major thing that I do not like about this game are the amount of people that camp. There have been so many times where my score has been compromised because people want to sit in one spot almost the entire game. (This ruis the entire game for me and makes me want to return this game. Atleast in Battlefield 3, you really don't have this problem.) Also, there is a lack of players online, which makes it harder to play other online modes such as Cranked and Blitz. Besides that, the only other flaw I see is the amount of hackers that play this game. You would think that Activision would have done something about this by now.   Pros: Your player is now more customizable now more then ever. You can now choose gender and what your player looks like. Along with this you can also choose which soldier you would like to be with the cost of some squad points which you earn while playing online. This is the same for upgrading and getting new weapons. I find spending squad points a pro because you gain squad points based on how you play. So the better you do the more squad points you get.  Overall, I would recommend this to a friend or anyone that likes to camp. If there were some way to fix this problem, then the game would be much better to play. Although I don't see how it is possible. I mean it's how we have snipers. But, I will say I would recommend this over Battlefield 4, which still doesn't work."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome Game, Cool Campaign. I recommend getting it, well done on the weapons, custom clothing. I think this game is worth it. It's better than all of its inheritence games. Thanks for making this game :P"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really good. I have so much fun with this game and all other peoples that say this game is bad have no idear because they had never played this game...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Despite seeing the bad mechanics from MW2 where people abused Commando perk and were able to knife you in the face while you were shooting them, this game has some good action in it. It is not as good as Black Ops 2, but you get to play some different maps.   I wish i could get a merged version of all call of duties into one, so i dont have to play Ghosts when i want to play Modern Warfare 3, just because nobody can be found for multiplayer in MW3."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This was The Last Great Cod Game before the serie turned into halo
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is honestly one of the best action FPS games I've played. It is simple yet visual, sometimes repetitive yet interesting, with an engaging story. Yes, long time Call of Duty fans may say it is more of the same. Personally I found that Black Ops and Black Ops II was sometimes tiring. Ghosts will take you even to space, with a very nice gameplay mechanic.  Did I say the game is visual? I couldn't say that enough. It does have some visual glitches on the latest update (and for you reading out there, you should just change the variable seta r_usePrebuiltSpotShadow from Enabled to Disabled on your config.cfg and config_mp.cfg files), but once you fix it it will look superb.  The one problem I see with this game is that it is short. You complete the story mode too fast. I am more of a single player, so I won't review the multi player part. But if you want to have a couple hours of fun, Ghosts deliver it."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts is like Mixed Mw3 &amp; Black Ops Put together. Personally really like the Free-Fall map that changes with environment of the map. I would rate this game 8/10.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gets alot of hate, but this game could/will be good once a few issues are ironed out. Mouse acceleration and performance being the two major issues.   8.9/10"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think this is the best Call Of Duty game I ever seen :) You have to buy that crazy game :P enjoy !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of duty ghosts isnt as bad as a lot of people are saying you just got to get use to the changes that have been put in the game. after you get past all the hackers it is a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Buy the Golden Adtion Its Got A Lot More Stuff For Same Price Trust Me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Best On Steam
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very higt grahisk my gtx 650 dont support but crysis 3 supporet! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ignore everybody elses rants about how this game is only half finished. Yes, it is terribly optimised, but providing you have the decent hardware required, it will fell no different to playing this game on a next gen console. Yes, you may have to turn the settings down, but the graphics are slightly on the s**t side anyway and you really dont notice as this game is so fast paced. That is only for the multiplayer however. On the Campaign, it runs smoothly at 60+ FPS on my Nvidia GTX 760 and AMD Quad Core CPU with the settings turned up to max. Im thoroughly enjoying the Multiplayer with my Xbox 360 controller as the Gamepad is integrated seamlessly. Extinction seems like a bit of a gimmick, but after a couple of rounds, I even found that to be quite ejoyable. Yes, if enjoy any previous COD, then you should buy this game, just make sure that you have the hardware to run it :)"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The good: Ghosts new formula of how you prestige, the squads, weapons/attachment slots etc... is a great combination.   The weapons are fairly well balanced, (better than both MW2 and MW3) save for the Bulldog shotty and M27-IAR LMG being far and above the best of their respective classes.   Most of the maps are fun to play and flow well, with the exception of a couple that are just a mess IMHO.   The customization options for the characters, including female characters, is a welcome change, and the operations to get the different camos, patches, headgear, etc... work well since the patch that no longer required that operation to be active to receive the bonus (before that patch, it wasn't worth the effort).   The bad: Rampant cheating that has not been addressed has yet again spoiled a fun and addicting game. When this game was launched, they promised a new game engine which ended up being a revised Quake engine, and there were already working hacks available the day of launch. Why you don't get a few people to review game footage of those with TDM KDR's above 3.0 and start banning them when they are found to be cheating is beyond me. It would take minimal investment and effort, and you would reap the benefits by making a fair playing field for all. The fact that less than a year after launch, you only have between 1,000 and 2,500 people playing is testament to the fact that everyone is sick of this garbage.   Matchmaking is not the greatest. Lag is an ongoing issue due to the large geographic dispersion of the lobbies, where a more localzed matchmaking formula would be much better than what is in effect now.  Conclusion: Dispite it's flaws, I play this game A LOT, so I guess I would recommend it. That being said, I will NOT be buying Advanced Warfare at launch due to the lack of the game developers dealing with cheaters. Deal with the cheaters, and I would not hesitate to buy it. Without support from the devs on the rampant cheating in every Modern Warfare game since MW2, I will be showing my displeasure with my wallet."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a pretty funny game, talking about multiplayer here, the extinction mode is just awesome.. somethink new that wasn't out before, when i first started playing, i didn't knew pretty much, but believe me, its the best mod i have ever played.. the extinction.. The single player.. hmm, its good too, i can say, i still didnt finished the single player, because i changed to multiplayer, i was enthusiasted to try the extinction mode.. but i had fun in single player too.. after all this is a multiplayer based game, all who buy this, they buy it for Mp.. especially, and its very fun.. you just need to have at least 4gb-6gb rams to run it smooth.. so you don't lagg so much and i assure that you will have fun in this game :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have to say i'm pretty impressed, but I can see the polygons way to easily and the guns are a little too strong, I think you need to nerf it, but all in all, great game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game. Give a thanks for IW.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why the hate? Good Story Mixed Campaign Good Game I like it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WHERE IS THE EFFIN FREE WINTER PACK??
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty ghosts is an amazing game! The graphics may not be the best, but the gameplay is dramtic, awesome and heart breaking! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves fps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A tremendous game at its best, The storyline is top notch and multiplayer is really fun. You must have some past experience in COD titles to be good at multiplayer tho. And the Co-Op extinction mode?! That's just really awesome!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly dont know where all the bad reviews come from for this game, other than kids with nothing better to do than troll on the internet, like they do 24/7 365. I digress, Ghosts multiplayer to me is better than black ops 2, feels more like the original blops to me! maybe not o all, but it does to me, reduced maximum helath, better weapon feel, better movement and environment feel, just like BLOPS 1. Just caught this on sale so i would def recommend buying it during this autumn sale for 14.99 that comes with the first DLC, too good to pass up, though if you are planning on buying this for $60, i would say you are crazy, and should probobly get your head checked. mostly because activision and places an absurd price on the old CoD games......BLOPS 1 is still like $40 regularly i think. so do not buy for full price, do like me and wait in the shadows for a good sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,12/10 best stealth simulator ive seen so far!  Like have you seen how I took down a hole sky scraper without being noticed. They really nailed the damn stealth idea.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why's everyone complaining. I really like the game. It works good on my PC and there's no hackers in multiplayer. I miss Zombies mode, but everything else is quite OK."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't purchase this pile of JUNK!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ghost it not a game I will recomend...sorry COD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its an amazing game,despite the hate but its too easy to beat the campaing"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Keep calm &amp; play COD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I write my opinion about this game again because my previous opinion was not detailed enough (and was not formulated correctly).  Many people did not like the COD GHOSTS because of many reasons but I personally liked it. His story is excellent. Excellent graphics. The multiplayer its nice and a lot of interesting things. I loved also the private match that can be added for bots and it's good for me because I have bad internet.  I recommend the game and is definitely worth its high price (as of 20/11/2014)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"swer on me mum ill noscope u 360 aimassist 1v1 club penguin   im de best, noob  xXx_N0SC0P3R-PR0-PR3D4T0R_xXx  add me on xbox live my gamertag ^     u xxx_f-g-t_xxx  rekt."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very fun game. Campain is solid...the multiplayer is pretty fun but could use some work.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Always loved all of CoD games. This would be my favourite. The Call Of Duty: Ghosts would be one of my top FPS PC games. Love it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In all this negative statmens i'll make a positiv one. it makes a lot of fun. i have a good pc and i dont have any laggs or buggs. i dont know what is going on with all the guys in here. the story is like all the other cod's full of action ,and it makes fun. the multiplayer is well...nothing revolutionary but it makes a lot of fun with the classic CoD gameplay. the customization is cool and get you a lot of new stuff. the alien-mode is pretty nice to play with friends and it makes lot of fun, it reminds me a lot of the left 4 dead gameplay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like Call of Duty and have a powerful system, get this. I wouldn't spend more than Â£20 though.  Pros: Enjoyable game as they have added Strikezone 24/7 Graphics are good  Some new guns are good Like the new perks   Cons: Bad port - Lag even with an easily capable system Bad maps (Strikezone is good though) Bad spawns Shotgun is way too overpowered Campaign cutscenes lagged - Didn't play more than 1 mission. Low amount of players online Prestige system is stupid - Different characters"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,For $15.00 this is pretty darn good. It doesn't lag on my computer Intel I7 4770cpu 3.4Ghz (8 cpus) GeForce GTX645 Runs fine on all settings. It's Call of Duty. Not groundbreaking but as good as any of them.  If you could accept just another version of COD and don't mind getting owned in MP (Just like all the other COD games) then for $15.00 I think you'll be happy enough. I can see why people who paid $60.00 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ though...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't understand why people hate this. My brother got this for christmas and at first...he said it was okay. So I played the campaign...I hate it. Played multi player a year later...okay...plays some more...This is pretty good! Like every call of duty game I come for multiplayer and give the campaign a chance, at first glance I just didn't see much like in BO2. After all, Campaign: 3/10. Multiplayer: 8/10. 7.2 total. Good game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I need to update my review again. This game is so good. I love the campaign. Multiplayer is semi okay.. but seriously. When it came out it was crap. it was not optimized to save it's life. started on xbox one and it sucked, pc was worse.. BUT if you look online how to fix some of the problems and make it playable.. it's rather enjoyable. The graphics are superb when you tweak them to the right way. My setup is i5 4690k, gtx 980, 16 gigs ram i play everything at top EXCEPT and I quote,'to get max performance, turn blur, distortion, depth of field, and change the filtereing to smax1. truly it looks great and plays perfect on campaign. multiplayer you needa turn some more off to work properly. I just wish people would quit giving it a hard time. sure, the campaign isn't 'absolutely original' well, thats fine because i liked it regardless, the underwater level? BREATHTAKING. im just overall in like with this game and as long as you get things set up properly. I recommend it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This GAME GOT SO AWESOME AFTER Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 ...... The WHOLE WORLD Plunged into A NEVER ENDING WORLD WAR 3 all because you killed Makarov in CODMW3 ending.  GOOD WORK ON THE GRAPHICS Guys. i didnt Buy This GAME Late on Purpose i wish i could of got This Game Before ANYONE Else in the world ; D   SUPER AWESOME GRAPHICS AND Story LINE..

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the best COD game that i have played thus far and the cost at $14.99 is a STEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,In very short I can tell this:  It is a cinematic ride that runs flawless!!! No matter what the people say in regard to comparisons to BF4. This game has almost no bugs and has a very good SP experience. The MP experience is just like the previous titles with better graphics.  For those that love MP and like the gameplay of MW3? This game is just for you! For those that love SP and love a cinematic ride.. This game is just for you!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well this is the best Call of Duty ever played in my life dont know what COD AW will be like  some people say Black Ops 2 is better . But I want to say with best graphics and gameplay and guns! Buy COD Ghost if you havent yet
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single-player: Like basically every Call Of Duty, the single-player portion is solid. The story is pretty long this time, around 8-9 hours and there's plenty of variation. But there's no story branching like in Black Ops 2, so in a way it's actually a step back. Since the story is about two brothers you can actually relate to them, more so than the previous games anyway. The game also ends with a nice cliffhanger. The graphics have been upgraded, but it's nothing game changing. Yes, the textures are sharper and there's more color, but it's still no Battlefield 4. In the end it looks like Infinity Ward played safe by not changing the formula too much. Treyarch has actually become the better developer between the two. At least they try to improve their games.  Multi-player: Terrible. The past COD games were way, way better. The connections suck, there's lag, giving other plays quite the advantage. The maps are dull, there's a lot of spawnkilling (spawnpoints were actually handled extremely well in the previous CODs) and the maps are too big. I hate it. Battlefield 4 has become my new multiplayer game for now, hell, even I was surprised it had to come to this.  I don't expect Infinity Ward to patch things, considering the patches they made for their other games (practically non-existent). Again, take a look at Treyarch, Infinity. Their games *work*.  In other words: Call Of Duty Ghosts is quite the disappointment.  [Rating: 84/100]"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I dont get why people don't like Call of Duty Ghosts?(i do have a picture of it but it doesnt mean i am a fanboy the mask is just cool)The story is not that bad honestly,although optimization is quite bad and i am suprised some bugs are not fixed 1 year later.The game is fun so if you want to buy it i would recommend it for you.Its just like cod 4 with bigger maps.You can also customize a character which is a nice touch to the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is grate but maps r to small bigger maps wood b better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game has slide, YOU CAN SLIDE.  10/10 next-gen fish physics."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!! Get It NOW!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I say that COD: Ghosts have good story and multiplayer but i dont like the graphics. Graphic is crappi :D  when i started the ghosts i turned all graphics to max and started to play a game but i didnt get the resoult what i expected. Game is worth to but so i recoomend COD: Ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a great game. It has singleplayer where you can follow the story. It has a Multiplayer where you can play against other people in various game mods. It has a mode called extinction where you play with 3 other people against the alien invasion. I recommend this game to everyone. It's worth 60â‚¬.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's the first FPS to feature Dogs, Sharks and Ghosts! That's right. Activision once again nailed it. Being way ahead of the curve knowing how players have been demanding doggy first person combat, fighting against great white sharks all the while being a ghost! No other developer can make this claim. And the hyperrealistic marketing is just the bonus flavoring."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game if you can put up with the server lag. Expected more out of the graphics being a newer game... Thank God I bought it 50% off on sale!... Not big on the Alien Extinction, but fun multiplayer... Vannila maps are getting kinda old... Overall its my favorite Arcade style game ;P"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the best versions of the franchise and has some best DLC maps so far. Great single player campaign and great multiplayer gameplay. Loads of multiplayer gametypes and modes, there's plenty for every level of player. 8.7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!! Get It NOW!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excellent Game, evrything in multiplayer stands out as being a top notch fps. I'd suggest anyone who doesn't like this game should upgrade their rig because it's obvious they are playing on a junk pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game needs a bit more work on it single plays is to short but still will play this again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I want a new laptop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why you all hates this game, for me, this is my favourite game, don't judge me !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I throughly enjoyed the storyline of Call of Duty Ghosts. I've played the Black Ops games as well and I enjoyed the variety in the missions from the usual first person shooter to driving tanks, flying choppers, space etc. It's setup for a sequel so we'll see if there is one coming."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,thumbs up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"awesome game, love the feel of it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can you unban me please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game! I really would recommend this to anyone wanting a great campaign, and good multiplayer. The campaingn was amazing, and i have played it multiple times. I dont really care that everyone else is saying it sucks, because in my opinion, the graphics are good, the story is amazing, and the multiplayer is really good too.  9/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Somewhat of a let down, however I still like the game. They nerfed sniping WAYY to much, however I do like the tatical slide and lean features. If someone were going to but this game I would tell them to wat a couple weeks for the new game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know what all the fuss about this game is, it's clearly another great CoD franchise game and people should not be discouredged from buying it. Great multyplayer, fast reflexiv game, complete opposite of the Battlefield franchise, that's why I like CoD more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you have a great PC with more then 4 RAM then i would recommend this game but only its Multiplayer because the Singleplayer isn't good like in all CoD's but the Extincion is very good aswell.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game but i cant wait for Advanced Warfare to come out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THis game is the best buy it I LOVE IT BUYY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is pertty fun u shoud get it  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game it's so good.. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best of the best 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The best first person shooter since 'Doom'. I haven't explored the multiplayer side of the game, but I have spent a good deal of time playing single player. The graphics flow, game sped, sound, player options, and overall feel are first rate. Well done!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is the 10th installment in the long-running Call of Duty franchise. This installment takes place after a catastrophic event leaves the United States and its military in a weakened state. A small squad of deadly killers known as the 'Ghosts' is ultimately tasked with the destruction of the Federation and restoring freedom to their homeland. While this game doesn't offer a vastly new experience over other titles in the series, Call of Duty: Ghosts is still a solid experience that manages to fulfill the various traits associated with typical action games. You can expect some solid gameplay, acceptable graphics and a continuously awesome multiplayer mode with this - plus, you get a badass alien invasion game mode. Gameplay consists of running, gunning, crouching, sliding, jumping, using your iron sights, and using some gadgets; everything works the way its supposed to, and firefights feel the way they should. If you've played any other Call of Duty titles before, you'll fall right into the familiar groove of sprinting and popping baddies with your assault rifle. The nice array of weapons and attachments allows you to go with varied loadouts unique to your playstyle; I especially liked the attention made to many of the new rifles included in this installment. The gun sounds (while unrealistic) sound extremely awesome in this game, as they are sufficiently loud/explosive enough to make you feel like a badass. The visuals in this game are somewhat inconistent and are rarely outstanding, however. Many levels in the game are the same murky-brown environments we've grown accustomed to in this genre; despite this, one or two levels that dared indulge in some greenery and varied landscapes actually looked quite beautiful thanks to the impressive lighting. The visuals are never terrible, it's just that they don't exactly rise to the standards of newer games like The Witcher and other impressive titles. The campaign mode, while quite short, offers everything you've come to expect from the franchise and will take you up to 10 hours to complete. The story and character development is completely disposable here, but the campaign is still a good 'tutorial' mode for new players. Call of Duty veterans should feel free to skip this mode completely. The Extinction game mode allows players to fight off waves of bug-like aliens in several different maps; this is a co-op experience where players have to destroy enemy nests using drills, all the while ensuring that the invading aliens don't get too close. While this mode isn't particularly inventive, I thought it was a good bit of fun to enjoy with friends. The Multiplayer mode is still your standard fare, and will definitely entice veterans of the franchise. The usual unlocks, levelling up system and customisation options are still here, and the addition of new game modes is certainly a welcome change. Nothing particularly new here, but it still feels fun to play if you enjoyed previous Call of Duty titles. Overall, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a solid title despite its lack of innovation. If you enjoy Call of Duty or are looking for a decent multiplayer game, you might consider picking this up for $20 in a sale. If you have grown tired of the franchise, however, you would not enjoy this game as it offers little change over previous titles. A good romp to enjoy by yourself or with friends! 7.5 / 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very cool game. I play it a lot. I recommend it to everyone ! :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very fun, but this game does crash a fair amount on PC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fantastic multiplayer, intense single player, good game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is awesome but now no one plays it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the story is good, which is u will feel that you really2 will hate the protagonist, i give it 90%.  the multiplayer is great! but it will make you 30% happy, 70% rage...  if you a true fan of CoD series I recommend this game..  But if you're not the fan.. Plz dont buy it. If you're not a fan, or maybe you really2 wanted to play it, dont buy it on full price. you will regret it...  9/10 would rage again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is awesome but now no one plays it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Highly under rated game ep can suck it multiplayer is great well thought out intricate maps great graphics 2560x1440 i like it better than battlefield 4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a good game and i have a very goood friends :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very fun! Call of Duty is good again. Super short though. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but singleplayer is great."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a very cool game! It is best game never!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is way too short!!!!!!! Its great but campaign is WAY TOO SHORT!!! You pay over $50 for a game you expect more than 8hrs of campaign! I recommend this to COD die-hards..... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game but vac banned for nothing -.-
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game what more to say 20/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty ghost on pc is dead but who cares about pc players i'm writeing review bases on xbox 360 and xbox one gameplay since its still being played more and let me tell its the best so far. No wall jumping or easy kills this game is actually fun and i don't enjoy call of duty games that much. Black ops 3 is a big diaster although its super easy to get kills that game takes no skill at all. Advance warefare well that game died out in the first 2 moth lol. Ghost is the last call of duty to be considered a normal game but imho call of duty 2 and call of duty 3 are the best in series cause it takes skill there was no kill streak,perks or special guns needed it was about good old fashion fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts, I've played it for about 13hours (Multiplayer) and I've enjoyed it so far, real fun and face paces.  Ghosts bring me back to Black Ops I, how you have to buy the weapons by getting points, back at Black Ops I it was using Wager to get weapons so on, but now at Ghosts the give you squad point, getting points by ranking up or doing other thinks within' the match, headshots, completing a field order and etc....  There is some problem within' the game stutters, lag, freezes within' the beginning of the game  Love the guns, they put in alot of different type of gun in new on old ones, really fun to use, also added new perks so as attachment.  I've enjoyed Call of Duty: Ghosts so far, if your a real fan of the Call of Duty franchise I would recommend you to try Ghosts yourself.  But I still wish that the graphics could be better.  Overall rating from me would be about.... 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Genuinely not that bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 can get snoop dogg announcer

Call of Duty: Ghosts,when can i start to play ?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Out of all the other Call of Duty games I've played, this by far is among my top personal favorite along with Black Ops! The campaign is amazing and very well developed. Not in a long time, since Call of Duty Black Ops, have I received such an epic feel when playing through the missions and experiencing the epic cut-scenes. It feels great to start a Call of Duty campaign with a different and fresh plot, along with new characters, much like the story from Call of Duty 4 Modern Wafare. The Multiplayer is excellent! The character customization is the best part for people like me, and the squad concept makes it better! The maps are good and the weapons and perk system is great and well balanced.  The game deserves great attention, and fans like me, honestly appreciate this game and the developers for their hard work. Again, this game is amazing and the campaign of the game is my favorite aspect. I am very much excited and looking foward to the sequel!  'Legends Never Die. The Ghosts are real.' 9.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As always it's just another 'COD Series'. It was good game play and and decent graphics (For a next Gen-Console Game). I won't completely bash the game. It was fun and I did enjoy playing. The story line wasn't bad and the end shocked me.. then kept me wondering whats next. I sat threw the credits and to my surprise there was a 10-30sec game play that makes you think.. 'humm'. Over all I would recommend the game to play. I do like the online play. Even tho it took the COD series countless games to start to figure out what the player wants. I also think the different game modes (Squads, Common Multi-player, and Extinction) are a good add to the game. I enjoy Extinction, even tho its not Zombies from Black Ops. It certainly has a feel like that. The set up for the players is good better then most of the last's. But as everything it has flaws. I do recommend the game and give it a go. What the worst that could happen?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This I liked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I went into this game with very very low expectations however infinityward have surprised me. The multiplayer gameplay feels fantastic and the equipment you are given at the start is actually useful so higher ranking players are not overkill against new players. Hip firing also seems to result in much more missing so you actually have to aim to be accurate rather than people running around constantly shooting.  overall really good game and may finally be a CoD game I enjoy as much as CoD4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really enjoy Call Of Duty Ghosts. The story was interesting and kept my attention. The game play and levels are amazing, fighting in space is awesome! :)  The Multiplayer is still fun as always. It is a lot different from Black Ops 2, it takes a bit of time to get used to the new features and set up. One thing I'd like to see improve is more of a notification on when you get SP.   Game runs smooth on my computer and It's 5 years old. No lag issues, I have the odd connection issue with the server, but that goes away after 2nd attempt.   Can't wait for more in these new series :)  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Definatly regreted buying this. the gameplay is awesome but when ever i play for minimum of 5 minutes my computer crashes 1st time it got the blue screen of death 2nd time a red screen and an annoying sound and all the other times just a blackout on my screen and then my computer crashes. anyone who could help me i would be gratefull  My PC specs are  Processer  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHZ z 3.00 GHz RAM - 8.00 GB System type - 64 bit system Graphics card - GTX 660 Nvidea Graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,soo much hate on this game but not that bad action packed not for those who are looking for a simple shooter pick up and play its fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is Amazing you will not play a better game best multiplayer of all the Call of dutys and best singleplayer ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is the best. I'm hooked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great singleplayer, with traditional epic moments. I have no problem with scripted events, as long as those events look good and aren't overused."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was a huge fan of mw3.. Even though there was the casual bad spawn points and op'ed weps..  But this game.. Do not buy it..  I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.. You start at rank 1 and have to fight ur way up in ordrer to unlock perks weps and a lot of other things.. But compared to mw3. This game is taking ages.. Ur a damn meat shield until you get certain perks which is not unlocked before rank 30..  This game is totally not worth it, and I greatly regret buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far this is the best call of duty I have played and I'm really glad that it was made by infinity ward as modern warfare and modern warfare 2 were really good. I love the new effects, and movement in game like peeping round cover. I also love the campaign and how good it is as I didn't think black ops 2 was that good. I would give this game a 5* and would recommend it to everyone. Ignore what everyone is saying, I havent had any problems running it on my laptop and I can even run it on high. I have not experienced any bugs or framerate drops and would like to say that this game does look nice it just helps if your not running it on the lowest settings, but even then its still just as fun, so go buy it its an amazing game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game isnt as bad as everyone says it is. Neither is it great. Multiplayer is fun and has a lot of new customizable features. Personally I think the campaign story is really good. Its a lot more tactical and the achievements are pretty easy to obtain. To get the best experience you have to try out different graphic settings and change your play style. After playing multiplayer and the campaign id say go ahead and buy the game but also dont expect a flawless next-gen game. Most importantly..HAVE PATIENCE!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Call of Duty has done a lot to restore my faith in the franchise. It still needs a few things: More destructable environments, more balanced and cerebral multiplayer experience, etc. That being said the single player mode is fantastic, and many of the new multiplayer modes are quite enjoyable, especially Extinction!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I should have gotten the xbox version. At most, there may be 5,000 players total online for multiplayer. The hacking is horrible as well. It seams like every game, someone has a hack. Single player was not bad. Although there are some parts where there was lag, or fps drops, the content and storyline of the single player game does get an A.   I do recommend the game, but if you are looking to play multuplayer, like almost everyone, go with a different console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome storyline and gameplay!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wait until it goes on sale for at least half price ... then you'll get some value for your spend ... overall, disappointing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,s'aight
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Brilliant game and well balanced. No one gun is over powered. Choose one that suits your playstyle. Excellent work!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alot of people like to dis the game but it is actually a really fun an addicting game if you take out the hackers and patch a few bugs but really how many games are perfect these days?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, only downside is just the lag on multiplayer, but mangable, totally worth it in the end."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,frezzes alot in campain video shots. laggs on mulitplayer. other than that its the best game ever made by call of duty 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well executed single-player and a well executed multi-player. There are few games out there that offer these kinds of thrills and spills. Only reason its not a 9 is the lack of optimisation for the PC version and bugs which persist 10 days post release; that said the PC version is the best looking of all of the versions (of course). Suspect the negative reviews don't reflect reality for PC gamers.  Its Fun, its big.. and its worth the dosh."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"At first, I was very upset with this game, trying to run it on max settings, worked, but was a little laggy. So after moving the settings down a bit, I started to enjoy the game. The multi-player was kind of disapointing, After playing Battelfield 4 and then playing this, it was very sad... After playing some of the Single player story, I started to really like the game, so far, so good. After playing for a bit I started up and Extinction game, the new 'zombie' style game, I played solo, and was very happy about it, was not bad at all. The customization for the characters is nice, but most all of it has to be unlocked, so dont expect to have your character looking how u want right from the start. I WOULD recomend this game to all of those FPS fans out there, UNLESS you dont own Battlefield 4, I would buy that over this, if you can only get one of the games. Other than that, COD Ghosts is worth owning. My rating so far, 7.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Game! Though they need to fix the llag in this game, not server lag, but performance. I have a GT 740m which is a great and cheap graphics card, but I can only run at Normal Image quality and High Textures. Then you're thinking, High? Damn that's good! But I literally turned everything off like Depth of Field, FXAA, And all that.... I would very reccomend this game for anyone who wants a great multiplayer experience and cool gamemodes like Extinction."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good multiplayer and a decent, short campaign"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A game there is combinated with nearly all call of duty modern warfare games. like from here. :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is good. I enjoyed it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Verry glitchy... But i know this game will consume alot of my time /)(^3^)(\
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"hit my wallet upgrading specs on the pc i think everyone can agree to some degree, in respect to what the game became. having said that all in all a good cod game. it was ghost or bo 2. having played mw 2 and 3 ghost did a good job however, cheeky with the dlc guns.. alright single player.. mp: mayhem and no tactics, which is good and bad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game must have received a lower score due to bugs in the early release version. I was late to play it, and what I experienced was a superb, albeit somewhat short, Call of Duty game. The graphics were beautiful. The gameplay was diverse and consistently captivating, and the storyline was engaging. As first person shooters go, I'd have to give it an easy 9 out of 10. I bought it on sale, but it was worth every penny."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"7/10 short review I don't understand why people hate it so much just because it's not different from the preceeding games, I mean it's still CoD, if you want something different then play another game. yes it doesn't require team work and is full of campers .. but thats how CoD i has always been... and a good player doesn't complain that much about campers  Detailed review Pros: -it was $15 during the black friday sale -the single player story is nice -cutscenes and voice acting are great -you can play as a female in MP if you want Cons: -min specs for the game is so demanding -MP maps are not well designed like other CoDs -the dog is overpowered -I had to do alot of research to overcome issues with the game (FPS drop, Lag, launch fail...etc) -doesn't have alot of players online .. but you can find a game in a minute or two  My advice: Buy the game if it's on sale for a good price $20 max  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i think this game needs more skillcap than others CoDs, this cod has good graphics and is fun to play"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game takes a while to get into it though
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i recommend this it is amazing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Loved the single player, multiplayer needs some work tho."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"nice game, only a bit laggy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OMG! this game! I just finished the Single player and im going crazy! What happens to Logan huh?!? Gaaaah! This one is better that MW3 by far and i love it so much! Cant wait to dive into the Multiplayer and see what's new.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its a good game, thanks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,U want to see your 40gigs of HDD back ? then this is the right game for you.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i would only recommend this game for the single player, as for me the multiplayer is laggy? or my fps drops all the time. allthough i didnt seem to have that problem in single player. i also would wait for it to go on sale before buying. o online multiplayer has at most 600 pople on at one time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player game is much better then Blackops 2, but the game seems to suffer from random crashes and slow down during narative cut sceens. Also i always felt like my character was still too short even when not in the crouched position, and although i can appreciate that he is carrying a heavy gun, my grandmother can walk faster then this guy! Otherwise, everything else is A OK."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Today i learned how big of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my mom is, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing every 12 year old that playes COD"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am really enjoying it.   As always I think all Call of Duty games will really just be extra missions and a new story line I have always like them.   
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good old Steam they somehow lost the Autorun exe. File ..This game will no longer work....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Squad play is a blast!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why am i vac banned i never hacked please if you benned me i want the evidence and i want unban 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have not played this game online yet. So I can't put a review of the online gameplay. I donâ€™t understand why this game gets so many bad reviews. Maybe the online isn't very good, it will be patched soon enough.  However I found that the campaign is extremely good. I am loving every minute of it. My favourite mission of the campaign is mission 7. Stunning visuals, exciting from start to finish, put me on the edge of the seat, cool guns and equipment. It reminded me of splinter cell but youâ€™re with a group and not on your own. I Loved it, considering replaying that part over and over. XD  Moving on, the graphics on this game are alright, they are not the best but all the COD games aren't huge with the graphics side. I have an i7 4770k and a GTX 560ti 448 cores and it runs around 40 - 50 fps @1080p. There is a review here saying they only get 20fps on COD but 60fps in battlefield 4 on ultra. I donâ€™t know what has happened there, but battlefield 4 destroys my PC. I only get 3fps on ultra which is totally unplayable.  Conclusion, I would recommend this game. I think the campaign is brilliant."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fun game to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"love teh game requirements just a little high ,but overall a very good game,maps a little to big ,glad that the lag and the servers are fixed ..where can i download the free festive personalization pack"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game !!! but we need more players :( 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was ok, despite the fact that it ripped scenes from nearly every other Call of Duty ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well worth Iit to wait
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's really fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Story Mode bad Multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,CoD Ghosts is on of the best CoDs in my opinion 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, love all the maps and weapons and the endless character custonisation options! 10/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best game i have play ever :):):) 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game. First did not know what is the best tactics to win, but after some rounds and experiments I win lot of Squard matches step by step"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really like this game its just that i dont like when people are hacking.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i like it because it is an rade game even though i die in the game, it sure makes things fun. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How to play 'Call of Duty: Ghost' Step one: download the game Step two: install the game Step three: play the game Step four: Un-install the game Step five: never play again  1337/420 would eat doritos and drink mountain dew again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Edit: Finally, the bug was about crashing with current nvidia driver. Downgrading it helped me able to play them.  When it comes to story, it is the second best of cod series. I hope they fix the problem soon or i wont buy any cod series. Looking forward to play Ghosts 2 if there will be one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool game love it &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game performance sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think the game is cool 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's good but it still needs a lot of work to be done to it to be very good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not a bad game,classic cod"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yeah but sort the lag out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Of all the games I have purchased this is the most unique I believed that the unlock system would be a bit like MEMP however i was incorrecxt and this proved annoying however i do enjoy the plot lines of the campaign overall it is a great game if i could stop getting spawn killed
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game Good Campaign Keeps you on the edge for the next game from IW Not very good from IW For PC Users because they made us use 6gb of RAM But the patch changed that and now its all good no bugs anymore good happy and will keep buying Call Of Duty's
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"100% GOTY. First you are an astronaut,then you are a frogman then you drive a tank. It's really refreshing and original. I was running around shooting people, next minute I was on a helicopter with a minigun. But you have to watch it because they get really hot and you are not allowed to shoot anymore. So I took it easy. There is a bar which gets all red and shows you how hot it is getting. I generally let it get like 75% of the way and then I stop for a bit. It's a pain but it's pretty much realistic. I talked to a soldier once at Someplace Else in the city and he confirmed that you can't shoot a real gun forever, which is pretty much what I had expected. Kudos to Infinity Ward for taking the high road on that one. Anything less would be an insult to the real operators that keep us safe in our beds at night time. But I did not like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dog. I am not an alsatian fan . They are an oily dog and the smell gets on everything (especially couches)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, but if you play multiplayer be prepared for hackers and people who have no lives that play this game religiously. You will lose constantly. I still enjoy playing though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hey gay please add me ..â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really Like the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It 's a very good game. If you don't like this game , get a BETTER SYSTEM."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a lot of fun. When playing the game you have to have a good computer. It would been really fun to play with a bunch of friends.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same addictive gameplay as previous series with better graphics. Call of Duty Fans should not miss out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awsome game, but lot of campers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Biggest flop in call of duty!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome Multiplayer. Cliche but amusing single player
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great graphics, but feels clunky in the multiplayer game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"LIKE THE GAME,BUT DIRECT X 11 NOT WORKINH! HOWDO I GET IT FIXED? "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Firstly this game overall has potential to be good but...  The multiplayer is crap and usually there is no one even on the servers. They also take forever to load or even match you to a server. If they fixed the server issues it might be better  The single player mode is great. The story is decent and you can play as a dog (Awesome)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a competive gamer that played alot of FPS and have played in about 50 lans over the years i thought to give cod ghost a chance. I have played alot of Q1 Q3a quakelive but also warcraft 2 starcraft and starcraft 2.  So is cod ghost a game that can be used in esport. Quite simply my answer is no.  What reasons?  1. the game doenst seem to be in real time. What i mean is i shoot at people i see myself shoot 3-4 times. I die, In the kill cam i do not get one shot of. There a a few vods on youtube demonstrating this. That player a see opponent for 12 frames and wins. player b only has 5 frames and dies while they are in direct vision with each other. Can you imagine quakecon finals Evil vs Rapha and the game is not in sync? Its unbelieveble that this is possible never had this with other fps games. There even vods on youtube where you look one direction. Suddenly opponent appears not around the corner but already 2-3-4 meter in open sight. While you are focused on looking at that corner.  2. No ping, you have a clanwar lets say you equal to each other but you cannot check if a server has fair ping. No point in playing ping matters. even in public with the random changing of servers one game you go 40-1 next game you go 20-10 cause ping changed.  3. FPS no way to measure fps or to go above fixed amount. Discussed quite alot on the forums. Its widely accepted in quake community that 125 fps constant is a standard for proper play.  4. I have a computer where I spend 2700 euro on. Top of the line. I can play with max settings. But you do not want to play with max settings as its very hard to see your opponent then. You are forced to use low settings in order to make it playeble.  5. Rushing in this game is possible vs noobs but vs equal opponents you die easy defenders bonus is huge.  6. Every weapon so strong you die very fast. if first 3 points where no issue maybe this would be okay but with al the issues its makes the gameplay bad and frustating.  7.You cannot spectate a game you will be kicked for being idle. after about 1 min.  8. Community not able to make there own maps. I even got e-mail for IW saying they made new cool maps please pay 16 euro and you have 3 extra map possible to play in multiplayer. I mean WTF? IW you serious?  9. Game is designed for Consule there is a sort of skill cap that is reached fast. very beginner friendly perhaps explain populairty?  10. 65 fixed fov. just LOL. you need to download a 3rd party program to get bigger fov how uniteresed in esports most IW be to do this?  11. Auto joining severs. And auto rejoining other servers while playing. I want to be able to scroll in what server to join. I want to see ping and i want to see what players on that server are they any good or not? quakelive has such a good function for this.  12. I loved it when playing i could go to spec mode. I find someone better then myself. I like to see how he plays usually duels but also could be tdm or ca i spec and look how he plays see what decision he makes. not a possibility in cod ghost.  13. Dieing doenst give you a disadvandtedge in the game you just spawn with full health and full ammo and your primary weapon. there is no farming of weapons or armor in the game. Ofcourse this is a cod ghost and makes it more noob friendly. I remember how much you had to play in team games in my old q1 and q3 clans to lock down a map properly control the main weapons control the armors. Know where the spawns are it was magic when you locked map down and went on kill spree. Opponent really had to play smart and take over area's one by one to get back in the game.   14. No duel. But in cod whats the point to it. without any of the farming element.   15. Is it me only or do bullets make no sense. I can stand behind stone wall and bullets pass. I stand behind a tree and bullets cannot pass. It seems very random in how bullets penetrate wall elements. On top of this the same wall in an other map bullets dont go trough so this should be standardisded.   16. Cheaters my god there alot of them. There players i reported 3 weeks ago that i see shooting trough 3 buildings on far side of the map killing people. Going 60-0 in a TDM match having K/D ratios of 30+ I reported these people as there is a function in there you can do it what i thought was really cool. 3 weeks later i see the same person still doing it being in top 100 of the ladder by now. IW doenst seem to do anything with the reports.   17. Connectivity issues. Sometimes you can play 4 hours not disconnects. Then suddenly 1 or 2 hours longs you just disconnect after playing a minute or so in the game.  Is the game fun to play?  I thought it was fun for about the first 100 hours of multiplayer till above issues where clear to me and started to anoy me to much to enjoy the game. I think IW should look how to make a proper FPS game and look at ID Software and creators of half life.  Anyways i am back to playing starcraft 2 and quakelive. I hope there is a game devolper out there willing to make a new proper FPS game that is fast paced like quake. Designed with the goal of multiplayer and esports.   Update. 29-6  Somehow i keep playing this game. Fortunantly the lag, fps and drops have been fixed. Gameplay is strangely atracting me:) Still alot of thing can be improved to make it better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its just like all the others............
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Looks like it's going to take some time to get used to. I hate the first set of weapons when beginning the game. Some of the maps are too large...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game just needs more players is all
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you like sitting in one place with a sniper rifle you will do well. The verdict is still out in my opinion. The DX 11 requirement meant I had to upgrade my graphics card to play. That may be one of the reasons the number of PC players seems low. Smaller maps for multiplayer deathmatch would improve my enjoyment. I recommend with reservations.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game full of cheaters,who are allowed to play.Really,do something about this thing cause people bought this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to enjoy game not to be scammed and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed by minority of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.Players getting tired of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t wont buy it again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game Rocks ! The Campaign was a bit short but the graphics are awesome and you can spend hours looking at the detail terrain and objects. Well done to the development team !!   Where the true fun is though, is the multiplayer. Team Death Match (as always !) is highly recommended. Awesome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This COD game is rough, and requires the top end of video cards, beyond what the game calls for in terms of minuim requirements, that I am sure of. Hopefully with a few more patches it will get smoothed out and then it could be one of the better one's in the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Glitched. So much glitches to an average game. I use an i5 processor with HD 7770 GPU and all other requirements on more than recommended. There are times it hangs in-game or even just on the main menu. It does not happen a lot. What happens a lot is the texture glitches that block out the entire screen in-game which disappears if I switch weapons. It's so frustrating especially when I'm using my favorite weapons and it wont' go out unless I restart the game. It also happens on multiplayer, which using your favorite weapon is very important and almost half of my deaths occur because of it. Couple that with common multiplayer CoD glitches like you die even if you shot first, some shooting accuracy issues, etc. It's so unfair. But otherwise, it's classic CoD fun when it works. meaning the biggest change is you have a dog. And I just lost more than $60 because I bought it retail on my own country. I do recommend this game if you can stomach all my gripes. It's still fun, but with much more frustration and some excitement lost. It's playable but I can't help but wish I could have my money back to buy Battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is pretty good I would say 6.5/10. But don't buy this game for multiplayer it lacks a player base.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont like that this game takes a lot of space!  I like this game cause it has hecka good guns!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think is the best cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game. Not so many cheaters anymore. I would recommend it !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was very good, except for the graphics but I don't think you could do any thing about that at the time and I am looking forward to Call of Duty Ghosts 2. (I am talking about the campaign when I rate this game) rate: 4/5"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Could of been a lot better. Not may people play becasue of preformance issues at launch and Feild of View setting locked. Black Ops II smokes Ghost. You paid for map packs and are unable play becasue the game is dead most of the time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Loved everything about the game. The story, the weapons...Riley (heheh). Graphics were low quality and the game lagged a little; but I'm using an older computer, so I won't complain. On a scale of 1 to 10 overall, I give it a 9!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"what can i say, it's awesome! way better then the story mode, keeps you on edge the hole time the match is going!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The BEST! Bar none!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really stupid all of them !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of my favorite storylines in a CoD game aside from the fact that the 2 main characters and antagonist are practically terminators.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OK So after nearly 100 hours on this game and a GPU upgrade i am able to say this game is indeed amazing but it still has lagg issues and graphical bug pop up every so often but apart from that the game is amazing and i give this a full thumbs up. (i will be giving my feedback on COD : AW after i reach 95 - 100 hours of gameplay
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing multiplayer! For now on I am getting any up coming Call of Dutys like Advanced Warfare. Might have a little bad graphics in Ghost but overall it will be worth buying because of the multiplayer! So many weapons and gear to choose from after you complete the challenges. This is a amazing game and you should buy it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is fun and will be worth the $$$ once they patch it as it can go from fun to really buggy. Campaigne is solid, online can get better. They need to allow server selection rather then randomized game search as it places you in rooms with people many levels ahead.  Recommend to wait for a sale, which rarely happens with CoD, or once they update and patch the PC port."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It has its problems but if you're a COD fan, its got everything you want.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hell yea awesome game its a but buggy but still very awesome guys adn gals
Call of Duty: Ghosts,My PC runs this game totally fine and I have never had a problem with it. It's ok if your PC spec isn't up to it but don't blame the game for hardware shortcommings.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"mint but needs some issues sorting regarding changing NAT,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it sucks when you first start playing but once you play for a while it grows on you its another cod game all i can say
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fantastic game. If you are a true PC gamer and you have the right system you will not experience a problem with this game! At the start of the campaign i experienced significant lag, but a quick restart solved that problem :)  A must buy but CHECK THE SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Takes a bit of getting used to the feel of the game, but so far its enjoyable. Dont like the glitches, cant run two graphics cards as you get flickering on sights, bit of a bummer. And yes some have already got their new HACKS and are annoying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,GAME SUCKS hackers cheaters every where...... if i was u buy Battlefield 4 MUCH BETTER GAME BETTER SURPORT THEN COD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the more complete Call of Duty experiences. Yes, ultimately it's more of the same but that's what makes it a CoD game. Enjoyable single player experience, great co-op modes and some fantastic maps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty is call of duty its a great game no matter what people say, it'll always be my favorite FPS"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Though I thought the game it self was too short I still enjoyed especially the tank levels.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"yes, its a well thought out game with lots of things to pick from.the only down side is the ammount of people playing..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like it. Have no particular loyalty to either CoD or Battlefield. Dont have a long history of either. So as games go, this is great. Especially like squads. Aint got enough friends to make a clan :o( But its all there, a shortish campaign, Clans, Squads and Multiplayer. Not fussed on the alien game, but may try it again another time.  So yes, I recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts adds another hit to the franchise. It has improved graphics and a slightly improved multiplayer component. It would have been nice for the game to ship with more multiplayer maps. The singleplayer campaign is average for a Call of Duty game. If I had to pick a score out of 10 I'd give the game a 9/10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITs a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how can i download the festive DLC?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game. But they badly need to put dedicated severs. Its about time already.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the DLC'S a acuialy very good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty's so geeewdd
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's not actually that bad, the weapons are all pretty balanced and the maps are decent"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like the game but it is so laggy any tips to change thst
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a nice game but..... MOdern Warfare is much more better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a killer game good graphix and good multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun Gameplay, Good Story."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game but do not play it all the time like alot of people
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the worst optimized COD to date. The multiplayer is pretty fun, if you can get it to run."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome campain the multiplayer is OK but it is a great game highly recamend it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you've played any of the call of duty games then this game won't seem like anything new...However, if you enjoy playing the cod series then you will like it...Great weapons. Could be a bit better optimized for PC but still delivers the goods.. Found this game to be much more enjoyable with a lobby of good friend/players...Be careful though..A few 'hacked lobbies' have created false VAC bans on some players that do not cheat and Activision and infinity ward won't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it, or state why, or give proof of the infraction. Although I know many have cheated and been caught, which we do applaud, some players have been thrown in hacked lobbies and paid the price later with a Ban..beware.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,was good for like 12 minutes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game! Run's awesome on my GTX 780Ti '60fps @1440p
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excuse me, i bought cod ghost: gold edition. I love the game so far but i havent got my onslaught dlc or my wolf skin please explain how i can get this or can i be givin this thank you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Game has Had its problems During Launch just like many othe Big Titles, how ever Infinity Ward have Done A Really Good Job To patch This, post in Campaign and multiplayer, i havent played much of the campaign but of what i did play, was very good, now we can all Debate on if this is realy a next gen game or is it any different from CoD's previus game how ever it doesent matter the game is getting stale, but not only that the mechanic/netcode is broken like crazy in this version and isnt helping with sales with the game, it is also taking the skill and fun out of the game, ovbiously on the campaign it doesent really play a big factor but its noticeable, on multiplayer is where it is really noticeable and even the most hardcore CoD Fans Are Saying previus games Were Better Than this one and i would Agree with them, this game needs a Solid Patch To Fix Everything, and then just maybe this game can be called a Classic CoD Game cas it isn't one at the moment, it is playable unlike it's largest Competitor Being BF4 as of 13/12/2013 how ever both game have their Problems. I would reccomend this game if its ever on this years holiday sale but as of yet, their are still too many issues with the game to be paying full price for it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Outstanding game, I love it...BUT...it's extremely difficult to get into any game under 'hardcore'....Im not sure if it has something to do with filters or what. I have waited almost an hour just to get into a room. I'm still figuring out alot of stuff...I would love to get into one of the new style games under 'standard' like 'hunt' or 'hunted' or whatever its called...I just cant figure out how. The graphics are excellent, sound is unmatched in any game I have ever played. The single player was a little.........short, for lack of a better word. I love the idea of buying weapons and equipment before you unlock it. Which ever one of you guys came up with that....well done, it allows you to get bits and pieces to help your style without letting you get ahead of yourself. You boys (and girls if any) out did yourselves this time, great job. PS....I love that dog in single and multi ....nice touch"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While it has one of the weaker campaign stories, it is none the less fun to play. Graphically pleasing and plays rather well. However that same sense of smoothe, quick paced gameplay does not seem to carry through to the all important multiplayer component. Riddled with lag, a sense that you are running through marshmallows persists no matter what detail level you set it on. While addictive it does come at the price of your patience. One can't but wonder what happended to the idea of dedicated servers? Here in South Africa that would help a long way with our less than adequite line quality. However with all its faults this remains a Call of Duty title, so those who will find dwindling games on the other titles this is the logical game to get."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,More realistic better graphics better weapons
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is super good i would recommend it to my friends and every one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Dont know why people are hating on Ghosts. Awesome game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't a reinvention of the franchise. Ghosts is a new CoD franchise. It is a copy paste of previous Call of Duty games and the franchise fatigue could be felt throughout the whole game. Whether you are a fan or not of the CoD franchise, you can always expect a working game, that can offer you the same kind of fun you had on earlier games. In my opinion, even if the game didn't innovate much, the campaign kept me interested with its varied missions till the end. It might not be the best CoD game but I wouldn't call it the worst.   PROS +Engaging campaign with fun but improbable story (variety in missions, space, underwater, etc; compared to Battlefield 4). +Serviceable game ('Works out of the box', unlike BF4 that's just way too buggy to play both Campaign and especially Online). +Riley, the German Sheperd dog, is actually fun to control once given the control. But, that rarely happen. +Decent voice acting (Stephen Lang!).  CONS: -Dated engine (Might be heavily modified and a proven engine, but that Quake 3 engine is way too old in today's gaming) -Weapons sounds are bad. -No volume options (Can't tone down the music and tone up the voice sound, i.e.). -'Railroad missions', Extremely linear, no place for exploration, Obey game scripts or die and repeat until you do. -Bland multiplayer. Doesn't innovate much on that aspect. Same Call of Duty vibe from past CoD games. -No notable innovation in this game. I felt the CoD fatigue while playing Ghosts but you do know what you're expecting though. -Running speed is so damn slow, same with reload; unlike BF4 that do have these fast enough.  OVERALL: I actually liked the campaign mode, albeit being extremely linear and like the Modern Warfare series, very improbable. The story mode is long enough for a war game and also, the missions are quite different from each others. Compared to Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts is way better, varied and actually engaging. But the multiplayer has little to offer on Ghosts.  RECOMMEND: As a new franchise, I'd recommend for the campaign mode, if you do seek a fun war game, with interesting 'improbable' story. But I wouldn't recommend this game for the multiplayer if you already have a previous Call of Duty game since this one have little new to offer you. Better yet, stick with Battlefield 3 for multiplayer gameplay... and BF4 once it gets fixed down the road.  Best recommendation: Get this game on a deal. 60$ for the campaign is expensive and I should have waited for Steam holiday sales to get this game.  RATING: 7.0 / 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign is great, Extinction is a great alien co-op mode...better than zombies. Squads and Multiplayer are not that good.... Suggest waiting for this game to go on sale and buy it for Campaign and Extinction mode."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,beas
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have liked all of the COD games, Ghosts is a little too short over all and the missions themselfs could have given more time to explore and kill more enemys. I loved the space missions but again they where way to short. Overall I still recommend this game highly to all COD Fans."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a vanilla FPS game what more is there to say
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is ok and i would recommend it but i would only get it when it goes on sale
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"GET IT, or ELSE!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this. Just don't.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very fine game recommend 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you don't have any optimization issues (like me), and now that they have added the FOV slider, then you'll find that this is a meh COD game with a crappy PC port. This is not worth the price tag even with the 'Gold Edition' price, and Black Ops II is the better PC COD, but this is still fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like everything about this game its just awesome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice 1person shooting game, good multiplayer with a lot off russian hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the mapdesign is really bad, just 3 maps are good, i dont care about graphics, some textures are terrible but overall it looks ok, its a classic COD game just the mapdesign was better in the previos games"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is broken on so many levels.....campaign...generic as hell. Storyline...? If you say so. Multiplayer.....sigh.....they want to get players 'in the action faster,' so what is their answer to this? Make bigger maps and then just spawn the player right behind the person that just shot them..... You spend so much time being dead it's almost unplayable. If they fix the spawns it might be worthwhile but even then I'm not sure. Everything unlocks with squad points now so there isn't a rank system that you are shooting for to get that next gun since you can save up and buy it in a few rounds of play. Extinction is fun the first few times and if they added some variation to the levels like Left for Dead then it would probably be a better experience. Squads....useless. Again, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over the hardcore multiplayer with a laughably small amount of play modes but the one and only bright side is, in the regular modes, it no longer takes you an entire clip to kill someone as with previous Call of Duties. If you can get this game for well under $30, then sure go for it. $60....don't waste the money. Mabye Infinity Ward will get a clue next time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THe game is fine if u don't like it don't play it! And it would be nice to respect the developers becouse they worked realy hard on the game and i would want to see u make a bether game!  So deal with it scrub...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but a cpu hog so hope you have a good pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice game, better history than other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t games before like MW3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just finished the single player game. In the PC version, make sure you have a kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ video graphic card. Have a good amount of RAM. After install, run a defrag to get your game files in place. The story line was interesting. If you paid the money, don't complain, just play the game......."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This review is of Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts Single Player...  I never play a single player, but if thats your sort of thing, you may or may not like this one!!  For any more info, please google 'call of duty ghosts single player review'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,with a 64bit system this game rocks and with 8gb ram and a amd 3 cpu overclocked with water cooler things stay cool and Ghosts bring it all home !. I was not disaponited and this game delivers the goods ! its all team work for sure ! with good old Dog by my side !lol !!see you out there and have fun !.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice 1person shooting game, good multiplayer with a lot off russian hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"no different than any other call of duty made. but, like every other call of duty, still has fun gameplay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,  Amazing and Intresting Storyline! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OK!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Next-Gen Headshot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The first call of duty game i ever play, one of the best games i played so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yeah its fun. Better than Black Ops. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far, it's good! but i prefer Multiplayer (since this is first CoD game that i bought it.not cracked :v ) But, in single, i prefer on the previous one. Not that bad but not that good. And careful, they migh crash sometimes. Not friendly to mid-spec. Actually, i got depressed...Why i bought this game? xD so..... this game is actually worth to try, atleast just wait for another discount xD or......dont buy this game. Not good for health"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome Game! Definitely Worth IT!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best COD yet, good balance between all weapons :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesomm gameplay , recommended to all MW3 players :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool!~~~
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think COD Ghosts is everything Blops2 was suppose to be. This is by far the best (balanced) COD released other than fixing some of the spawning issues here and there it's a great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont like that this game takes a lot of space!  I like this game cause it has hecka good guns!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think is the best cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game. Not so many cheaters anymore. I would recommend it !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, only downside is just the lag on multiplayer, but mangable, totally worth it in the end."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Could of been a lot better. Not may people play becasue of preformance issues at launch and Feild of View setting locked. Black Ops II smokes Ghost. You paid for map packs and are unable play becasue the game is dead most of the time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Loved everything about the game. The story, the weapons...Riley (heheh). Graphics were low quality and the game lagged a little; but I'm using an older computer, so I won't complain. On a scale of 1 to 10 overall, I give it a 9!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Game! Though they need to fix the llag in this game, not server lag, but performance. I have a GT 740m which is a great and cheap graphics card, but I can only run at Normal Image quality and High Textures. Then you're thinking, High? Damn that's good! But I literally turned everything off like Depth of Field, FXAA, And all that.... I would very reccomend this game for anyone who wants a great multiplayer experience and cool gamemodes like Extinction."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,all of the people that say the game is buggy and laggy must just hav bad computers because i hav no problems runing with a quad core 2.7GHZ processor 8GB of ram and AMD radeon HD 7870 graphics card
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its not a bad but upgrade you pc it's a next gen game the only thing i hate is that they never fix the part with the hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not the best but nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome Game, Great Ending. Don't listen to haters on this game, probably some battlefield fanboys, a great FPS game that is on steam, try it out, it does'nt hurt."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,story is good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game! must buy if you are a FPS gamer!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD: Ghosts is an AWESOME game for playing with friends!You can fight against Aliens in Extinction or play against each other in Multiplayer!Overall I give COD: Ghosts 9/10!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think this game is pretty good overall but you have to have a good pc like mine :-) alienware.no lag and great graphics.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Loving it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I must have an amazing computer.. oh wait I do. 7.9 microsoft score. The game works fine for me. Its alot of fun to play.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i think its a good game and its fun, i agree i think you need a super computer to play it but the rest of the games from now on is gonna need those requirements because games are just gonna get better, and why waste your time writing a bad review?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best stories so far in the call of duty franchise in my opinion. worth the money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far, pretty badass. Bluescreened my system at first startup, but after a re-boot, no problems"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a great game but very easy to beat the missions 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Would I reccomend this game to others? Do you enjoy Call of Duty games? Then yes I would reccomend it. Do you enjoy military FPS with an action bent to them? Then I would reccomend it. Are you looking for a reimagining of the Call of Duty franchise? Are you wanting a military simulator? A deep moving story? Then I would not reccomend because what you're looking for is no Call of Duty. The game is big, dumb, fun, just like every CoD before it. No better. No worse. For some the bloom is off the rose, but for my money I enjoy these every year. This is the first one I picked up on PC and haven't had the frame rate problems that a lot of folks seem to have. The main campaign is a fairly straightforward story. Some fun set-pieces with flooding cities, collapsing buildlings and more explosions that you can shake a stick at. Kick it up to Vetran and it at least offers a little bit of resistance to running through it.  Multiplayer isn't too bad except that I haven't been able to get many games in. Pretty unpopulated on the PC. But there are bot matches, which is my prefernce anyway. The Sqauds system is fun, giving you multiple characters to level and build out your AI team the way you want. Nothing much new from MW3 or BlopsII, although there seems to be less emphasis on crazy kill streak rewards. The new Cranked mode is a fun twist as well with a kill giving you a 30 second time to get another kill (as well as a speed boost). If you hate campers that should be your jam. If you like camping you might want to find another mode. The maps are varied, although some seem a bit big for the number of players.  I didn't get a chance to play Extinction yet, but it seems to be a mash-up of the suvival mode from MW3 and the Zombies mode from Treyarchs games. Not a bad combo.  Overall, it's Call of Duty. If you already hate the series, it's not going to change that. If you like the series it also probably won't change that. It can look quite good at times (I got a pretty steady 40ish FPS on mid-level settings with mid-level gaming laptop) and has some different level designs that offer a slight change of pace, but mostly it's the same shooting and moving they've been offering for 10+ games now. If you're not burned out on the concept of cinematic/action/military FPS, give it a try."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,AMAZING!!!!!!! A must if your a fps fan
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For some reason, I'm unable to review the MULTIPLAYER aspect of this game.  Two words; EXTINCTION MODE! ITS SO BADASS! YES! GOOD GOOD!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To Start off with, the game was awful for PC. It was cleary unoptimized for PC gamers and was designed for console gamers. But, after a series of updates and fixes, the game has been optimized, the RAM requirement has been lowered and it runs smoothly on any decent PC. The campaign is fun, although a little linear, multiplayer is has improved darastically after the updates and is as fun as any previous COD multiplayer, and Extinction is insane! I reccomend this game for people new to COD and to people who have played before, however, i feel it's infinty ward's weakest game yet.  rating: 7.5-8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Glitched. So much glitches to an average game. I use an i5 processor with HD 7770 GPU and all other requirements on more than recommended. There are times it hangs in-game or even just on the main menu. It does not happen a lot. What happens a lot is the texture glitches that block out the entire screen in-game which disappears if I switch weapons. It's so frustrating especially when I'm using my favorite weapons and it wont' go out unless I restart the game. It also happens on multiplayer, which using your favorite weapon is very important and almost half of my deaths occur because of it. Couple that with common multiplayer CoD glitches like you die even if you shot first, some shooting accuracy issues, etc. It's so unfair. But otherwise, it's classic CoD fun when it works. meaning the biggest change is you have a dog. And I just lost more than $60 because I bought it retail on my own country. I do recommend this game if you can stomach all my gripes. It's still fun, but with much more frustration and some excitement lost. It's playable but I can't help but wish I could have my money back to buy Battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game Rocks ! The Campaign was a bit short but the graphics are awesome and you can spend hours looking at the detail terrain and objects. Well done to the development team !!   Where the true fun is though, is the multiplayer. Team Death Match (as always !) is highly recommended. Awesome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Partly funny game to play ;D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Enjoyable, action packed and even balanced game. No problems with it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool not mz fave call of duty but ok
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It gets boring when you have played it for a while. But i still really recommend it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a great game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I haven't played a competitive MP shooter since the original Half-Life Deathmatch, &amp; I'm really really really enjoying this one.  The SP is very short, starts strong &amp; finishes really weak, but the MP has been engaging as hell.  The only major gripe is the hackers &amp; cheaters, &amp; it's making me want to move to a console version for a better experience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great singleplayer,Moderate multiplayer,Fun with friends,Horrible alone,Extinction is amazingly fun but gets old fast if you play it with bad teammates,HUGE drawback is the horrific company support for the pc version,Until VERY recently some game breaking bugs were around and were not even recognized by the producer,it was fixed accidently in a random patch [same way it was broken],That reduces some score from the total in my opinion,So total score for the game would have to be 7/10.  -1 for the support for the game. -1 for the connectivity online [NO DEDICATED SERVERS,EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PROMISED BEFORE RELEASE.] -1 for the lack of story or background behind the Extinction mode.  Overall i still recommend this game ,But if you are still not sure,I suggest you wait for a sale before you buy it,It's fun with friends but the 60$ price point is a bit high in my opinion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome game, love the personalized weapons and the multiplayer is awesome"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not optimized for most gpu's
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game but sadly lost interest for it pretty quickly. It just couldnt hold my interest liek the previous one did.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool game and nice multiplayer maps
Call of Duty: Ghosts,- Good campaign - campaign had like 6 30 minute levels - campaign was over quickly - got on multiplayer - 12 yr old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my mom  8/8 m8
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts, I've played it for about 13hours (Multiplayer) and I've enjoyed it so far, real fun and face paces.  Ghosts bring me back to Black Ops I, how you have to buy the weapons by getting points, back at Black Ops I it was using Wager to get weapons so on, but now at Ghosts the give you squad point, getting points by ranking up or doing other thinks within' the match, headshots, completing a field order and etc....  There is some problem within' the game stutters, lag, freezes within' the beginning of the game  Love the guns, they put in alot of different type of gun in new on old ones, really fun to use, also added new perks so as attachment.  I've enjoyed Call of Duty: Ghosts so far, if your a real fan of the Call of Duty franchise I would recommend you to try Ghosts yourself.  But I still wish that the graphics could be better.  Overall rating from me would be about.... 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If I were to recomend this game I would say yes I love the campain and the multiplayer is amazing yea it might be not like Black ops II, But its an amazing game and it has good weapon balacnce. It has good maps like Black ops II except more range and like mw2 and mw3 it has a 25 special killstreak called the KEM STRIKE wich blows up and changes the map.    : )"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10   The fish swim away
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Banned For life for no reason 10/10 will never play again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a fun game. I prefer the physics like MW2. More realistic movemnt here. Still miss the arcade feeling of the old MW2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,eh its okay why all dis
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A game there is combinated with nearly all call of duty modern warfare games. like from here. :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so awesome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hardcore Search and Rescue is the No1 game to play, and the extinction series is cool too in co op mode."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I actually liked this game quite a bit, aside from the campers all over HC mode. The maps are beautiful (especially Stonehaven), and the first couple of DLCs I loved (Michael Myers and Predator), I'd hoped they'd continue with movie-themes, but alas. In any case, I can't play it much these days, as there's very very very few people online. If I want to play it, I have to just play against bots in Private Mode. It's almost as fun, but you don't have the human interaction of actually playing online. I wish more people liked it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes, the single player and multiplayer are pretty much predictable. What makes this game so great are the private match and the squads mode. Going online as a noob on this is totally demoralising. Play private match and get use to the maps,modes and options and you can then play online and hold your own. The AI in private and squad mode is probably the best i've ever seen. Squad mode just keeps you coming back for more, it's totally addictive."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,could be better in single player mode
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice 2 play after hard work!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really worth it. It has great gameplay and weaponry. I enjoy playing with friends and multiplayer. I do recomend this game but the one thing I dont like is how long it takes to rank up.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WAT DO YOU THINK I THINK.....?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game full of cheaters,who are allowed to play.Really,do something about this thing cause people bought this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to enjoy game not to be scammed and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed by minority of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.Players getting tired of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t wont buy it again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I absolutely love this game, It runs really smooth and the only lag I have is on some multiplayer sessions. I think you guys really need to jump on the hackers and take care of them but other than that, I would buy it again.   3.2GHZ,16GB Ram, 1TB SSD, 4GB Video Card."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really haven't cared for the Call of Duty franchise since COD: WOW, but I'm really lovin this one. I feel this game has really stepped away from the FFA paintball feel that became very prominent in BO2. I Really like this game:)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good Game, Migh lower the graphics so many other people can play the game.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think its a good game and value for money because there are many modes of play to choose from especially squads. I recommend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's cool but there is a lot of fps drop an lack of dedicated servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Give me the free DLC please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game rocks !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i love all the series of this game,and the latest(Ghost) has a lot of improvements,but something must be doing with the cheaters in multiplayer game,they destroy all the good things."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I stayed away from this game after MW4 as that was the best game to date and the following game (cant remember what it was now) was so poor i didnt buy another COD till Ghosts and only becuase they promised dedicated servers. Well i feel like ive been done over again by these people as there are no dedicated servers and no dedicated rentable servers, just a match making lobby. It dont matter what they promise now as i wont buy another game with their name on it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In my opinion its a very good game, its just the lack of people that makes the game worse for me, if it would be repopulated, do buy it. If you dont want to buy it at full price, wait for sales. I like the game alot so far"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Typical COD far too short single player story, usual action fun, way too much DLC etc. I got this gor 9$ on Amazon, that is about what 5hrs of single player is worth, Also needs 45gb of space. DLC, as usual is pricey. 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Story Mode bad Multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,CoD Ghosts is on of the best CoDs in my opinion 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, love all the maps and weapons and the endless character custonisation options! 10/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best game i have play ever :):):) 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How to play 'Call of Duty: Ghost' Step one: download the game Step two: install the game Step three: play the game Step four: Un-install the game Step five: never play again  1337/420 would eat doritos and drink mountain dew again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Having a great PC allows me to enjoy the graphically intense side of ghosts. However people who cannot afford PC's like mine may be slightly disapointed when they play the game. This has caused many people to leave ghosts behind, resulting in local players having to find international servers, which can be even more laggy. I really love this game but I wish there were some way to get the community back up where I live. I cannot reccomend this to anyone who has a bad PC. However the people with good ones should definitly take this game into consideration as it is highly intense and fun to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes infact i do reccomend it.it would be 8/10 for campaign and 7.5/10 for multiplayer. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,VAC banned me for no reason and i really want my game back.. You should at least be happy that someone realy likes your gam.. so please unbanned me.. please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,guns and stuff not quite cod2 though. i want WW2!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought this game for 20 â‚¬ and i got a mouse pad with Call of Duty Black Ops 2 on it so i guess all of you who bought the game from steam are stupid &gt;P
Call of Duty: Ghosts,An underrated Call of Duty. The single player campaign is every bit as intense as other Call of Dutys and has elements from the classic World War 2 titles like Tank battles and modern titles like Helicopter battles and even Under Water and Space battles. It's a fun campaign.  Are there technical issues? Yes but the game is still playable and fun. I recommend it for fans of the series but wait for a sale. Activision charges too much for older Call of Dutys.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game gets so much hate but the campaign mode was actually quite fun, short, but fun. I would definitely say buy this for no more than 20 bucks you will get some satisfaction out of it for sure. I agree that the MP sucks, in fact I would rather walk barefoot on LEGO for 50 hours than play one hour of the MP."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great story line, good amount of challenge. Ending was a bit weird though. Also, in the Sin city chair scene, unless you switch your use button from F to Left mouse click, you can't move on. (or you can have a fast enough keyboard input method to get past this scene)  Great Story line + 10 Weird ending -0.2 Poorly Designed scene (just one) - 1  8.8/10 is the score I would give to this great game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought it via amazon for Â£6, certainly don't regret paying that much for it. Still has some very obvious bugs that won't get fixed now i would think considering the age of the game. That being said i enjoyed playing through the single player campaign. I would'nt pay full price for this game though, its not worth that even though activision still try to charge that on Steam outside of sales. If you buy from another source cheap enough and can live with the bugs it has its ok to pass some time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I recommend this game. It still needs a bit of work. Single player is pretty intense. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is broken. sucked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great story, fantastic gameplay, brilliant mechanics, and all the issues the game has currently are most likely going to be fixed soon. Over all, a good buy, many people will tell you other wise either for the reason 'It's Call of Duty' and some of them actually complain that it feels different. The Extinction mode certainly has potential, the campaign was well done, had a good story, and was a good length. Squads mode is really fun, especially with friends. The multiplayer is well done, the spawns are already confirmed for getting a patch, and the mechanics in the multiplayer as well as the maps are wonderful. Overall a 8.6/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Game has Had its problems During Launch just like many othe Big Titles, how ever Infinity Ward have Done A Really Good Job To patch This, post in Campaign and multiplayer, i havent played much of the campaign but of what i did play, was very good, now we can all Debate on if this is realy a next gen game or is it any different from CoD's previus game how ever it doesent matter the game is getting stale, but not only that the mechanic/netcode is broken like crazy in this version and isnt helping with sales with the game, it is also taking the skill and fun out of the game, ovbiously on the campaign it doesent really play a big factor but its noticeable, on multiplayer is where it is really noticeable and even the most hardcore CoD Fans Are Saying previus games Were Better Than this one and i would Agree with them, this game needs a Solid Patch To Fix Everything, and then just maybe this game can be called a Classic CoD Game cas it isn't one at the moment, it is playable unlike it's largest Competitor Being BF4 as of 13/12/2013 how ever both game have their Problems. I would reccomend this game if its ever on this years holiday sale but as of yet, their are still too many issues with the game to be paying full price for it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Outstanding game, I love it...BUT...it's extremely difficult to get into any game under 'hardcore'....Im not sure if it has something to do with filters or what. I have waited almost an hour just to get into a room. I'm still figuring out alot of stuff...I would love to get into one of the new style games under 'standard' like 'hunt' or 'hunted' or whatever its called...I just cant figure out how. The graphics are excellent, sound is unmatched in any game I have ever played. The single player was a little.........short, for lack of a better word. I love the idea of buying weapons and equipment before you unlock it. Which ever one of you guys came up with that....well done, it allows you to get bits and pieces to help your style without letting you get ahead of yourself. You boys (and girls if any) out did yourselves this time, great job. PS....I love that dog in single and multi ....nice touch"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,More realistic better graphics better weapons
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love Stabby
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome game but hard to get clan members
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love it despite its repetition from the other CoD games. Still an enjoyable game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The story was pretty good but the gameplay was obviously the same as the past COD games. The multiplayer was also sucky because it doesn't look as clean as the previous ones
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Enjoyable... if you have a PC from NASA :P Other than that its the same running 'n gunning game except this one has bird AI
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very much the game to get!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i recemend this game cause yolo
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is a game that is nice to me, personally. I was patient enough to wait for the patches and fixes to the various bugs, crashes and 'surprises' that I ran into and now have a better experience playing. I would recommend it !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would reccomend this game becuase the game runs smoothly and the new engine that developers set out turns out to be magnificent. I know some other users will experience that this game is not worth your time because it lags and stuff well maybe it is probably because you guys run a crappy computers or something that does not run the game very properly from your perspective. From my perspective I think the game is worth my time installing it and enjoying the campaign and multiplayer mode. I still think that this game is the best one that Infinity Ward has ever released. Period.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"10/10 Gave it to a friend, he punched me down."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is full of excitement and entertaining, as a shooter gamer I would recommend the game to everyone. But as from my experience and from what I read all over every gaming websites, the multiplayer gaming is full of hackers and cheaters, I would see one player gets a score of 20 to 30 kills when everyone only gets a max of 12 kills only. I just hope activision would correctly do something about this. I am a victim of getting a VAC and have been banned for no reason, I am one of those honest gamer that discourages hacking or cheating because firstly it's not fair for all of the gamers and second, developers deserves a lot more than this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought Ghosts on Steam sale for $20...... Well worth the money -- $10 would have been better but twenty is reasonable.  What's not to like in PC campaign mode? answer -- nothing. tight combat (as expected), exciting cinematic, large, over the top survival action scenes, sharks, and more very tight combat. Just played BO 2 and BF 3. Ghosts , in my opinion, is the superior experience.... I only play campaign mode. The story has some good elements -- betrayal, revenge, brotherhood all with a geo political backdrop -- believable enough.  My first FPS ever played was half life. I've played all cod titles - campaign mode and most major FPS releases ---- campaign mode. Ghosts ranks in top 3-4 for cod. Not sure why some folks dump on it. Taken as an FPS alone, it's a great game.   Really can't comment on the MP aspect -- don't play it.... used to but no more time,,,,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS SOO SUPER !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best games ever for fast pace first shooting.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Mixed reviews sure , but still fun all in all. Better than CS go if you want fast gameplay"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A lot of people hated this game. I have to say, when it comes to Call of Duty, you have to keep an open mind. I think Ghosts is a GREAT addition to the Call of Duty lineup. I play it on Xbox 360 mainly but got PC to join other friends. Weapons are awesome, maps are various (some for snipers, some for CQB)   If you can, get this game and the season pass. I am starting my collection of COD on PC, I have the entire series for Xbox, 360 &amp; One."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best stories so far in the call of duty franchise in my opinion. worth the money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WOW. lost of wineing but no cheese. LOL no issue if you got a game rige. Quit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ man up and play!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game to play. I liked Black Ops II better but Ghost is not a horrible game. Not the best but still worth playing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,soo much hate on this game but not that bad action packed not for those who are looking for a simple shooter pick up and play its fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not a fan of the Call of Duty franchise, but the amazing story and exeptional playability of this game makes it a game that I can play for hours on end."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are looking for an Academy Award winning screenplay, you will not find it here. If you are looking for a Michael Bay story but better, then this is what you need to play. This story managed to keep me engaged throughout the entire game and kept me wanting more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dear cod team hello my name is saman sharifi  (samansharifiasadi@gmail.com).  thank you very much. your shot gun is not real moreover you can work on explosive and ruin too. your geraphic is the best however some sound and video updates are necessary. your zombi map is single and not realised with single player mode another map nevertheless it need some check points. Not only your multiplayer is more important than single player mode  but also a lot of maps are needed (50% of yor maps good as cod black ops 2). good bye.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was a huge fan of mw3.. Even though there was the casual bad spawn points and op'ed weps..  But this game.. Do not buy it..  I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.. You start at rank 1 and have to fight ur way up in ordrer to unlock perks weps and a lot of other things.. But compared to mw3. This game is taking ages.. Ur a damn meat shield until you get certain perks which is not unlocked before rank 30..  This game is totally not worth it, and I greatly regret buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far this is the best call of duty I have played and I'm really glad that it was made by infinity ward as modern warfare and modern warfare 2 were really good. I love the new effects, and movement in game like peeping round cover. I also love the campaign and how good it is as I didn't think black ops 2 was that good. I would give this game a 5* and would recommend it to everyone. Ignore what everyone is saying, I havent had any problems running it on my laptop and I can even run it on high. I have not experienced any bugs or framerate drops and would like to say that this game does look nice it just helps if your not running it on the lowest settings, but even then its still just as fun, so go buy it its an amazing game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I enjoyed it. I wish people could give actual reasons for not liking this game though, not just opinionated hate mush."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghost is one of my new favorites.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 The last CoD that didn't included Exo Suits.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome, defenetly worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is pretty good I would say 6.5/10. But don't buy this game for multiplayer it lacks a player base.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Please join COD Ghost the game is definitely playable but needs a larger PC presence.  The performance is much better since the game launch.  I run this off a laptop from 2012 proves they did optimize it after all.   -Tip try getting it on sale though they are still trying to milk this for around full price. :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not bad game cod:ghost
Call of Duty: Ghosts,is really awesome :3  buy it if u like COD series
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it has a doge
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It may be a bit of more of the same games as before, but I like the kind of multiplayer found in CoD series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS: + Gameplay + Graphics + Ability to practice with bots  CONS: - Poor performance - Bugs and crashes - Lack of innovation - Short, 'on-rails', clichÃ©-ridden campaign - Multiplayer matchmaking system, lack of dedicated servers - Small, poorly designed maps - Unbalanced - Paid map packs Review : 2/10"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of my favourite CODS. Story was a bit short but otherwise great. Online is just as good as ever if not better. Easlity better than black ops 2. Developers support the PC platform with quality patchs that come out super fast.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"People who complain about the stuttering and saying that it makes the game unplayable are wrong! Yes, the game shouldn't stutter and should be fixed ASAP but this is still a lot of fun. To fix most of the stutter, disable the steam overlay and go offline on your friends. I know this is stupid but it's a temporary work around (I HOPE)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Review for single player. Pretty boring with some new twist's. Honestly the german shephard is only thing that makes this campaing it. I did like space fighting and what not. But, like Bo2 it's not a movie. It's straight up rushed 'Save the world' type deal.   Sadly awesome story setting was ruined with poor story telling and showing mysterious ghost characters in an instant."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game runs realy well very entertaining dont now why people are moning. i didnt have day 1 release had it for christmas with a couple of extra patches. overall i would recomend runs very well &amp; entertaining. i5 3330 3.2 ghz 8 gb ddr3 and nvidia gtx 650 ti boost 2gb and a wd black drive.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best COD games i had ever played so far :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i instal call of duty ghost and i cant play game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game..not great but worth the price if you get it on sale
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After finishing this on the Xbox 360 a few years back what l remembered about this Call of Duty was the great story and the fun game play. From the sharks and underwater battles to the my favorite the tank and space battles, this game l remembered was awesome. Now l have a pretty powerful PC l thought l would give it another go after finishing Advance Warfare with Kevin Spacey on the Xbox One and man this is hands down so much better. l actually enjoyed every more on this game than Advance Warfare. I don't play multiplayer so l can't judge on that but for the story it is a cool game. l like the idea of the federation as an enemy as l am tired of Russian, Nth Korean and Chinese as the bad guys. If you have skipped this or like a fun corridor shooter that plays tight and well l highly recommend it. Just don't get to upset at the bad ending. It all went well then.....well l won't spoil it but it is very lame. Overall highly recommended and the best Call of Duty until Black Ops 3 comes out...but that looks the same as advance warfare at the moment......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Of The Past COD'S! I've been playing COD since #2 and must say this one offers the most versitle range of missions ever. Besides this it puts the player into the game with realistic actions active av. The missions are intense most realistic war sim i've ever played. A must have if you are a mission based COD Junky like me. I haven't played much multiplayer so I can not comment on it. Don't know why this game got such a bad name. I can still recall being introduced to Ghost back in Modern Warfare 2. Few missions tipped the player off as what was brewing in the future. I love Ghosts best in series. Also played COD Black Ops 1-2 but still return to the COD Advanced Warfare Series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not happy at the moment!  I bought personalized characters/items for $25.07 and was charged $32.66, I then bought the COD BlackOps 111 + Deluxe Pre-Purchase for $99.99 and was charged $129.29 plus I see I have been charged International Transactions Fees as well ($0.98 &amp; $3.88).  WHY???"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of duty ghosts Sucks ... very bad game.... every time this is a laaag  dont buy it at all until activion fix this match making and alot of bugs .....   GHOSTS SUCKS if u really wanna buy Cod go for COD 4 instead of this...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game! buy it! you will not regret it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hard 'Ghost - Gameplay '. =)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is bad in to it can run amd cards
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are looking for an Academy Award winning screenplay, you will not find it here. If you are looking for a Michael Bay story but better, then this is what you need to play. This story managed to keep me engaged throughout the entire game and kept me wanting more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great story. Best story since MW2. However single player is rather short...roughly 6 hours. Multiplayer is tons of fun. Kind of confusing trying to get different setups. I'd prefer just being able to unlock everything by level instead of having to try and do special things with certain things equipped. Minor complaints, but very fun. Ran smoothly on my pc. 7870, 8g ram, 8350 AMD cpu."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Part from food, this is an every day thing that I do! The Multiplayer is what I do."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awsome Game... I love it! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"GOOD MAPS, TACTICAL PLAY."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,doesnt load so annoying
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All the comments are bad,don't know why.  1. Campaign was the best campaign I have played so far in cod. You get to fight in space, water, and other environments never presented in the history of call of duty.  2. Multiplayer is the best I have played so far. Love how you get to customize your own character and squad. The squads mode allows you to play against ai controlled soldiers and you are still able to rank up and customize your loadouts.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please note that playing COD Ghost in good conditions requires a rather powerful PC with a recent GPU and a least 8 Go of Ram. In addition, the PC version was ridden with technical problems which is totally unacceptable in general and even more so when it affects one of the most respected and lucrative franchise in the industry.  So why do I recommend this game?  Simply because when you put technical issues aside, COD Ghost is amazing.  -a very interesting setting : the game universe is a post-apocalyptic America at war with a powerful south american federation. the game environments are rendered in great details and have a desolate beauty to them that I find almost poetic   -a great diversity of design (SP) : all missions include a nice twist on the design formula. You infiltrate a compound, you navigate underwater, you take part in a full scale tank assault. It's still COD but it shows that the designers went to great lenghts to keep the game exciting   -a good story (SP) : the game focuses on a small group of elite units. It is a more personal theme and although there are plenty of action, it drops the bombastic tone of former entries for something more subtle and grounded. You feel part of a unit playing a small yet vital part on a bigger war front.   -Great multiplayer (MP): the conventional MP is great and packed with amazing maps which are a blast to play and still convey that post apo vibe. In addition, there is an extinction mode which is more or less COD meets Left4Dead. You are a team of soldiers fighting beast-like aliens and you have to use special abilities to stand a chance.  All of this makes Ghost my favorite entry in the COD franchise. It's just a pity that so many people seem to dislike the game. It makes me wonder if they even gave it a chance...  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This review focuses primarily on the singleplayer aspects of Ghosts; I realize many enjoy the multiplayer aspect, and it is indeed good but I'm much too old to be berated by 12 year olds so I tend to avoid the multiplayer, likewise it's something that seems to get largely overlooked in the reviews. ;-D  The campaign is the usual CoD fodder: a Michael Bay movie with more explosions but dialogue that usually doesn't make you cringe. Essentially it follows the tried and true angry arch nemesis from the past route that every CoD game since Modern Warfare has done. While it certainly isn't horrible, it isn't spectacular either; unfortunately the first mission fills you with hope that everything is going to be a bit different from previous campaigns, perhaps you will be fighting predominantly locally as a guerilla fighter and being challenged with weaponry that doesn't completely trump your opposition, particularly since they portray a fascinating scenario in which the front lines have stagnated much like world war 1 with a no-mans land between the sides... no such luck. You go from guarding the wall with your awesome dog and Superman (your brother) to becoming a scuba diving, globe trotting, ninja in the blink of an eye with a bunch of indistinguishable and forgettable spec ops.  Overall, every level is decent in and of itself and the setpieces are spectacular, albeit sometimes the plans are more absurd than an A-Team episode (i.e. instead of destroying the pylons of an oil rig while you are already scuba diving below it, sabotaging said oil rig to explode while you're on it). Unfortunately just as soon as you begin to understand a mechanic it's gone forever. Riley your lovable and homicidal dog is only in the first few missions so just as soon as you get the gist of using him to attack he's no longer available. Similarly gadgets like thermal vision, tear gas, or strobe lights that blind and disorient the enemy are only utilized for a minute at most in the campaign leaving you thinking 'that was fun, can't wait to try that again' only to eventually realize you won't ever get to try that mechanic again unless you reload that level.  In summary, the single player of Ghosts is overall enjoyable but it would have been a considerably stronger gameplay experience if they had focused more on a few mechanics such as fighting alongside Riley and done less globe trotting, basing the majority of the story in Southern California instead. Buy it on sale when it's about the price of going to a movie and you'll likely enjoy the singleplayer. Of course after the campaign you can always jump into the multiplayer and be berated by 12 year olds extending the value of the title considerably if that's your thing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes, this is another generic, overpriced COD. I wait for 2 years to get a -67% off. Although there are not much improvements for so many years since COD4. Same engine, slightly better graphics. I would say it's still a great shooter. Nobody is playing online, so I cannot give any comment on the MP mode. The plot of the singleplayer campaign is alright. It's enjoyable for FPS fans. Just don't expect some groundbreaking revolutions from the game (especially for those who has played lots of CODs in the past)  *I noticed that people get the graphics lagging/tearing problem. I fixed it by setting the Anti-Aliasing to off. Hope that helps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very Fun and exciting game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best game of all time, hands down. Addictive, fast paced, fun and social. Does it get any better - no it doesn't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hey guys this my first call of duty, and i love it but can you tell me how i can activate the multiplayer charakter code  thanks foreward  KEEP_SMIlING"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If loved MW3 then u're gonna LOVE ghost
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game... highly recommended. For those crying here buy a proper graphic card and stop crying ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,one of the best games that made my holyday better.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the mapdesign is really bad, just 3 maps are good, i dont care about graphics, some textures are terrible but overall it looks ok, its a classic COD game just the mapdesign was better in the previos games"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is broken on so many levels.....campaign...generic as hell. Storyline...? If you say so. Multiplayer.....sigh.....they want to get players 'in the action faster,' so what is their answer to this? Make bigger maps and then just spawn the player right behind the person that just shot them..... You spend so much time being dead it's almost unplayable. If they fix the spawns it might be worthwhile but even then I'm not sure. Everything unlocks with squad points now so there isn't a rank system that you are shooting for to get that next gun since you can save up and buy it in a few rounds of play. Extinction is fun the first few times and if they added some variation to the levels like Left for Dead then it would probably be a better experience. Squads....useless. Again, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over the hardcore multiplayer with a laughably small amount of play modes but the one and only bright side is, in the regular modes, it no longer takes you an entire clip to kill someone as with previous Call of Duties. If you can get this game for well under $30, then sure go for it. $60....don't waste the money. Mabye Infinity Ward will get a clue next time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just finished the single player game. In the PC version, make sure you have a kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ video graphic card. Have a good amount of RAM. After install, run a defrag to get your game files in place. The story line was interesting. If you paid the money, don't complain, just play the game......."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This review is of Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts Single Player...  I never play a single player, but if thats your sort of thing, you may or may not like this one!!  For any more info, please google 'call of duty ghosts single player review'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Extinction is addictive
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty: Ghosts Coool bat is not brblam en nvedia
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game the story line is great the MP is ok
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best cod ever!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player campaign is a wild ride despite its underwhelming storyline and short play through while the multiplayer aspects of the game take the cake and raise the franchise to even higher heights. It's jam packed with all sorts of new content from an engaging squads mode, a hectic Extinction mode and a new slate of multiplayer features to keep the core Call of Duty gamers playing for hours on end"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game more than the other CoD games, becouse it has much more meaning to the SNEAKY mechanic. Makes me feel much more clever. Also my favourite weapon of all time: the VKS. Recommend you not give up on this game. Its still great, but the community is dieing. Save this please!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i need a team guys a good mic ecuippet team cas its worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Brilliant game and well balanced. No one gun is over powered. Choose one that suits your playstyle. Excellent work!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alot of people like to dis the game but it is actually a really fun an addicting game if you take out the hackers and patch a few bugs but really how many games are perfect these days?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome storyline and gameplay!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yeah, CoD gets a lot of crap for annual releases and rehashing the same engine and mechanics, and maybe that is deserved. Still, I got my money's work out of it and had a good time finishing the campaign. It had some really cool, high budget set pieces and played like a big action movie. I had some shadow problems that were fixed by an Nvidia driver update, which then caused audio stuttering during cutscenes. It wasn't a huge deal to me, but it was irritating and took away from the otherwise high level of polish. The final scense were pretty cool. For multiplayer, I'm kind of over it, so haven't tried it yet."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There are a lot of people who dislike this game, but I think that most of them are overlooking some of the key aspects of Ghosts. Many people complain about FPS drops, which aren't an issue if you limit your ping when searching for games. If you have a decent computer, the game runs very smoothly. Although I am not much of a single player fan, I did finish the campaign. I thought it was more engaging than BF4, which I also own. The graphics, specifically lighting effects, are not even close to that of the past two Battlefields, but it is still very 'next-gen'. I have played one game of Extinction, and although it isn't my favorite game mode, I am very pleased with how it turned out. I do agree with others in the fact that without dedicated servers things get a little weird when trying to find a match. The two things that are probably the worst for me are actually finding games other than TDM and hit detection. My hit detection seems fine, a little iffy at times, but it seems to work okay. My issue is with my opponents hit detection. This has to do with internet connection and I don't think you can really get rid of this issue completely in modern day shooters (e.g. all of CoD and BF). An example of this is when I am getting hit by an enemy, so I hide behind the wall. Yet, I still manage to get killed. When watching the killcam, I see that in my opponents view, I am not yet even behind the wall. Other than these two issues, I find the game very fun. I would definitely recommend it. I don't think the others who rated this product are looking at the pros of it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"At first, I was very upset with this game, trying to run it on max settings, worked, but was a little laggy. So after moving the settings down a bit, I started to enjoy the game. The multi-player was kind of disapointing, After playing Battelfield 4 and then playing this, it was very sad... After playing some of the Single player story, I started to really like the game, so far, so good. After playing for a bit I started up and Extinction game, the new 'zombie' style game, I played solo, and was very happy about it, was not bad at all. The customization for the characters is nice, but most all of it has to be unlocked, so dont expect to have your character looking how u want right from the start. I WOULD recomend this game to all of those FPS fans out there, UNLESS you dont own Battlefield 4, I would buy that over this, if you can only get one of the games. Other than that, COD Ghosts is worth owning. My rating so far, 7.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All the developers and publishers of COD must be laughing their asses off in the most expensive stripclub, every year their fanbase keeps buying their lazy mods (I mean the whole game, every game since MW1) for topdollar and again with a seasonpass. This goose lays platinum eggs covered in blow. But this just means I have no high regard for the average fanbase. The reason I buy it are these: It's not on origin, 9 out of 10 friends own the game and I can't stand feeling left out when they are killing eachother off and as third, it's the best g*ddamn railshooter in the world. This time I said, I'm not gonna be wowwed, it's just a crappy ga...wooow here we go...I played it 5 hours straight to the finish and thought the end part was the best shooting experience I had in a long time. They still know how to blow up stuff after all these years, but that is it. Nothing new under the sun except the nice doggy. This would be great if this was a budget title and the NPC's wouldn't boss you around every second."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Out of all the other Call of Duty games I've played, this by far is among my top personal favorite along with Black Ops! The campaign is amazing and very well developed. Not in a long time, since Call of Duty Black Ops, have I received such an epic feel when playing through the missions and experiencing the epic cut-scenes. It feels great to start a Call of Duty campaign with a different and fresh plot, along with new characters, much like the story from Call of Duty 4 Modern Wafare. The Multiplayer is excellent! The character customization is the best part for people like me, and the squad concept makes it better! The maps are good and the weapons and perk system is great and well balanced.  The game deserves great attention, and fans like me, honestly appreciate this game and the developers for their hard work. Again, this game is amazing and the campaign of the game is my favorite aspect. I am very much excited and looking foward to the sequel!  'Legends Never Die. The Ghosts are real.' 9.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dhis game is not that awesome.The graphyc is not so bad but it could be better 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love the Multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get it off a key site for $7, it's worth it just for the campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game has up's and downs, 1 its short but still fun, multiplayer it feels similar Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and 2, i recoomend only if on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I hate call of duty so who am I to judge. Wait a minute if I hate COD then why do I play it. 9/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,LOVE IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's really nice game, nice graphics, gameplay, plot and gaming. It was pleasure to play it. :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A little bit Hoo-Rah! But all in all pretty cool, space missions, stealth missions, all pretty sweet in my opinion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i only paid 3 bucks for this game on ebay so its litt
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game .i like it . the online is the best
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The best CoD game out there, as far as story. Dont belive the haters. This is the superior Call of Duty! Highly recommend!! 9/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"one of the best games on steam, but like every cod game on here, its also dead, with only a couple of tdm lobbys.  got good controller support, feels smooth, i havnt got anything bad to say about it apart from the hackers that cod always gets. but in my opinion people are strange as this game works great and yet people would sooner moan about it then go play a rubbish over rated, clunky game like csgo, which i found to be as over rated as minecraft"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fantastic game when it runs. I have two other friends that have the same problem on pc's. The game starts and it'll go for 5 minutes or 30 minutes then it shuts down. I get a ' Disc read errow 'imagefile-40' and can't find any fix online that works, if your're playing it on a game console my son says that it works great, if you're a PC'er like us don't waste your oney.  Updte: I removed my steam account and all of the games I was hoarding. I then installed Steam and loaded only Ghost and the multiplayer version. Now it sems to run fine. Why hasn't anybody else posted this simple fix 'You don't have enough mermory to run it dummy' Would have saved me a lot of grief. Hope this helps someone else with the Error when running Ghost."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you loved CoD:MW2 and 3, you will definitely love this. Squads and Safeguard is my favorite thing to play here. Multiplayer isn't bad since it was made to be fast pace."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, can be a little repatitive, also; need to work on the trejectory of the VSR, not quite on the crosshair, otherwise, great game with a great campaign! 9/10 Revogaming.co.uk"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the more complete Call of Duty experiences. Yes, ultimately it's more of the same but that's what makes it a CoD game. Enjoyable single player experience, great co-op modes and some fantastic maps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game nice changes, black ops 2 sucked terribly, caused me to stop playing at all until this one came out much better then before and a real attempt went into this one to make it worth while unlike the last."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's pretty meh. Not horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't buy it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is still great, although the story does try to force aspects from the first game, such as forcing you to like your bother and father, it still has all the fun moments you'd expect from the trend setter for all modern shooters. Multiplayer is still fun, if you enjoyed previous IW games then Ghosts should not dissappoint although it's not the best CoD port. Extinction is like Left 4 Dead but I wouldn't rush to get this game simply for this new mode. However it is by no means not fun. Basically if you still enjoy Call of Duty games then this is a game worthy of your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is fun and will be worth the $$$ once they patch it as it can go from fun to really buggy. Campaigne is solid, online can get better. They need to allow server selection rather then randomized game search as it places you in rooms with people many levels ahead.  Recommend to wait for a sale, which rarely happens with CoD, or once they update and patch the PC port."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not what I expected
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"plays better than multiplayer. multiplayer a reasl let down, lags crashes"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is okay, abit short"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great storieline for a COD game. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Campiagn. Not the Best Multiplayer COD out there due to various plaguing issues found within. Steep system requirements only are justified for the Campaign not MP portion. Infinity Ward did a good job blending a variety of missions inside the Campaign that you never get bored. Visuals will vary depending on your system setup. Infinity Ward still has a lot of engine optimizations to pull off in order for the system requirements to justify the need for being so steep.   Overall, Great Campaign. MP not so great. Size of Maps are questionable in MP. Feels rushed to meet a street date. Performance problems are present. Visuals really shine in the Campaign while MP not so much.  Note: MP was played on the Xbox 360 version due to various PC technical issues that plagued me from playing online. PC MP was eventually played on a friends machine after some tweaking to get a half decent not so laggy game going. After 2 hours on the PC side with MP I saw enough to warrant my judgement on the PC side."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, only downside is just the lag on multiplayer, but mangable, totally worth it in the end."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,frezzes alot in campain video shots. laggs on mulitplayer. other than that its the best game ever made by call of duty 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, but have too lags!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no lag on my machine 1.5gb graphics car runs smooth on high settings must be your guys internet also no crashing issues also i7
Call of Duty: Ghosts,s'aight
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you have liked what call of duty has offered before interms of multiplayer, this one is probably for you. But be warned it isnt overly optimised for PC and is quite buggy sometimes considering the price tag. Fun all the same if you don't suck at it like myself :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Game! Though they need to fix the llag in this game, not server lag, but performance. I have a GT 740m which is a great and cheap graphics card, but I can only run at Normal Image quality and High Textures. Then you're thinking, High? Damn that's good! But I literally turned everything off like Depth of Field, FXAA, And all that.... I would very reccomend this game for anyone who wants a great multiplayer experience and cool gamemodes like Extinction."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will be the first to admit that the PC port of this game was a mess when it first launched. However, the recent patches have improved my experience substantially.  As for the game itself, I am going to post my review I did for the Murfreesboro Pulse as I write their video game reviews for them. It should be visible by the first week of December as the next issue has not been published yet.  'It is that time of year again for gamers. With November comes another Call of Duty, and with it, all the scorn, vitriol, and downright mind boggling hate toward it. Call of Duty Ghosts will not change that. If you hated this series before, there really is nothing here that is going to change that. If you like it, you will more than likely like this one, though I would not be surprised if quite a few were underwhelmed, and even disappointed. At least for this reviewer, the most disappointing aspect of Ghosts is its campaign. The story goes that you are part of an elite squad known as the Ghosts who are fighting back against the Federation. The Federation is an alliance of South American countries, who have managed to significantly weaken the United States to the point where they have a strong foothold in the south. While the premise may seem odd or even ridiculous, my hopes were pinned on the writer, Stephen Gaghan, who did one of my favorite political thrillers Syriana and who had also won an academy award for Traffic. Unfortunately those hopes were dashed.  As a fan of the Call of Duty campaigns, this iteration falls surprisingly short from the standards set by previous games. The writing is lackluster at best. The story gets you where you need to go, but does not compel you to care. It is predictable without being engaging, in large part due to the lack of character in this story. Case in point, there is hardly any character in Ghosts. The people you meet and fight with are, at least for the most part, stoic to the point of boredom. Even the voice acting is mostly bland and lacks passion, almost like they phoned it in at points, which surprising considering that Call of Duty usually nails that aspect of itself. Ironically, the non-human in the game, Riley the dog, ends up being more engaging and worthy of your attachment than the humans. On the flipside, though hardly compelling, the campaign itself is still entertaining enough to compel you to finish it. The set pieces continue to amaze and it provides a good variety of different sequences to keep you engaged. In fact, some of the more creative level designs of this franchise can be found here, from gun battles in space, battles under the sea, to very smooth tank battles, and even a stealth sequence in a bog that this reviewer found very engaging. Oh, and you get to sick the dog on soldiers. It never gets old! Whereas the campaign falls short, the multiplayer portion is where Ghosts stands back up and delivers in spades. Ghosts is probably the most refined Call of Duty experience yet. The overhauled engine looks very good and shows off much improved animations. An optional contextual lean element allows you to lean from cover whenever they aim down the sights, and a slide mechanism lets players slide when they are sprinting. While these may seem like gimmicks, they are actually clever gameplay elements that will force players to learn and master if they want to be among the better rankers. This reviewer had a first-hand account of such mastery. Upon dying, I saw my killerâ€™s killcam: he was coming up the stairs, sprinted to the window, slid to the side and then leaned down his sights and shot me. His/her timing was impeccable. The multiplayer itself is brimming with a stunning amount of content, refinements, and additions. While I cannot talk about all of them for the sake of brevity, I can rundown the major points that shine in this iteration. New modes such as Cranked and Blitz bring some unique variety. In Cranked, when you kill someone, you get bonuses to your character that last for 30 seconds. If you do not kill someone in that time frame, you die. This is great for discouraging camping. In Blitz, it is almost like a soccer match where you have to get to your opponentsâ€™ goal line to score while stopping them from getting to yours. I have found this mode to be quite fun. In-game there are field orders that you can grab upon an enemyâ€™s death that offer you a challenge such as getting a certain number of headshots or melee kills. Upon completion of such challenge, you receive an award in the form of replenished ammo and a care package. New and modified killstreaks along with surprisingly large and varied maps help to differentiate Ghosts from the pack. Those expecting the close quarters combat of previous titles are in for a surprise. One of the biggest overhauls though is the character customization and squads mode. You can now create your own solider down to their gender. It is not Skyrim level, but it at least allows for players to input their own personalities into the characters. Squads mode is where I will be finding myself spending the most time. The major draw point here is that you can now customize and build your own squad to take on other playersâ€™ squads. There is almost a simulation feel to the whole thing, though not quite at that point yet. For this reviewer though, the best thing about this mode is Safeguard. Building on one of my favorite modes in Modern Warfare 3, Survival, Safeguard is a horde mode where you hold out against increasing waves of enemies. Up to four players (up from two in MW3) must hold out as long as set, using guns, knives, care packages, and pretty much everything at your disposal. It is a lot of fun, though admittedly tough. The final and most unique addition to Ghosts has to be Extinction mode. Piggy backing off Nazi Zombies in previous games, you and up to three others must destroy alien hives while also holding off waves of alien foes. It may sound like another horde mode and in a sense it is, but it is more hectic and has its own style of play that will require multiple attempts and experimentation to master. A final note on multiplayer, thank you for bots! If you want to hone your skills or just do not care for playing against real players, this option is a godsend.  In the end, Call of Duty Ghosts comes down to, what are you looking for? A compelling campaign like the previous titles? Look elsewhere. Major shakeups to the Call of Duty formula? Nope. However, if you are looking for content and refinement in a slick package, you need not look further. Call of Duty Ghosts is the game for you. 4/5'  If you want to see more of my reviews, and with pictures, feel free to drop by the Pulse's video game page:  http://boropulse.com/category/movies-games/video-game-reviews/ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well executed single-player and a well executed multi-player. There are few games out there that offer these kinds of thrills and spills. Only reason its not a 9 is the lack of optimisation for the PC version and bugs which persist 10 days post release; that said the PC version is the best looking of all of the versions (of course). Suspect the negative reviews don't reflect reality for PC gamers.  Its Fun, its big.. and its worth the dosh."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fantastic game! I got it on sale and love it. I think the two styles of COD have a great merger in this edition.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty's so geeewdd
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a great game and has improved in many ways for the call of duty franchise many people hate this game for fun while it is good.  campaign- this campaign is brilliant it dosen't have the strongest story but it has the strongest gameplay campaign out of any call of duty , you can drive tanks, pilot choppers, play as a dog, have fire fights in space and underwater, repel down buildings etc. this campaign has brilliant and fun gameplay. the story focuses on two brothers their father and their dog and the story is interesting and cathces you in no doubt the story in not as good as the modern warfare series but it is still pretty good.  multiplayer- multiplayer is great, this games multiplayer has the best custumization system out of all the call of duty games with create a soilder system where you can create up to 10 soilders with their own class loadout, for your soilders you can custumize the look of your character play as a female or male where a green beret or a cap or helmet which clothes or play as fan favorites like soap, price, makarov, zakeav, keegan, merrick etc although the fan favorites you have to buy seperatly for a small price. then you can custumize your loadout with 6 weapon slots per soilder so for one weapon slot you can choose which weapon you want and what killstreaks and perks you want and the new perk system gives you more freedom also gun attachments and lethal and tactical equipment is their as well. this game has squad points which are very easy to earn by just playing online you can earn squad points and buy which gun you want and its attachments and perks etc so you don't need to wait to unlock a gun to use it just earn and few squad points done buy a gun. this game like all call of duties have a variety of fun game modes this game has alot of fun game modes such as cranked, hunted, infected etc. the maps are dynamic and big some peole don't like the big maps however there are also small maps and all the dlc's have small to meduim maps with great elements infact this call of duty has the best dlc's out of any call of duty game. Field orders are great and have alot in depth watch videos of field orders you will know what they do.   extinction- this is a brilliant game mode and the best part of call of duty ghosts extinction has fast paced action a variety of hostiles rank up system prestiging relics ,armoury upgrades class loadouts and alot of team is their in extinction. its alot of fun. the first map point of contact was simple and fun that was when extinction was just getting started then nightfall came out they had new wonder weapon called the venom x, the had some lockers, a brillant story exticntion has you can collect intel can watch video clips of the storyline. Nightfall also has the 2nd largest boss in cod history the breedor which you have to defeat. then in extinction the next map mayday was awesome the best extinction map it had buildables, 4 variations of the venom x, more aliens or cryptids more intel to continue the story and the largest boss in extinction and cod history the kraken which is such a amazing boss battle then the next two maps have more thing also you can see for yourself  squads- this has a ton of content in it it has safe guard, squad assault, squad vs squad etc it gives you more reply value and more content for this cod package.  overall a great cod game one of the best of course not better then cod 4 but this game is very well done I think this game is great."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like the game but it is so laggy any tips to change thst
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"very good game,I like this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Save your cash. *I only did the campaign here, MP may be a different story* The game was really graphically appealing, gorgeous even. The storyline was quite compelling and interwoven among the different 'characters' as is apparently the norm now. That's about it with the good.  I beat the game, in about five hours. The almost 30GB storage made me think it was a large game (implying long) but nope, that's for all the damned textures and cutscenes. The story was good, but the epic moments came when you breach a door and the whole game slows. Why? Because the main storyline is horrible. Ghosts refers to special ops people that are really the best-of-the-best (I'll stick with vagueries so I don't spoil it) and you *shocker* are on your way to becoming one. As for being the baddest cat around, you sure do suck. What's that? An explosion, let me fall down and need someone else to help me up. A pack of wolves attack us, let me shoot them in the...gah it's attacking me and my only hope is to tap a key long enough for a dog to save me. Grrr. Such a bad@$$ and you spend cutscene after cutscene being a little wimp that other people have to help.  I'm glad I bought it on a half-priced weekend, if I paid full price I would be a bit upset. In that frame of mind, I would recommend this game, it does look good and the story is fun, just ignore the annoying parts that make your uber character seem wimpy and light some bad guys up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is very fun espeacially when you play coop 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun game, good come back from a few bad years of CoD games. Just wish there was a larger PC community"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is good, fun, and worth playing over many other games, just 1 problem, not enough people on at one time so could take up to an hour to find a game:/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too many hackers in this game ! needs dedicated servers to be able to control some of this !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Beware of Graphic let downs, funny unrealistic campaign scences, but same as all COD's Adictive..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game work fine on 4 GB ram i love this my friend share it to me will buy it for 60$ 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's a awesome game, play it everday insce i bought it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This FPS game is awesome instead of zombies from the earlier frachise it has ALIENS!!! And its freacking awesome...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Like all COD's they are very addictive and inspire creativity. How to manipulate the controls of the game and reflexes to give you a edge over the opponents. Even though quick-scoping, drop-shots, and halo jumps are still imminent part of game play, I think that they have done a good job on making COD a addicting game with a cool story line. There are still many pieces of equipment that are severely over powered and I feel that i have been lied to when the changes of the game are addressed. Ghosts still HAS many issues I would still recommend it to a newbie. I would give this COD two or three stars because of the changes needed and the poor optimization given to us PC gamers. This is for a newbie until some major changes are made and I think ITS TIME TO STEP UP COD!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you have played a Call of Duty game since the release of Big Red or anything after you already know how this game feels. It follows the footsteps of every other CoD game made. If you enjoy a few hours of fun but short story mode with shoot-em-up grinding kills and big explosions then the game might be worth a shot if you manage to get a deal. The price tag is obviously too high, I mean way too high. This is like waking up without your pants in a shopping mall fountian with three half eaten bags of cheetos high. The multiplayer is not as fun as previous games. I personally find it a lot harder to pick out players from the background and at this time (Later 2014) there isn't more than 3000 players on at a time, mostly European. There isn't a whole lot of familiar guns but many variations like the Ak-12 (to the AK-47) and some others. In sums:  -Short but fun story -Dying online community -Guns not commonly used in other games (Good or bad depending on what you like) -Majority of skins require you to buy them each at 1.99   If you can pick this game up at under $20 USD then give it a shot if not, don't bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really bad... but addicting. I regret buying it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,extinction is fun. the campaign is boring.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think this game is amazing! I like many other people hated it at first but eventualy warmed up to the idea of a new futuristic game. I totally recommend this gamee.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Story was ok.                   Not saying anything about that Multiplayer................................
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game kicks â™¥â™¥â™¥,cant wait for Advanced Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the online play on this game is dreadful, looks ok campain is ok"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I got this game for the scopes.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,big problems with sound with win 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun, what I can play anyway.... I seem to be plagued by a fairly bad bug, where I freeze on a specific mission loading screen, but what I have played is very fun and pretty interesting, better than the Modern Warfare series, almost on par with the Black Ops series. Guns are good, sounds are very nice, graphics are pretty (On the highest settings though) but this bug is seriously hurting its quality. I won't even bother doing a pro/con since I have only played the first 2 missions and a little offline bots. The overall right now is pretty bad at 4.5/10 because of this bug. If I could play the game, it would bump up to 6/10 already, then after finishing the game I can only imagine what it'd be. Only reason I recommend is in hopes you don't suffer the same bug."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'The core of the game is very good, but the very high max ping in the game (800) and bad spawn placements can make the game very frustrating at time.. other than those 2 things, the game is really awesome.'  After months of no performance patches and fixes, I have to say DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  It runs sparatically. Frame rates drop, and the spawns are unbarable. People will spawn withing 10 feet of each other and sometimes right on their screen. The ping and lag is also unbarable unless you live in the most populated areas. I am in south korea, but I can even get a decent connection to japan and china. I have heard a lot of issues on US servers too though. The game will often connect someone into the game that is very far from the others in the same game. This all makes for a lot of frustration."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.. do we can devolp?? Don't buy this game at pc. how about console?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game keeps crashing, this is not a hardware issue. Its a software issue, my computer never crashes for other games i play"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very nice game but like always too small maps:( anyway good job
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is very good game but there needs to be better controls on Multiplayer cheets. There seems to be a lot of boosting and cheating going on when you play Multiplayers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Greate game of all time. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why it's say that i need to install stem?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the usual... fun with friends, gets frustrating as usual but yeah"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Exactly what I expected from a CoD game. I like it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst of the Cod games i suggest that they should give up there jobs and drive of a bridge plz
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think that this COD Game is possibly the best off the lot since WAW and COD 4, it has something for all gamers who enjoy FPS's.  I see a lot of negativety towards this game, all I can say is that those who given this 1 a thumbs down have not played all the Call of Duty games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great graphics, but feels clunky in the multiplayer game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a competive gamer that played alot of FPS and have played in about 50 lans over the years i thought to give cod ghost a chance. I have played alot of Q1 Q3a quakelive but also warcraft 2 starcraft and starcraft 2.  So is cod ghost a game that can be used in esport. Quite simply my answer is no.  What reasons?  1. the game doenst seem to be in real time. What i mean is i shoot at people i see myself shoot 3-4 times. I die, In the kill cam i do not get one shot of. There a a few vods on youtube demonstrating this. That player a see opponent for 12 frames and wins. player b only has 5 frames and dies while they are in direct vision with each other. Can you imagine quakecon finals Evil vs Rapha and the game is not in sync? Its unbelieveble that this is possible never had this with other fps games. There even vods on youtube where you look one direction. Suddenly opponent appears not around the corner but already 2-3-4 meter in open sight. While you are focused on looking at that corner.  2. No ping, you have a clanwar lets say you equal to each other but you cannot check if a server has fair ping. No point in playing ping matters. even in public with the random changing of servers one game you go 40-1 next game you go 20-10 cause ping changed.  3. FPS no way to measure fps or to go above fixed amount. Discussed quite alot on the forums. Its widely accepted in quake community that 125 fps constant is a standard for proper play.  4. I have a computer where I spend 2700 euro on. Top of the line. I can play with max settings. But you do not want to play with max settings as its very hard to see your opponent then. You are forced to use low settings in order to make it playeble.  5. Rushing in this game is possible vs noobs but vs equal opponents you die easy defenders bonus is huge.  6. Every weapon so strong you die very fast. if first 3 points where no issue maybe this would be okay but with al the issues its makes the gameplay bad and frustating.  7.You cannot spectate a game you will be kicked for being idle. after about 1 min.  8. Community not able to make there own maps. I even got e-mail for IW saying they made new cool maps please pay 16 euro and you have 3 extra map possible to play in multiplayer. I mean WTF? IW you serious?  9. Game is designed for Consule there is a sort of skill cap that is reached fast. very beginner friendly perhaps explain populairty?  10. 65 fixed fov. just LOL. you need to download a 3rd party program to get bigger fov how uniteresed in esports most IW be to do this?  11. Auto joining severs. And auto rejoining other servers while playing. I want to be able to scroll in what server to join. I want to see ping and i want to see what players on that server are they any good or not? quakelive has such a good function for this.  12. I loved it when playing i could go to spec mode. I find someone better then myself. I like to see how he plays usually duels but also could be tdm or ca i spec and look how he plays see what decision he makes. not a possibility in cod ghost.  13. Dieing doenst give you a disadvandtedge in the game you just spawn with full health and full ammo and your primary weapon. there is no farming of weapons or armor in the game. Ofcourse this is a cod ghost and makes it more noob friendly. I remember how much you had to play in team games in my old q1 and q3 clans to lock down a map properly control the main weapons control the armors. Know where the spawns are it was magic when you locked map down and went on kill spree. Opponent really had to play smart and take over area's one by one to get back in the game.   14. No duel. But in cod whats the point to it. without any of the farming element.   15. Is it me only or do bullets make no sense. I can stand behind stone wall and bullets pass. I stand behind a tree and bullets cannot pass. It seems very random in how bullets penetrate wall elements. On top of this the same wall in an other map bullets dont go trough so this should be standardisded.   16. Cheaters my god there alot of them. There players i reported 3 weeks ago that i see shooting trough 3 buildings on far side of the map killing people. Going 60-0 in a TDM match having K/D ratios of 30+ I reported these people as there is a function in there you can do it what i thought was really cool. 3 weeks later i see the same person still doing it being in top 100 of the ladder by now. IW doenst seem to do anything with the reports.   17. Connectivity issues. Sometimes you can play 4 hours not disconnects. Then suddenly 1 or 2 hours longs you just disconnect after playing a minute or so in the game.  Is the game fun to play?  I thought it was fun for about the first 100 hours of multiplayer till above issues where clear to me and started to anoy me to much to enjoy the game. I think IW should look how to make a proper FPS game and look at ID Software and creators of half life.  Anyways i am back to playing starcraft 2 and quakelive. I hope there is a game devolper out there willing to make a new proper FPS game that is fast paced like quake. Designed with the goal of multiplayer and esports.   Update. 29-6  Somehow i keep playing this game. Fortunantly the lag, fps and drops have been fixed. Gameplay is strangely atracting me:) Still alot of thing can be improved to make it better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only reason to play this game is for extinction mode.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"LIKE THE GAME,BUT DIRECT X 11 NOT WORKINH! HOWDO I GET IT FIXED? "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought this game while I was drunk because I was mad at myself. Best form of self punishment ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ok here is my point of view regarding cod ghosts. It is lots of fun seing some new items and camo packs for a change and still highly entertaining playing with a group of friends. Ranking up is not hard at all but be prepared to get flamed by other players if you go the camping route and if your new to first person shooters :) . Overall i would recomend it and it is really worth trying out. But thats just my thoughts.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun campaign game to play, however, it follows the usual COD format that we have all become use too. A new approach to this sort of game campaign would be great, instead of just go to this point, kill this person, and get out before this bomb explodes.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Having a blast.... Focused on my studies, but nice to take a break and take my mind off school!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yeah seems legit though its really choppy on my pc even when i optimize it but yeah its good to play.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same'O Same'O. maps are just too dull. not enough variation. play the ones that came before it. this one, at $29.99 is not even worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"call of duty 1% the other was better then me, the other 95% bull $h?t"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Almost as much fun a MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is quite fun, even if it is a run and gun with no strategy at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"lot's of FPS bug's, and video setting bugs, but after you get past it all, and get into the 5 to 10 lobies thats in the game, its alright."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cod Ghosts has a very good story line i dont care what others have to say about it i thought it was good or i should say way better than black ops 2 story still dont understand it to this day
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is worth it provided you have a good graphics card . i say gtx 700 series or better and matched with the raedon equilivant, There are many well planned aspects and the overall design of the game leads to endless possiblities such as the new COD ghosts app for andriod etc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I quite enjoyed teh single player and found that it was not long enough for me but still the same I enjoyed it.  on the down side - The multi-player is a let down, you die way to easily and its a average console game where you run around (sprinting) shooting anything that moves, there is no team work or tactics invloved in this type of game so the more mature player will be disapointed and I found that spawning with campers right behind me reall made it so frustrating to play, to the point of that I am now deleting the game and will be gifting it to my nephew, again while the single player version is well worthy of playing, I wish the dev's could have put as much effort into the mulit-player as they have the single player game.  To sum up:  Truly disapointed with this release.. Enjoyed the Single player... No Tactics or team work.... Run in shooting... Boring multi-player"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"really liked this game, so much better then BF4, consistant connections and stable internet, great game overall, give it 8 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun game, but to much campers :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lag game i cant runnit on exta omfg! i run black ops 2 every this maxed with a little over 100 fps but in ghost with normal i run 30-46 OMFG!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Simply put: I liked Call Of Duty Ghosts.   Still with me? Screaming 'You're just a damn CoD fanboy'? Well there's nothing I can do, since you're on the other side of the screen. But yes, I do like Ghosts. I've had a pretty rocky history with CoD. I started playing with Modern Warfare, and I loved it. It still remains in my heart as one of the best online shooters ever. I feel like things took another road with Modern Warfare 3. I liked the story, but everything else... you know what I mean. I played all the way through the series ending with Black ops 2, and I felt done with CoD. But as many others did, they bought Ghosts for the hell of it. And while others see Ghosts as bringing the beloved series to a downfall, I think the changes were for the best.   I played this originally on PC, and later on Xbox One. Both systems had the same quality game, but PC had... problems. The game had an awful launch. The lack of dedicated servers, horrible optimization, and changes no one liked, it was destined to be doomed. While all of those things should've been ready on day one (and they weren't), it's fixed now. I can run the game like a champ, and it's great on performance. Still with the lack of dedicated servers though, it's a small issue.  I enjoyed the campaign. I don't really need to get into that. It was original, and it was fresh.  The online multiplayer is where we all resort to though in the end. Putting it frank, it works. The PC version is probably the worst as far as the community goes though. Only 4-6 thousand people online on a good night (46k players on a slow Monday morning on XB1) makes this horrible to find matches. I'm sure even the Wii U has more dedicated players. Just throwing this out there too, don't buy any DLC, because you'll be lucky to find any matches with that DLC. But once you can get into a match, things are usually okay, if hackers aren't present. But one of my favorite things is also something everyone hates: the large maps. I've been playing the Battlefield series for years, and I love the vast size of those maps. While Ghosts maps aren't nearly as big, they're big enough to have good spawn spots and such. Sure, camping isn't the greatest thing ever, but sometimes you just need to overcome them and be a good team player. At least, I was able to, in my 30+ hours into the online alone. I think customization is great too. While character creators aren't really needed in a game like this, it's a fresh spin for newcomers. The guns feel great, and sound amazing.   Then, you have some other modes that, unfortunately you won't be able to touch on the PC version due to the lack of players. The 'Squads' mode sounded truly unique. You can create a squad, and have those AI players go into other peopleâ€™s games, and try to beat them. You would train each AI character in the regular online mode, and when you felt they were ready, you'd send them into Squads. As I mentioned though, this cool RPG like mode isn't usable, because no one uses it. Extinction mode is also a very fresh new mode. Like Zombies from WaW, Blops and Blops 2, you'll be fending off against aliens trying to invade Earth. Sound generic? It's really not. You'll make your own custom loadouts, and it's crucial to play with other players, because it's it gets pretty hectic. It also consists of its own campaign, and it continues through the DLC packs. Again though, no one plays this mode, so it's sort of a lost cause. If you play on Xbox or Playstation though, I doubt you won't be able to have a good time.  So in short, the PC version did (and still) has problems. But with some of the best gunplay around, Ghosts is a fantastic entry to the Call of Duty franchise.   8/10 +Great Campaign +Best Online Gunplay +Cool modes -Lack of PC players -Hackers...  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"On the campaing i expected more from Infinity ward, but it was good, points 1-6 * I give Cod Ghost Story point 4. Multiplayer is VERY good .. Points 6  All the other modes are interresting, have not tried the out properly yet .. but so far so good!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its an alright COD, I like it plays with no lag downside is that there are many hackers that just like to show off. Extinction is awesome and funy pass time when you get angered by hackers. All in all good game, but wait till it goes on a sale. Thats when this games worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's not actually that bad, the weapons are all pretty balanced and the maps are decent"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After playing a decent amount of this game, I have come to the conclusion that I would rather lick Gaben's belly button then waste another $60 dollars on a CoD game. It's fun though...sometimes..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is 'okay'.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Thank you for wasting my money.  -Whiteboy7THST
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game , '' got me ''."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes, its a great way to kill time. Of course i got used to the graphics of BF4 but this is by no means far from it.  Nice short games, small maps, no vehicles. I love it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't worry, I don't feel pain anymore."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"4/10 - Not worth the money. It has improved graphics but that's not enough for you to purchase the game. In fact, the graphics are improved so much, players can't handle it thus rendering the multiplayer experience useless."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I LIKE THE GAME,I`AM A MILITARY RETIRED,I PLAY WIHT MOUSE AND KEY BOARD COMAMS KING OF SLOW SOME TIMES."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very in depth single player game. Nice content , and array of weapons to try"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very disappointed on how it kicks alot of people i know with nVidia cards. if you dont have the most up to date Pc you SOL. I enjoyed the single player the multiplayer needed alot of work.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"By far the best COD ever, IMO, as far as Multiplayer is concerned.   So many beautiful details that make playing this game such a pleasure. F.ex. knifing, team matesÂ´ call outs, perk selection, map design, graphics, SOUND, and overall realistics.   (What I HATE is ... Riot shieldÂ´s overpowerment (shoot him in the back - he feels nothing), and ... BAD PING. Also when u leave an automatically-selected-map (for what ever reason), and search again, only to be put straight back to that same map u just left, having no choice of stopping the download.)   Overall ... Man, what a pleasure this game is to play !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like Cod Ghosts overhaul fast gameplay a nice variety of guns there is place for improvment, but is a very nice game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun. Audio problems sometimes, but game is fun and has a good story."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I haven't played this game since its release. All it does is crash and freeze. It freezes on my computer, my friends' computers. This is a console game through and through. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Everyone is entitled to there game of choice so if you do not like COD you know what to do... Game On!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love the game but i cant play it that often because i dont have the right amount of space 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the only game where dogs are stronger than soldiers  12/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The COD franchise should have a moto,if you like camping go buy it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No better than the others in terms of gameplay etc,. worse weapons and no one seems to be playing it on the PC anymore - very hard to find matches espescially when in a party.  Not surprised lots of people still playing MW2 !!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD:Ghost is great, but like all that came before, to many people cheating, not enough people playing. personally i hope this game not the genre has run it's course. Fans argued for dedicated servers, with some ability to kick/ban cheaters but nothing is done. Just as reporting a player on steam, it as well seems as if nothing is done. I for one believe i have bought my last cod game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always been a fan of the Call of Duty games, I am however new to steam. I recently purchased COD: Ghosts and came to find that the split screen option is unavailable. I find this to be a rip off due to the fact that we pay full price for this game and a feature that you would get buying the game for a console is disabled, I would not recomend that anyone buy this game because this is unacceptable and frankly I feel that I've been scammed out of my hard earned money on this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I know that this review is gonna get me a lot of flame, but I believe that this game, aside from the bad optimization and low fov, actually has some value to it.  Let me put it simply. The singleplayer is not bad, although I ran into the game crashing on one mission and I wasn't able to progress past that point. That's a big problem and isn't acceptable for a next gen game. But what I want to focus on is the multiplayer.  The multilayer has 3 aspects: normal PvP, Squads, and Extinction. As you can see from my hours spent, I have quite the amount of time spent in it, and all of it thanks to what I think the saving grace of this game is: Squads.  What is Squads exactly? Squads mode is bassically a multiplayer mode that allows ou to level a virtual squad that can be used in the regular multiplayer. This comes in three flavors: Safeguard, Squad Assult and my personal favorite: Wargame. What this allows you to do is to play the normal multiplayer BUT against bots.  Now, A lot of people might think of it to be vitriolic to play with bots, but for people with a slow internet connection and who live nowhere near where games are being played it's the only option. The bots are smart, fairely competent and are quite fun to play with due to the fact that they dont flash bm or yell at you for stupid reseaons. For people like me who don't have the ping to play compeititvely online, this was a saviour as it gave me the Call of Duty experiance that I wanted without having to suffer from terrible lag.  Yes, there is optimization problems, yes, the fov is bad, but for me, as a person who loves playing by himself the squads mode was enough to fill my 100+ hours of multiplayer experiance. And I'm still not done with it.  The other mdes, such as Extinction and Safeguard are really good to solo, where Safeguard actually gives you an extra AI squad member to play with so it's not insanely imbalanced.  So if you are like me and love playing with bots (I know your out there), then this game isn't a bad choice. Mechanically, it sound and the graphics, although dated, is not exactly hideous. But I recommend buying it with caution, esspecially if you have fov problems.  So not a hearty recommendation, but if you just want to play by yourself and don't mind 30 fps and the fov, then it's a safe buy.  EDIT: I realize that my review doesn't show how many multiplayer hours I spent, but as of today, I have spent 155 hours in the multiplayer. Quite amaing for a crappy game, no?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Someone needs to blow this dev studio up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dude wheres devastatoin?! its may 8!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes its a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To all those who complains in this AWESOME game!!!  I have a tip for you.... upgrade your PC!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Definitely not worth Â£40, but I like shooting people and this is the game to do it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"even i got gaming pc ( i7 , 780 , 32 gb ram) but multiplayer also can make me hang and dc... pls fix this problem . thx.. ( my other friend also got this problem..)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the game alot since I am a COD fanboy xD here are the pros and cons Pros -Really intretaining multiplayer experience -You can play for hours and hours -Decent single player campaign  -OK graphics  Cons -Horrible maps with alot of fogg -Sometimes its really laggy -Not alot of people play the game so it takes forever to find a game -Not alot of maps and very few gamemodes  from 1/10 I would give this game like a 7 and would recommend only poeple who like first persons shooters to buy this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Has a great campaign, the multiplayer however is pretty stale, always the same two maps. And there is almost no online community to try out the new features such as squads, or extinction. Would recommend for a single player fps exerience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game if they would just get rid of the laggg!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game made me sad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game the best of all call of duty love it ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,new to the franchise...aaaand i'm gone. bye money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign was interesting and entertaining, it was definately a different feeling from the other games in the series. 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is strictly for HARDCORE COD fans....only they will appreciate this title... SOLID SINGLE PLAYER, way better than previous camapigns. 7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To many hackers.....   Please do something to stop the aimbot and wallers.   This has been going on for years and yet nothing is done. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,decent multyplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game had great potential, but fell short of previous titles. Lack of attention to PC players is frustrating, lobby wait times are long, hackers are frequent, and population is low. It seems the PC FPS is dying out to cheaper consoles. While decent overall, it could have been much better with more developer support."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just want to say that I have played most, if not all COD games ever released since Call Of Duty 1 and I enjoy the fast paced competitiveness of the multiplayer. With that being said, I was very hesitant to buy this game after playing the abomination called, MW3, which is in my opinion, the worst COD game ever made, perhaps the worst fps ever made. Cod ghosts is leaps and bounds far superior to Mw3; better guns, maps, sound design, less lag compensation etc.... My biggest issue with ghosts on the pc is the limited FOV, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor visibility, and how quickly I get killed, feels like I die in two shots. Also, the maps with a few exceptions are pretty bad with a lot of camping spots. This game is not even close to being as bad as most people claim, especially from the pc community. It has some major issues as I stated earlier, but it's still a fun game, reminds me of mw2, which is my favorite in the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I want the extra extinction maps, but $15 for each is crazy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good hard core graphic i enjoyed vry much :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is ok and i would recommend it but i would only get it when it goes on sale
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"GET IT, or ELSE!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you don't have any optimization issues (like me), and now that they have added the FOV slider, then you'll find that this is a meh COD game with a crappy PC port. This is not worth the price tag even with the 'Gold Edition' price, and Black Ops II is the better PC COD, but this is still fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you didnt get the season pass, your going to have a bad time. $130 dollars just to get every DLC?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this game but i get weird graphic flickering
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's OK at best. Haven't played much campaign yet but meh it's call of duty, same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ different story-line. Multiplayer - Meh, camp or hack. I wish i would have waited until it was on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD: Ghost is a good game overall, the only problem is the graphics, but you don't play COD for graphics so don't except anything else"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alot of people say they hate this game but i would say this game is not bad at all . the reason people say this game is a peice of crab is becuz they die to quickly and that makes every player in the game angry so i believe this game should put thier health up 100% to make it fair !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a novice FPS Gamer. Played a little on the XBox360 but tend to have shyed away on the pc favouring strat, moba, adventure and rpg. Well bought this in the Steam Sale. Well, i'm really glad i bought this game. Check your pc can run it. (i only say that because it was in the top10 of graphics intensive pc games in a list i saw). The graphics are brilliant. i'm enjoying the Single Player storyline and is very forgiving on low difficulty so if you're rusty or just don't play many fps and want to give one a shot i'd definitely recommend this. Many different side elements have you in space floating and jetpacking around shooting enemies, repelling down buildings, controlling your attack dog to stealthily attack enemies, flying helicopter gunships to take out targets, using long range sniper rifle, using a silenced pistol with movement locator to take out enemies, aswell as normal assault rifle stuff in different stages of the sp storyline. still playing through the sp storyline so probably a lot more. All i can say is it's fun and coupled with the forgiving aspect, i'd definitely give it 10/10. If you're an experienced fpser i'd probably suggest you read another review for a more relevant opinion on the higher difficulty settings. I normally prefer multiplayer aspect of games (theres something sterile to me playing against bots but being a story its different) and have only tried the extinction mode mp with bots and for a very short time so cant really comment on the mp apart from saying its frenetic-i'll get round to playing mp with other players when ive finished sp storyline(campaign) i expect.. if i'd known the game was like this i'd have bought it full price earlier. there's lots of dlc mp i believe but not bought any yet. only had this game a relatively short period but loving it. jfi i'm using a 360 controller on my pc. it's a great, fun game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"yes, its a well thought out game with lots of things to pick from.the only down side is the ammount of people playing..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is amazing i love it i allways recomend all cod games these ones are allways better than black ops ones semperfi :D and i would like strikezone as a map to allways play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the vibe of the game. Fun to play with friends but not very good in the solo mode.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool game. Like the campain mode. but a bit laggy when showing a video between gameplay
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is so good!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome campain the multiplayer is OK but it is a great game highly recamend it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont know why the â™¥â™¥â™¥ everyone is mad your game is crashing THEN GET A BETTER DAMN COMPUTER thats what i did and it runs with little to no lag   Only problem is the Multiplayer The campagin was great to me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best War Game, I Have EVER played!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you've played any of the call of duty games then this game won't seem like anything new...However, if you enjoy playing the cod series then you will like it...Great weapons. Could be a bit better optimized for PC but still delivers the goods.. Found this game to be much more enjoyable with a lobby of good friend/players...Be careful though..A few 'hacked lobbies' have created false VAC bans on some players that do not cheat and Activision and infinity ward won't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it, or state why, or give proof of the infraction. Although I know many have cheated and been caught, which we do applaud, some players have been thrown in hacked lobbies and paid the price later with a Ban..beware.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Ghosts Is A Descent Game In The Franchise. Its nothing particularly special but is a nice addition to the fps genre. On pc there isnt a massive community but about 2-5thousand players playing regularly all the time. (so getting in a game takes a matter of seconds as if it was on console. I have A Youtube Review With Gameplay If You Would Like To Check It Out First Hand. XD Thanks          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Call Of Duty Ghosts PC Review ToDMeRkIn94&nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The first call of duty game i ever play, one of the best games i played so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game absolutely love the series.. HOWEVER, the COD Ghosts for pc is very hard for the pc to run. The makers of this particular game in the series made it a little to intense for the pc gaming industry. I had to go back to playing cod black ops II. It runs smoother than Ghosts. Please use this reference in the future "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is legit! I've been loving it! Graphics and game play are awesome!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is a good game, but if you played alot of console before this then you'll get demolished"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is my favorite COD game because the graphics and gameplay are superb.  This and COD MW2 are the two best in the series but Ghosts is more polished  and offers more fluid gameplay, better assortment of weapons and perks to purchase,  and cool maps that tailor to any playing style, especially snipers or gamers like myself  that are slow and need cover/concealment to combat quicker and more skilled opponents.  I spent 100+ hrs on PS3 version but PC version of Ghosts is the best due to the beautiful graphics and more responsive keyboard/mouse controls. Please do not let the negative hype of other gamers scare you away from this gem - this is the best COD game on the market and offers tons of replay value in the mulplayer mode. The single player campaign is superb also and it has a great story to it. Cheers from Ringo!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game if you enjoy a variety of stealth missions 'hint the name ghosts' idk if it is worth it if you do not enjoy campains, but if you do, it is defintely one of the most sophisicated games of the call of duty games"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible at launch but updates are making this game playable
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Enjoying the game, but I prefer Black Ops II, as a multiplayer: however, the Extinction mode is very enjoyable to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too many hackers in MP. In every lobby i see one at least. So sad. This game haven't anticheat as well. GJ devs. UR da best. Nice game with lovely mechanics was ruined by hackers. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. Enjoy it. Play it, if you prefer â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up COD series like me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love the game but i cant play it that often because i dont have the right amount of space 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,iyts amazing only thinhg i wish for is survival mode on extinction like on zombies i wish it was there hopefully they add it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game a must buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game have 2 place in cod games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great FPS game, but not as good as Black Ops 2"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not good. Buy black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm absolutely sick of the blatant hacking. The rooms are emtying because you can't even enjoy a fair match.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,AWESOME GAME. love the story line. gfx engine was alot like cod4 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thad game is only Cool, all haters are stupid -_-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i dont like this game, i dont reccomend.... but why im still buying cod series.... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ._."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game so much a little lag but fun but really take off the hackers and cheaters thats not fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but not as playable as the other IW games....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game. Love the story and the action!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really really good game just need the pc to run it probly
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Multiplayer!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another CoD title fro IW, great graphics, good gameplay as always with IW. INteresting campaign in a wide array of settings, although pretty short, unless you want to do a lot of multiplayer a 4-5 hour campaign might not be worth the money. New 'zombies' mode looks interesting. All in all it'll come down to the MP as with most CoD games. 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dear haters of Call of Cuty: Ghosts.   If you say CoD ghosts sucks because of the blurr in the graphics there is a way to fix that. All you need to do is go to the options, video, advanced options, and raise the FoV all the way up and that will make it go away."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dude. Bro. Yeah. It's COD, Jim, and just as we know it. You come to COD for the AAA Action movie experience and it doesn't disappoint. Awe-inspiring settings, mad and pointless plotting, oodles of toys and a multiplayer where you can get called horrible names by 11-year-olds. Will it change your life? Good grief, no. But you'll enjoy the ride, and that's what COD is."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Playing COD since its origins, this new game lacks difficulty, I wont even mess with the graphics, I like a good game challenging and the pretty things add points, but I like challenge this no challenge at all. The previous release (Black Ops II), I remember took more than 2 days to complete on Veteran Mode. This one took me 8 hrs. Multiplayer has some cool stuff.. but definitely this is not the best COD ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm absolutely sick of the blatant hacking. The rooms are emtying because you can't even enjoy a fair match.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,AWESOME GAME. love the story line. gfx engine was alot like cod4 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thad game is only Cool, all haters are stupid -_-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is the best game ever 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i do die a lot mire then i kill in this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its great :)!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,works for me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game but is it any different then the last is it really
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very nice but needs more maps!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Thos is an awesome game. Highly reccommended!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Graphics are pathetic 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice Game but not the best COD at least.... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros: The Singleplayer Campaign is longer. The Graphics looks amazing. Good Characters. New Weapons.  Cons: Unrealistic Gun sounds. Same old Call of Duty game. Maps too large for 12 Players. Call of Duty App is not available in some regions. Ghosts is not optimized for PC, Stuttering, FPS Drops, Screen Tearing, Low Texture Mode, Crashing and Bluescreen problems. Have to wait too long for updates.  Verdict: Call of Duty: Ghosts is a great game but poorly optimization makes it harder to play. If you can't deal with this problems don't buy until the developers fix this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice 1person shooting game, good multiplayer with a lot off russian hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,you die too fast in this game;s multi player. but thats the challenging and fun part
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"one off the best of call of duty, i like all the games call of duty, you guys keep coming with more your the best a friend the brickman P.R."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its BAJS JUST TEST IT I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a vanilla FPS game what more is there to say
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a pretty nice shooter as we got used from Call of Duty series. Mostly is a story of the Ghosts, but especially of 2 brothers. The end of the game is pretty weird and unexpected."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is a rly good game if u playn mw3 then u will like this most pll who dislike it are new to the cod srireis
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hello all Call of Duty Haters!. So I've Bought this game because I heard alot Negative and positive things about it. Well in my opinion This game isnt Close to be so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as people say. The Storyline was Really good and really Grabbed me and my friend. so well, The Multiplayer is okay aswell. Maybe not the best as COD MW2-MW3 but not bad and I find it funny to play.   I would say that this game is Good and worth buying. #â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ haters &lt;3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"my review is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game and steam,,,full of hackers,,,and steam dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,,,,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very recommend
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game has a potential but need a lot of work til done
Call of Duty: Ghosts,realy good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Help!! I rebuilt my windows 7 pc.. Same hardware that COD Ghosts used to work on.. Now continually crashes. I have a dual monitor and it just starts flickering then ... you guessed it, it freezes. Not sure as I have everything the same and it worked, now reinstalling 7 it's a no show. Can anyone help?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I dont like the fact that the squads fight on there own when im away frm my computer. It hurts my record, and i get NO squad points, just XP points. (give me squad points) or just fix it to where it will not effect my record, then they can fight."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am a MW fan and I thougth it was the time for an upgrade. I was wrong. This game is not finished. I am having a high end gaming grid gtx 690 16 gig ram i7 and I am having LOW FPS, frequent freezes, lag... This is terrible. I am really sorry that i paid so much before reading any of the reviews and boufgt the freaking hardened pack... Listen to other reviewers and STAY THE F AWAY!  EDIT - Both game updates and Hardware updates right now made this game work smoothly with ultimate details. I had i7 920 CPU, it was bottlenecking the whole system. I have updated the mainboard and the cpu and game is running real good on i7 4770K along with 690 gtx.   I really like the game now. It is very advanced, and the levelling works like anything else before it. I can only recommend this if you have a FAST SYSTEM WITH A FAST GRAPHICS CARD. OTHERWISE STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Playing COD since its origins, this new game lacks difficulty, I wont even mess with the graphics, I like a good game challenging and the pretty things add points, but I like challenge this no challenge at all. The previous release (Black Ops II), I remember took more than 2 days to complete on Veteran Mode. This one took me 8 hrs. Multiplayer has some cool stuff.. but definitely this is not the best COD ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Like this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty good graphics and game play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its getting cost to mutch. for what u not get. is plesure:S i hope cod fix teir connection problems soon 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not the worst... but not the best either cuz it does have new features and a good campaign but it's just the same game with different guns, maps, dlcs, and play-styles..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love the game. Play it everyday. Just wish they'd punish the hackers!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is my first computer game FPS and i have to say it is VERY good i dont know why people hate on this game if the graphics are bad get a better graphics card they will look amazing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Need a high-end PC to run a game that looks only slightly better than Blops 2.   Cool support streaks, fun modes, same mechanics.   Dogs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Agree there was no ghosys or ghostbusters im sad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i think that the high expectations from ghosts led to a really low critic which i can't fully understand. the campaign is real fun and adds some new features wasn't there before. the multiplayer, which is the main thing, also adds great new stuff and is with a very similar gameplay to the old ones, only i feel that ghosts actually tries to be realistic, much more than BO2 for example. the main reason people left CoD for games like BF3 is the realism mechanics, and when CoD tried to retrive them, they get a bang from thier own people, well thats funny. the truth is that black ops 2 multi was pure fun - gun and run game style. i mean yes, was hell of a fun, but when u check ghosts out its much more real and have a good feeling to it. and when u add the hardcore mode on ghots, come on its ridiculos. GOOD.  i played most shooters from 2006 or so, and i like this game very much, so its recommended.  btw, people who play bf3,4 like to rate COD low automatic, even after 1 hour of gameplay, just cause they are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but these are two completly diff games. u should try both of them, take what u like and continue with ur life. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this game. It runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really good game i love it. need more weapons.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I won't bash this game as I like it a lot, but I will say that when I picked it up it was a little broken. Plenty of things have been further optimized and patched for PC and since picking up the Onslaught DLC it runs just about perfectly when my settings are properly adjusted for the type of laptop I use."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"when i got this game, people told me that it would be crap. my opinion is that it is awesome. the multiplayer is great and in the new dlc, you get to be michael meyers on the map fog. this game is something i would deffinately reccomend."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lots of fun. Even more when you get the seasons pass
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, so there are a lot of reviews where people are just complaining. Typically it's from game freezing or from fps loss. The truth is if you have a crappy computer and try running it on high graphics it will look like crap. If you have a decent computer it will run better. There's no denying that. I have an HP G6 N7 edition laptop. It's customized with a Quad core processor and 8 gigs of ram. Strangely, it seems to work just fine for me. Good graphics, no freezing, no blurring... Looks and runs great. I won't lie and say the end of the story line doesn't leave something to be desired, but that's what happens when they set things up for a sequel."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice, I like it so far, love the Guard Dog thing...really cool"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WHY NOT??? ITS FUN AS F**K!!! GO GET IT AND SET IT TO YOUR PREFRENCE!!! :D GO NOW!!!! *AHEM *AHEM steam sales
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so awsome game only think is that is to pity the has and part 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have problems that i cant open my multiplayer but game is awsome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sick visuals, smooth gameplay....pure COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice story !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best campaign and really nice new mode cranked and blitz.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Rgis game is byfar the best Call of duty out there. totally buy it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would love to play this game but I have uninstalled because of the lag :(((((  does anyone know if the lag has been fix?!?!?!?!?!?! (let me know plz) 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game have 2 place in cod games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great FPS game, but not as good as Black Ops 2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i do in fact reccomend this game to anyone 9+ years old.the only exceptions are that this game was ment to run on next-gen consoles,that means u need a more powerful computer rig to be able to play without lag. other than that its fun and the community is very nice"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just want to say that I have played most, if not all COD games ever released since Call Of Duty 1 and I enjoy the fast paced competitiveness of the multiplayer. With that being said, I was very hesitant to buy this game after playing the abomination called, MW3, which is in my opinion, the worst COD game ever made, perhaps the worst fps ever made. Cod ghosts is leaps and bounds far superior to Mw3; better guns, maps, sound design, less lag compensation etc.... My biggest issue with ghosts on the pc is the limited FOV, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor visibility, and how quickly I get killed, feels like I die in two shots. Also, the maps with a few exceptions are pretty bad with a lot of camping spots. This game is not even close to being as bad as most people claim, especially from the pc community. It has some major issues as I stated earlier, but it's still a fun game, reminds me of mw2, which is my favorite in the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call Of Duty has been the jewel in the crown for Infinity Ward and Activision for over a decade with no signs of the franchise taking a back seat just yet. However Call Of Duty Ghosts did upset a lot of hard core COD gamers with the introduction of Riley the German Shepard. Although in the modern day of warfare dogs play a major part in the field and although this really *****d o** a lot of games but as you played the game you actually got used to Riley being at your side.  The dog cam was another aspect of the game which annoyed gamers. I liked the dog cam I thought it was really good. great for taking down baddies. On the whole the game is great, I found the start of the game a bit on the weird side, but once you get past this it flies through and youâ€™re thrashing your way through the levels. The level with the sharks was a real pain in the backside and I hated it because I kept dying all the time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you didnt get the season pass, your going to have a bad time. $130 dollars just to get every DLC?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Immersive experience that is relentless in it's pace if you allow the story to drive you forward as I have been. Love it, love them all so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Some lag issues. With tweaked settings you can smooth this game up a bit. Clan wars is kinda cool but you have to able to play soft and hardcore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,iyts amazing only thinhg i wish for is survival mode on extinction like on zombies i wish it was there hopefully they add it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game a must buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game. All you gotta do is go to squads and play those and have fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game if they would just get rid of the laggg!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game made me sad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game the best of all call of duty love it ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so good good game i recomend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,you can send riley to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them up :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a fun game but an insult to preveise Cod games 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How does one download the ripper!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best COD i have ever played keep it up people!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the game alot since I am a COD fanboy xD here are the pros and cons Pros -Really intretaining multiplayer experience -You can play for hours and hours -Decent single player campaign  -OK graphics  Cons -Horrible maps with alot of fogg -Sometimes its really laggy -Not alot of people play the game so it takes forever to find a game -Not alot of maps and very few gamemodes  from 1/10 I would give this game like a 7 and would recommend only poeple who like first persons shooters to buy this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Has a great campaign, the multiplayer however is pretty stale, always the same two maps. And there is almost no online community to try out the new features such as squads, or extinction. Would recommend for a single player fps exerience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Was a mediocre CoD game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game rocks!!!...Bigfoot is real...RRRR
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a nice game and in my shop it cost 35 euro
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know why people give this game so much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's call of duty so you know what kind of experience you're looking for, it has controller support, I've had no technical issues whatsoever, and the storyline is exactly what you'd expect from any cod game. For people with a crashing problem, I think its time for an updated graphics card or just a new pc all together."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Situation 1 Go to multiplayer TDM at peak time -&gt; It says 'Player Online: 1116', 'Players in Playlists: 238' -&gt; Join -&gt; 'No Game Found'.   Situation 2 Go to multiplayer TDM at peak time -&gt; Luckily join game -&gt; Start -&gt; Lags -&gt; 'Call Of Duty Ghosts has stopped working...'  Situation 3 Go to Extinction at peak time -&gt; '21 potential game found' -&gt; Never joins."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Modern Warfare set a good standar for the Call of Duty games. Good campaign, special ops and great survival maps. They also featured much humour thanks to the British characters of Price and Soap. Ghosts is a rather quick campaign, set mainly in the U.S. and features some good missions. Sadly, you feel as if you're in a rat-run, even under the ocean or up in space. Georgeous scenery, but one hasn't any time to marvel at it, as you are rushed around. There isn't any humour and it's rather po-faced in places. Maybe Advanced will take up the mantle set by MW's series? Ghosts multiplayer is packed with different things and squads is very entertaining. I'm not sure it's as revolutionary as the makers said it would be. The graphics for me aren't as good in places as Black Ops and it's more of a strain on computers. It seems to be an all or nothing but the makers have included an option for 'dynamic fur'. Having played great games such as Fallout 3 and Fary Cry 3, maybe the way forward for COD is to make the campaign much more wider, have different ways to tackle fights and not have the same AI running in the same places everytime. Still, I do like all the COD games but maybe quality over once a year releases may help?   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Could of been a lot better. Not may people play becasue of preformance issues at launch and Feild of View setting locked. Black Ops II smokes Ghost. You paid for map packs and are unable play becasue the game is dead most of the time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best action game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"even i got gaming pc ( i7 , 780 , 32 gb ram) but multiplayer also can make me hang and dc... pls fix this problem . thx.. ( my other friend also got this problem..)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yea very nice game !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nc weapons and nc skins
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the online play on this game is dreadful, looks ok campain is ok"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The story is ok. but a bit short ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love this game but you may want to 'upgrade' your game box for the best experience. Recommend x64 i7 w/ 8gb ram and a very good Vid card.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i dont know why people dont like it, sure it is pretty much no different then the other cods, but it plays well i rarely lag no fps drops, the maps are pretty cool, the guns are balanced except for the ripper. the campaign is fun in the beggining but drops off at the end. the reason people didnt like this game is cause they only play cod, they need to move on to other stuff, take a break from it like i did. now that i have come back to it i really started to enjoy it again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can't even play 11/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awsome game. A must have if you like first person shooter games.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun and fast shooter game require some skill. lot of cheaters but we will prevail !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Meh, it does things. And you get to shoot stuff. Wait for a sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game. Will buy on xBox one too :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Im glad that Call of Duty finally added a 6 player coop against AI..with friends now they need to lets us med each other like the Zombie versions.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Actually a GOOD Call of Duty game! :) Ghosts ftw!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Similiar to the previos version, howver with newer features, such as space fighting, tank warefare, and a dog. Overall it is as i expected from the Call of Duty series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,After skipping most previous CoD's I loved this one especially when played in NVidia Surround
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Was an ok 4h, (once you'd fixed the low res textures), but christ are these getting more and more daft."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To all those who complains in this AWESOME game!!!  I have a tip for you.... upgrade your PC!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Definitely not worth Â£40, but I like shooting people and this is the game to do it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Steam Connect Faild. :S
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First of all I want to thank the awesome game devs for making this so damn good.   I must address the negative comments that some losers make against the cod series. I just want to take a moment to tell you all the 'SUC IT'.  This COD pulls you into the action and the action os so smooth, that you forget you are not  actually there. It's nothing short of magic.   I've played FPS for a along time and nothing is as smooth and rewarding to play as this. Yes, I have BF4 also, and it's Great also.  5 Stars to the max for this COD Ghosts... "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is beautiful and is definently the best call of duty yet. They added so many little details like soldier customazation and particles, awesome perks (they are finnaly useful) and upgrading attachments with squad points is fun and easy the only bad thing is poor optimization they added many many more details :D 9.5 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an utter disaster. For a PC game, graphical quality is blatantly dumbed down unless you set all settings to extra. Even the 'High' settings seem more like a low to medium quality for most games. This cuts a large crowd of players out of the mix and the poor port runs terribly on PC. Frame stutters are constantly happening, even on my high end rig (which runs Battlefield 4 in full quality without a hiccup). Gameplay is a joke, and there are more issues than anything else that prevent an enjoyable experience. I was lucky enough to find this game brand new at Best Buy for $30, and I must admit that this price is STILL too high for such a piece of crap. I do not compare this title to other Call of Duty titles, unlike others, since I believe each game represents it's own flavor. I am a fair reviewer, and I must say that this game is dead. You are lucky enough to find 5,000 players on simultaneously, and this number decreases everyday.  I guarantee this will be a waste of your money, so keep it for those better titles that are available."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is great Steam fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to many Hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,looks awsome...but...you really do need the minimum ram or it's lag city almost unplayable on 2g ram.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice and slow!! He he.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its far better than most say good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wicked game. Buy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it does not let me run the game but when i downloaded them both multiplayer and single player it let me run it once now it dosent let me run it at all so its a comlete waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphics are good, SP was good but not as good as COD MW3. MP in COD Ghost is great. It needs dedicated servers though if Infinity Ward wants to thrive as the best MP military FPS. I didn't regret buying COD Ghost. A lot of COD haters out there so beware of gang warefare reviews. I like BF4 presently but hated BF3 like it was a plague to MP military FPS due to its hacking loopholes. COD Ghost has not manifested any of those issues without reprecussions. Get COD Ghost on sale and I believe you will be a happy camper, sniper, knifer, etc"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Occasional glitches are unexpected and sully but do not break an otherwise AAA spectacle. Definitely expect games this big to cross every T and dot every I, but it does not. No excuse. That said, the game is a good time start to finish. Perhaps the most fun COD, though also by far the easiest. Good graphical and sound improvements. Played the campaign start to finish on hardened in under 8 hrs, exact time Im not sure. That said, I did not find all the hidden objectives, so there is some reason to do it again. Of course, multiplayer awaits."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Still beter than COD. Oh wait.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I personally really liked this game. Its not as good as the previous Cods but thats why you buy it on sale like i did.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's ok
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For 15 euros it's a great game! I've only played the first 2 missions of the Campain, and it's really good for a COD game. The graphics don't look anywhere close to DX11 games like Battlefield 4 but they are quite good for that kind of game. I liked the story and I will contiue playing the Campain. The Multiplayer is just like any other COD. Generaly its an fast paced Arcade shooting game with perks, levels and unlocks, just like all the previous CODs. Only bad thing is that there are no dedicated servers, there's a machmaking system like in Black Ops 2, MW2, MW3 and Advanced Warfare. If you are a fan of the series you will like this too, it's a fun game. If you're looking for a more serius combat game for online, look at Battlefield 3 and 4, Insurgency, and Rising Storm.  As for the Performance. The game is quite light, i get 80+ fps on my PC (i5, GTX770) at 2560x1440 resolution on Maximun possible settings with FXAA.  It runs much better on Windowed (no border) mode, insteed of Full screen. Try that!  Low quality textures FIX:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/209160/discussions/0/648813728475064586/ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really fun!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I prefer this to Black ops 2 but it is easier to join an online game on Black ops
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yeh. 9/11 would buy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,need more playerssssssssssssssssssss
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game ever! If you want a really crappy game this is the one for you!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is one of the best COD and multiplayer is different but good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE END IS SO DISAPOINTING THERE NEEDS TO BE A SECOUND CODG 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,People just need to stop hating on this game the story is great and the gameplay even better runs great on my lenovo y510p all high settings and the online is fun so unless your a total noob who can't appreciate a good quality game or your computer just sucks horribly don't buy it other than that i highly recommend it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, loved the storey line"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD RULES! Its gripping story lines &amp; expansive strategic play makes this one of, if not THEE, best shooter multiplayer games around! Long may it continue! HOO RAH!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,googd game but needs more levels and it needs less compication but ist a good but VERY SHOT GAME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a great, action packed game. Ilke the other CoDs, it is fun and exiting, I reccomend it to everyone."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Buy it u won't regret (unless you don't look up how to make it less laggy/btr grphics) but it is fun : )
Call of Duty: Ghosts,you will not go wrong buying this game multi platform
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghost is an awesome game. The players can be shady at times. Overall the game is tops!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I can see this is going to be a great game however I have been having a glitch with my Graphics Card so it hangs right after the initial video sequence. I can't recommend it yet but stay tuned :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is good as usual, but after more than 1300 hours in ArmA 2 and 3 the CoD looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I would recommend to buy the CoD Ghosts anyway :)  Multiplayer is awful, even CoD BO II was better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will write a review when I can actually play the game... PC version crashes constantly, and so far is a complete waste of money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fast pace. Excellent graphics. Missions in unusual sites such as underwater. Fight from Helo's, Tanks, Cars and even in the ISS in space. No hang ups nor freezes. A plus for COD fans and everyone who enjoys first person shooters. Will play multiplayer once I finish Single player."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,+Good game +Good graphics (if you stop jumping into the game without bloody setting them up) +Extinction mode +Squads +Awsome singleplayer +I dont have processer and game still works good (only loading screens take a bit but that could be default)  -High system requirements -Some times some fps drops (but there patching alot of stuff)  Over all i love this game 8.5/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,my call of duty ghost dosent work wich sucks 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OMG its My Life&lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a really good game and I don't see why it has so much hate
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like shooting dudes in the near future, this is for you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game i recommend it to everyone, story was fine sam as graphics"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, better then some of its priors"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome Game, Love it. Alot of complaining by some, but had some issues at first, but worked out now and having fun. As far as Steam goes only thing I can say is your Awesome! Awesome graphics, sound and frame rates! Think I'll stick with steam, problems are minor and Steam always come through for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"for the most part this is a good single player action genre. There are quite a few bugs like freezing in the middle of game play that becomes anoying at best but for the most part it was fun to play and am going to take it to another level again. There ia a patch that fixes the freezing effect. Have fun with the game, may finally try a multilayer game soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best DLC For COD Yet, Nice Graphics, Good Gameplay, Lots Of Things To Do. 88/100"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the best game that has the longest campain i have ever played. Overall i am very satisfied with what i bought.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, just need more players in the community"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Games fun one of the first games i bought when i built my computer i expected to be more players but i guess people on pc dont like CoD. The only problem i have is some lag in the game i think they giving up on the pc servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghost is a really good game. There was work put into the graphics and the into the developing of the story, of this game. I LOVE the ending of the game. There are onely two problems that I have 1: on the mission 'no mans land' you play a bit as your dog, and when I attack some of the enemies with him he just jumps right through them. 2: the game is too short and you get bored of finishing it 20 times. This is still a good game and one I enjoy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I can barely get a game online, and when i eventually do get in a game, it is full of semi â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ people camping like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they are. please fix this because your games are going up the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  thank you going to buy bf4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Speaking from point of some1 who doesn't really like shooters, specially in recent years (grew up on quake and similar stuff), i really like this game. I can play it for 1 hour just to take brake, or for whole evening which didn't happen for me since HL1 :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its somthing different! Pritty epic! :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you bought this come with me and lets kill ourselfs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The unicorn camo pack makes it totally worth it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst game i ever bought, waste of money do not buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Overall its still call of duty, but iw had the chanse to create a better cod, but they didnt."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome sim. Game play is perfect for my machine. Running everything at full detail. Wow, what a great job guys. Keep up the good work :-)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is AMAZING!!! u guys should seriously play this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"NOTE: Only Single player game time recorded by Steam. I played only MP, thats why I have 0.1 game time  Best Multiplayer experience in my opinion. No heavy lags, no sudden disconnections and I didnt even see any hackers. to be honest I was expected more deep character customization, but this still works for me. I also like female characters.  I didnt bother single player since its not really interesting.  And I'm not going to buy Advanced Crapfare.  8,9/10 Close to Amazing"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wasn't sure what to expect, since the Call of Duty series has been such a polarizing IP, often described as representing the worst of modern gaming: superficial yearly updates, lots of locked DLC content, nickel and diming you to get new vanity items, etc. I also hadn't played a COD game in about 5 years, so I was a bit hesitant when I picked this up. Fed up with EA and their Origin software, the fact that COD doesn't force you to use a propietary DRM tool is a huge plus. The single player campaign was fun, while short as some have noted. The action is fast paced, though sometimes it does feel way too 'on-rails.'   Graphically this game is quite nice, and the levels can be quite atmospheric. I play on 'ultra' settings, and there are some very beautiful set pieces during the single player campaign. This isn't a graphical revolution like Crysis was back in the day, but it's a good looking game if you have the hardware. I only recently got this game, though, so I didn't experience any of the pre-patch problems people complain about. It's been very reliable.  The multiplayer is what most people play, and I was very happy to see the addition of the Squads feature, which is perfect for a casual player like myself. Basically, by using bots to fill in your squad, it allows you to have an online or offline experience that feels like playing against all human opponents. Regular multiplayer is decent, though as always it's a crapshoot as to how good/idiotic/rude your fellow gamers will be. The game modes are fun (love kill confirmed), and the ability to build up your stats/guns/gear etc is pretty much par for the course, and the gun selection is pretty good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not as bad as I thought. To me, all the COD:MW's feel different. This one, lag aside, really isn't that bad. If you're in Australia, MW3 games pop more often and have better latency. That said, I've only about 15 hours on it.  Haven't touched the single player yet. So, for that? I dunno.  Honestly, with all the bad press I see, I thought it'd be far worse. If it's on sale, I say get it. Then add on the DLC packs if you find you like it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hack lobby site pls 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,multiplayer game constantly lag.This is happening from the first day when i started to play.sometimes is unplayable.I notice that si happening to other players too.And this is not related with computer capability
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Id like to say this game is oe of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ist games my dad has purchesed for me. Because i am un able to play it because it freezes after the game starts in launch. I have the right specs to and mw2 mw3 mw4 works just fine, it funnny though how many people have problems with this game and it just seems as a money buyer because they are not doinh jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to fixing it so more people can play. last time i checked there is 1,000 people online in game thats pretty sad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy ghosts, If you already bought, u r fu**ed up. Imagine you could have bought some cigars and couple of beers and enjoyed all night watching TV. This is better than that. I'm a f**ed up S. Korean user. If I turn on the FOV changer, Steam already knows it. and just kick my as* out. Just adjust your FOV. and erase the programm. It will work. They just think about money.Not you. I have alrealy purchased digital hardened edition. But I can't play it. They r real cheaters.  They make me steamed a lot. Steam shoud get steam a lot. I' m already digitally spanked hard a lot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's like any other Call of Duty, and if those weren't for you, then this probably isn't either. That said, I enyoyed the campaign, the updated graphics and especially your buddy and helper Riley the dog. Even though the multiplayer is lackluster and fails to bring anything improved to the table.   All-in-all the campaign gets a big thumbs up from me for the 'on-rails' experience, but the multiplayer is as boring and bland as ever. It's not worth the pricetag so buy it when it gets on sale, like myself. - And if you plan on getting the Season Pass, you might aswell get the Hardened Edition - You get the Season Pass w/ multiplayer items, if you like that sort of thing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Go ahead, waste your money. They just made a Battlefield game with crap graphics and IWNET trash multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of my favorite storylines in a CoD game aside from the fact that the 2 main characters and antagonist are practically terminators.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its hard to get a game with out lag and thats with my 100 mb down load
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing COD game on PC I have played on in a while. Feels good getting back into COD. Lol jokes. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that.. Average game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing multiplayer! For now on I am getting any up coming Call of Dutys like Advanced Warfare. Might have a little bad graphics in Ghost but overall it will be worth buying because of the multiplayer! So many weapons and gear to choose from after you complete the challenges. This is a amazing game and you should buy it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Edit: Finally, the bug was about crashing with current nvidia driver. Downgrading it helped me able to play them.  When it comes to story, it is the second best of cod series. I hope they fix the problem soon or i wont buy any cod series. Looking forward to play Ghosts 2 if there will be one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yeah its fun. Better than Black Ops. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Most amazing game ever, my favorite part is the part where I deleted it and got 26 gigabytes back 10/10 would delete again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Is It!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,unable to play on line wasted money on this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"no different than any other call of duty made. but, like every other call of duty, still has fun gameplay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,  Amazing and Intresting Storyline! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far, it's good! but i prefer Multiplayer (since this is first CoD game that i bought it.not cracked :v ) But, in single, i prefer on the previous one. Not that bad but not that good. And careful, they migh crash sometimes. Not friendly to mid-spec. Actually, i got depressed...Why i bought this game? xD so..... this game is actually worth to try, atleast just wait for another discount xD or......dont buy this game. Not good for health"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you've played any of the call of duty games then this game won't seem like anything new...However, if you enjoy playing the cod series then you will like it...Great weapons. Could be a bit better optimized for PC but still delivers the goods.. Found this game to be much more enjoyable with a lobby of good friend/players...Be careful though..A few 'hacked lobbies' have created false VAC bans on some players that do not cheat and Activision and infinity ward won't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it, or state why, or give proof of the infraction. Although I know many have cheated and been caught, which we do applaud, some players have been thrown in hacked lobbies and paid the price later with a Ban..beware.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the part where i uninstall the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I loved this game, bought it mostley for the campain and the gun game whenever i decied to get online But i would recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well its great you know when i go to play extiction (what i bought the game for) it crashes great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Guys, go buy it and we can play together like HELL YEAH!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS A GOOOOOD GAME!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the only CoD game I have, and I loved the campaign from the immersive storytelling to the realistic graphics, great mechanics, and overall fun experience. I wish I could say the same about multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would both recommend this game and not recommend it at the same time. If you have a good enough PC with at least 8gb/ 16gb and a pretty good graphics card you are good to go really with still some lag/ fps drops. But if you don't have the best computer you will really struggle to play it. Overall I would recommend it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't play multiplayer so this review has nothing to do with anything multiplayer, only campaign.   I'm happy with the game, I got it on clearance at Walmart for 10$ and once installed it is now in my Steam library so that was pretty sweet. After seeing so many bad reviews I felt compelled to write this.   The Good:  I've liked every COD since the very first one. All of them. I'm not super fanboy here and only like COD, I don't like multiplayer anything, and it is not because of screaming 12 year olds that just learned how to say their first curse word, it is just that I only like multiplayer with people on split screen in my living room. I used to system link while deployed and that was a lot of fun with COD MW3 when it first came out.   Ghosts graphics are fine in my opinion. I'm a humble gamer, I run an AMD A8-6500 with a Geforce 750 ti and I get over 40fps in all situations which is acceptable to me on normal/medium graphics settings. I don't need 60fps for campaign enjoyment.   Gameplay wise everything feels the same as any other COD title. Nothing is unfamiliar, everything feels tight and typical COD. Good controller support for my Xbox 360 controller.   Plot and story wise it is typical over the top COD. While not as enthralling as the original modern warfare 1 and 2, it is entertaining and kept me going.   The bad:   I was upset when MW3 ditched zombies. I always felt zombies would of made a great standalone if they made it along the lines of LFD, I would of bought it if they did. Ghosts has alien hunting that is boring to me without others to play with. I don't do multiplayer so I can't say how it is online.   The price is what turned me away from the game for so long. I would get this game if it is on sale, or like I acquired it on clearance. I don't think the game is worth 20$, it feels like a 10$ game. I don't feel ripped off for 10$ but 20$ I'd be a little resentful.   I've only played for an hour as of writing this. Once I complete the campaign I'll see if I find anything to gripe about and will update."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player wasn't bad but not very good either, but Multiplayer is pretty fun but the only downside is that the maps are soooooo HUGE that it can take a couple of minutes to find someone. Not bad but you should buy this when it gets cheaper or save your money so you don't kill your computer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game Is AWESOME I Would Recommend it 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game. love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think this game plays fine and my computer is really old and i have no problems with fps or stutter blah blah blah.....so on and so forth.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i loce this game i find it more fun than any cod i've played before hand
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Beware of Graphic let downs, funny unrealistic campaign scences, but same as all COD's Adictive..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game work fine on 4 GB ram i love this my friend share it to me will buy it for 60$ 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just bought this game and it is not working i have a i7 920 and a nvidia 750 ti with 12gb of ram and it just wont run properly it starts up but all im getting is a laggy flickering screen
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well yeah i do like the game now i can play it. I had a ATI Radeon 6870 1GB that should more than handle the game.  But after six months of freezing and me pulling out my hair. A great mate of mine brought me THe Radeon R9 280X for my 40th and now i have had not one problem the game is so smooth and has not crashed once.  Was it worth the wait Yes and No i love that i can play the game now but feel a little cheated as the game is old now and not shiny and new.  But in saying that i will keep on playing untill the next one comes out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game. Will buy on xBox one too :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not as great as all the other call of duty games but still worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is a great game but activision could have worked on the graphics for the maps
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"really liked this game, so much better then BF4, consistant connections and stable internet, great game overall, give it 8 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun game, but to much campers :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its an alright COD, I like it plays with no lag downside is that there are many hackers that just like to show off. Extinction is awesome and funy pass time when you get angered by hackers. All in all good game, but wait till it goes on a sale. Thats when this games worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"On the campaing i expected more from Infinity ward, but it was good, points 1-6 * I give Cod Ghost Story point 4. Multiplayer is VERY good .. Points 6  All the other modes are interresting, have not tried the out properly yet .. but so far so good!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's not actually that bad, the weapons are all pretty balanced and the maps are decent"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like the game but it is so laggy any tips to change thst
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pretty good in my book
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its ok but nearly 75% are camping in corners or are going to prone to shoot. If u like this &lt;---- its the right game for u!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game.If you love Call of Duty you will like it. Definetly worth of buying.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"although i can't get into a game right now because everybody left to play titanfall or black ops 2 ... i still had fun playing it while i could get into a game... darn shame this is a ghost town now. although i had MAJOR lag due to low fps (it was probably 1 fps on THE LOWEST settings for a bit.) its going to be so funny when i see people praising this game as like the best call of duty ever and complaining about how adavanced warfare is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... it just saddens me that people dont play on the pc as much as consoles because the xbox has at least 300,000 people on ghosts. and on pc there are less than 1,000 or just over 1,000 on ghosts..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why dont they make some nice larger maps for sniping on. all round goos game since I have up date my machine the graphics are out standing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes it is a fun game if you don't encounter hackers. Although sometimes you die and its kinda unfair , this game is a fun action packed game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too many hackers in this game ! needs dedicated servers to be able to control some of this !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's a awesome game, play it everday insce i bought it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This FPS game is awesome instead of zombies from the earlier frachise it has ALIENS!!! And its freacking awesome...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it was ok , but not great. from 1 to 10 i give it a 5, if your a fan , i say buy it....."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"slow to get started,with technical issues etc,crashing,not enough ram!but once it game not bad. Multi player still to crack wide open but getting there, rate game 3 stars***"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like call of duty: ghosts but you creators really messed up zombies mode. Next time you make a call of duty put more than just campaign and some thing else make them all the ones you alredy have made. That way zombie lovers AND alien lovers get the 'best of both worlds.'   - the forgoten soldier
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Suprisingly fun game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Actually a GOOD Call of Duty game! :) Ghosts ftw!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best CoD ever, i don't recomend it for wooden PCs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a really good game and I don't see why it has so much hate
Call of Duty: Ghosts,my call of duty ghost dosent work wich sucks 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know what people are complaining about, unless they have crappy setups. I'm running at highest framerates and settings on my MSI GP60 and never experience drops, freezes, or anything else these flamers are complaining about. It's a solid game. I'm not much for MP, but I'm finding I like playing it on Ghosts. I do miss the SpecOps feature of MW3, but it's still a lot of fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome Game, Love it. Alot of complaining by some, but had some issues at first, but worked out now and having fun. As far as Steam goes only thing I can say is your Awesome! Awesome graphics, sound and frame rates! Think I'll stick with steam, problems are minor and Steam always come through for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"campers, campers everywhere  10/10 would buy an RV"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LIKE IT ALOT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty cool game. Limited in it's scope, not much room to move around and the spawn points are easy to camp. If you're looking for fast resets and quick games this is it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game but rly bad engine
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game play now that they've added the FOV slider. Love the weapons and diversity of the maps. Private matches against the bots are also a bonus as they provide a way to test out the weapons and their characteristics. Two thumbs up!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a fun game but an insult to preveise Cod games 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How does one download the ripper!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best COD i have ever played keep it up people!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great story
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's okey
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love this game, was very iffy about the purchase due to the negativity, but i finally gave in and grabbed it at best buy for 30$. I must say the campaign was amazing, awesome graphics, easy to follow story line, and solid gameplay. The campaign alone made the purchase worth it, and now of course there is multiplayer. It feels just like all the other Cod multiplayers in terms of gameplay, but the graphics are of course better and newer smaller additions.   I came from play CoD4 from the last 4 years to this one, so to me this game is amazing and i have no hostility to the franchise (both are amazing games)  P.S. before you buy it, make sure you have a computer that can run this, i run it at 1440p at 53fps with no tearing, so not sure where these other people are getting their issues besides having a ancient computer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the campaign is awesome 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Cod EVER!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,riperr can i buy it free 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too bad the update download packs are not placed here all at once... I downloaded once and now there are a dozen different upgrades available ... oh well already paid my money.... not paying anymore.  Why is the server off line so much.... gone back to play cod 4  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't recommend this game at this time, due to the fact that during my initial 2.1 hours of play the game crashed twice and I have yet to attempt to play it again. So, at this point I am disappointed in such highly touted game being so buggy. I really had high hopes for this title."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love the game ..........  But the story mode is realy bad ...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why i cant open multiplayer? its just open launch multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is what it is.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I just need a weapon
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not as good as i thought but for cod i am a big fan keep them coming
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not as good as Modern Warfare 2 but worth playing. Shame so few in the playlists
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game , '' got me ''."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a realy good game but better anticheat shuld make it better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Much better multi-player experience than COD AW. Still plenty of people online as of July 2015.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awsome Game... I love it! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its pretty amazing...bcs it is better than the newer cod like black ops 2 if your not into high tech stuff..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's alright, i guess, 5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Interesting to come back to after some years. graphics are good even on the low settings smooth game play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not better than black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW  It's a pretty good game that goes along the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' principle so the core gameplay elements are the same as the other titles of the franchise. The story is interesting, like a blend of the Modern Warfare and Black Ops storylines put together to make a large scale war cross with revenge and brainwashing. As usual the campaign is pretty short but worth the playtrhough along with decent achievements. 7//10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is ok but the lack of dedicated servers lets it down alot
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game Just Has Quite A Lot Of Hackers That Annoy Me!! :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is a big ball of garbage, brainless run and gun. If there was anything good at all in the last CODs, now it's totally gone.  Campaign is soulless, totally out of date for a triple A 2013 game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,recomendation---&gt;don't buy this crap game anymore
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game just to many cheats on mulitiplayer something has to be done about them thay spoil the game for everyone that dont cheat
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I install COD: Ghosts, and its not start. What shall i do people?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought this game 4 months ago and still wont play what a waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Activision has to find a way to secure the system from hackers for cheaters Punkbuster worked very well on the early call of duty series, If a chearter was found they kicked them for a few minutes if they kept cheating they were bounced for life, It worked well, Why don't they have it for Ghosts??"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"GOOD MAPS, TACTICAL PLAY."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game 3/5 but too expensive
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty aids mp but the campaign was well worth it dont spend anymore than 10bucks on this cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love call of duty ghosts, It is really fun and easy to pick up. Super fun IGN would rate :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All the comments are bad,don't know why.  1. Campaign was the best campaign I have played so far in cod. You get to fight in space, water, and other environments never presented in the history of call of duty.  2. Multiplayer is the best I have played so far. Love how you get to customize your own character and squad. The squads mode allows you to play against ai controlled soldiers and you are still able to rank up and customize your loadouts.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Stop it all you haters. I see so many bad reviews on this game, and so many of them say things like 'same old game re-hashed'.  Well, just how many things can you do in a FPS? The Ghosts campaign takes you underwater to fight sharks, in space, in cities, in the countryside, etc. Just how many localities are there anyway?  Here is my take on the game:  Campaign is about what I expected. Yeah it's cut and paste, but like I said, there are only so many things you can do in a FPS campaign. I enjoyed it for what it is to me - a small part of a game that I really bought for multiplayer.  The game does have 2 major flaws, no dedicated servers and poor optimization. I have a good computer, so the second is not a problem. So my only beef is the no dedicated server part.  I have several hundred hours in the game, and look forward to playing it. Here is my recipe for enjoying the game:  I have 3 friends that play this game. We hook up every Friday night and skype each other. Then one of us creates a game, and the others join. Sometimes we fight each other, some times we team up and fight bots. The other night, we played a game of domination (3 of us that night) against, I think, 15 or so bots on hard. Now that's a tough game. Search and destroy against a bunch of bots, or maybe one of us and some bots (we bid on the number) against the rest of us. Sometimes we do knife only fights, or one of us will camp, while the others try to dig him out. I could go on, but you can see the possibilites are almost endless.  We have a ton of fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lame, way over the top storyline and unlikeable characters, plus a few pc optimisation issues (you'll need a decent PC and card), but still some moments of awesomeness in this decent FPS. The parts of this game on the space station were very new and interesting. Overall, worth a sale buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same as previovs version of dis franchise  Bvt vvith different stories,are served vvith epicness like vvatching an action movie  BVT !!  In mvltiplayer mode yov can add BOTS (Friend n Enemy)  Yov can set their diffiKVLTies too ,jvst like in covnter strike series  RARELY NEXT-GEN FPS GAME,have dis featvre :D  So If Yov seek OFFLINE MVLTIPLAYER,i very2 reccomend yov take dis :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't know why people don't like the game, I love the game but very hard."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun while it lasted. The lack of players made multiplayer useless. Overall it was a good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks would not recomending u bguys buying this the spawn sucks die way to fast on regular mode and not to many wepon choices
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Finally playable
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME &lt;3 MY FAVOURITE! BEST COD I'VE EVER PLAYED !!! 11/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a good game :) It's worth about 6 euros i think not 30 euros... 10/7 ;) awesome multiplayer but bad campaign :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BEst recent Hardcore Multiplayer (including Advanced Warfare and Black ops 3)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,They must fix lag performance
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game.  Weird random lag spikes though :/  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game but not for noobs!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITs a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how can i download the festive DLC?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-Overall I like it.  -Typical COD campaign with not a lot of changes.  -Multiplayer has a bit to live up to, I am loving the new perk system, loadout system and map dynamics. Textures are sometimes poor but you don't really notice in the heat of battle. A bit of lag but i's not as bad as people say, takes time to get used to the slightly slower gameplay. -Extinction is good fun but zombies is better. Although it is a lot faster and has what would be killstreaks in multiplayer as buyable perks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a great game but too many hackers but overall its best for the pc and its a lot of fun to play with friends
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game has been improved since my last review it has stopped crashing and aand stopped stutering in the menu
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yes love Ghosts &amp; Extinction.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is nice  but he crachet on federation level can i fix that?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,They optimized the game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hacks galore!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are keen on a specific type of gameplay, even 12-20 player infantry-focused competitve FPS, I am not sure Ghosts is the best choice. It is, however, a well-rounded package for the casual FPS player. There are four main game modes; their specific details can be found on Wikia and elsewhere, so I'll only share my impressions.  Campaign: mediocre  It's also short, only around 5 hours on Regular difficulty. Ironically this works to the game's favor because it doesn't drag. When I think of Black Ops, I think of 'Step One...!' When I think of CoD 4, I think of Prypiat and 'Crew Expendable.' There is no Reznov or Price in Ghosts. It's just a group of forgettable characters on a conventional military quest against a bad guy I fought pathetic. Even the few references to other media aren't done that well. On the other hand, in that short 5 hours, you get to play missions from under the sea to outside the atmosphere. You get to drive a tank like a bumper car and pilot a chopper like an arcade game. Most missions feel like deja vu if you've played MW or Black Ops before, and the few novel ones don't stand out. If the campaign were 10 hour and I had to play each type of mission twice as much, I'd probably complain. Fortunately, the 5 hours are a rush, even if a forgettable one.  Actually I do have one complaint about the campaign. The mission briefings are narrated like a story. Terrible choice for a video game, where if something is not experienced, it should at least be like a movie. Then again, all that has been done by other CoD games.  Multiplayer: I think it stays true to CoD, but I know little about that.  Unlockable weapons/equipment, perks, kill streaks, operations (challenges) are all present. There are plenty of better reviews on how the multiplayer stack up against other CoD and non-CoD games.  For a casual gamer new to CoD, the best I can say is that CoD multiplayer is kinda like CS, but fancier. For the same casual players, Private Match is a godsend. You can set up a Private Match to play with friends (or just by yourself); you have instant access to all weapons/perks/kill streaks/maps/most if not all game modes + full bot support. If you don't care to go through persistent growth experience, Ghosts remains perfectly playable. The only downside is you can't just open your game for any stranger to find and join.  Squads: The opposite of Private Match  If you instead want to experience the persistent growth of competitive multiplayer without the actual competition, Squads mode is for you. Here is a collection of 4 game modes focused on AI, co-op, and 1-on-1 competition. The popular Survival mode from MW3 makes a return, with 4 instead of 2 max players now. There is, however, no objective based Spec Ops missions. Unlike Private Match, Squads mode has match making to help you join up with strangers. Squads is the opposite of Multiplayer and is made possible by the game's AI, which is better than any other AI of this type that I've seen.  Extinction: Ah, I actually don't like it that much.  It's the equivalent of Zombies from Black Ops with aliens instead. I can't think of another analogy so just go watch a gameplay video. My problem with Extinction is that it's both short and objective based, thus reducing its replayability compared to other co-op modes in Ghosts. You have a separate progression track specific to this mode, and you can always try different play styles. But for me, if I can complete the mission with one setup, I don't see why i should bother with another. I also find the aliens lame compared to zombies. That's just me; many critics like this mode.  Performance:  There is no shortage of complaints against Ghosts' performance on the PC, especially for multiplayer. They are legit. In its defense though, I am able to play Ghosts on a system below its minimum requirement (Core Duo Quad 3.0, 4GB RAM, HD 4770 1GB) pretty smoothly. In single player, I could set most video options to normal, with a few high and few low and still play at a decent frame rate most of the time (below 60 for sure but I haven't checked fps). With most settings tuned to low, I can also play co-op and Extinction with the only serious slowdowns occuring at the beginning of a match and, surprisingly, at the menu screen both post-match and each time I start Ghost Multiplayer. If you have a good system, Ghost may not live up to your expectations, but if you have a crappy one, you may still be able to play, at least non-competitively.  Bottomline:  Ghosts is like one of the starter weapons in its multiplayer. It has a good collection of decent game modes. If you want a FPS with variety that you can enjoy casually, Ghosts is for you; it's perhaps better at this than any other FPS game out there. If you are a conniseur, every one of those modes may fall short. If you are a conniseur, this review isn't for you. If someday you evolve from casual to a specific taste, you can always get a more appropriate game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just anuther cod nothing new
Call of Duty: Ghosts,gud ratosportugas clan  clan wars
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If ya are gonna put tall buildings in a game have a way to get to the top. Towers , some trees . Give us snipers somewhere to hide and snipe from . you give us sniper rifles but no real good hiding spots'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, loved the storey line"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After a bumpy start, as a relative newcomer to FPS the graphical glitches at the beginning didn't bode well, and delayed my progress a bit. as is the way as I got to the last chapter in campaign an update fixed my SLI woes, making multiplayer a viable option. Enjoyed the story, some nice touches, and with graphics fixed it does what you would expect nothing revolutionary, but then what is? On a par with BF4 finally IMAO."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i love this game so much a little lag but fun but really take off the hackers and cheaters thats not fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thad game is only Cool, all haters are stupid -_-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, here we are again: another year, another Call of Duty. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an utter disaster. For a PC game, graphical quality is blatantly dumbed down unless you set all settings to extra. Even the 'High' settings seem more like a low to medium quality for most games. This cuts a large crowd of players out of the mix and the poor port runs terribly on PC. Frame stutters are constantly happening, even on my high end rig (which runs Battlefield 4 in full quality without a hiccup). Gameplay is a joke, and there are more issues than anything else that prevent an enjoyable experience. I was lucky enough to find this game brand new at Best Buy for $30, and I must admit that this price is STILL too high for such a piece of crap. I do not compare this title to other Call of Duty titles, unlike others, since I believe each game represents it's own flavor. I am a fair reviewer, and I must say that this game is dead. You are lucky enough to find 5,000 players on simultaneously, and this number decreases everyday.  I guarantee this will be a waste of your money, so keep it for those better titles that are available."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is great Steam fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to many Hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphics are good, SP was good but not as good as COD MW3. MP in COD Ghost is great. It needs dedicated servers though if Infinity Ward wants to thrive as the best MP military FPS. I didn't regret buying COD Ghost. A lot of COD haters out there so beware of gang warefare reviews. I like BF4 presently but hated BF3 like it was a plague to MP military FPS due to its hacking loopholes. COD Ghost has not manifested any of those issues without reprecussions. Get COD Ghost on sale and I believe you will be a happy camper, sniper, knifer, etc"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Occasional glitches are unexpected and sully but do not break an otherwise AAA spectacle. Definitely expect games this big to cross every T and dot every I, but it does not. No excuse. That said, the game is a good time start to finish. Perhaps the most fun COD, though also by far the easiest. Good graphical and sound improvements. Played the campaign start to finish on hardened in under 8 hrs, exact time Im not sure. That said, I did not find all the hidden objectives, so there is some reason to do it again. Of course, multiplayer awaits."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so many hacker
Call of Duty: Ghosts,are you making a new call of duty ghost
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is awesome, if you love Millitary games, I highly recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,enjoying the multiplayer. come across a few hackers though which ruins the game play. the campaign side of the game was alot of fun. just a little too short. having said that i found it to be quite involved. over all a fun game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is awsome. The campaign is really nice this time around. In multiplayer, some of its weapons are a bit underpowered but but knifing is amazing. Another thing I hate about multiplayer is its loss of theater mode. Otherwise its really good. I still say get it on sale, but dlc's are a must. Get season pass to get them cheaper."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very story. The color scheme is a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tho. everything is washed grey/brown/blue and looks gross. the settings are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. you cant change your FOV and your FPS are capped on 60 or something and there is no audio settings. the system requirements are stupid. you need 6 gb of ram to play and a GTX 600 and somthing to play without FPS lag. also there is no ping or 4 bars to check your connection so that sucks. also the connection is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ anyway so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. but its COD and my most played game. so yeah
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"People keep saying that 'oh, this game sucks. Don't get it. It's not worth it.' They're wrong. yes there are too many hackers... But there are alot more people who play the game how it should be played."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD RULES! Its gripping story lines &amp; expansive strategic play makes this one of, if not THEE, best shooter multiplayer games around! Long may it continue! HOO RAH!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,googd game but needs more levels and it needs less compication but ist a good but VERY SHOT GAME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a great, action packed game. Ilke the other CoDs, it is fun and exiting, I reccomend it to everyone."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Buy it u won't regret (unless you don't look up how to make it less laggy/btr grphics) but it is fun : )
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great story
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't see what all the fuss is about, yh it may not be a good game as mw and mw2 but it is more fun to play!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A must have!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The worst SP campaign in the series. Had some good set piece moments, and the stupidest ending to any of the series' SP campaigns to date. Did not play the MP portion of the game. 7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i dont know why people dont like it, sure it is pretty much no different then the other cods, but it plays well i rarely lag no fps drops, the maps are pretty cool, the guns are balanced except for the ripper. the campaign is fun in the beggining but drops off at the end. the reason people didnt like this game is cause they only play cod, they need to move on to other stuff, take a break from it like i did. now that i have come back to it i really started to enjoy it again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I know theres been alot of complaints about call of duty not being optimised, But if you have a decent pc up to the specs that is required you will find that all other aspect of this game are amazing, the reason that the specs are so high are because of the design, if you've seen gameplay of it, in 720p it is outstanding, I really am enjoying this game, No over powered guns/killstreaks the internet lag is zero and im on really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ broadband connector, I would recommend this game if you have the specs required so always check first "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst game ever created. only 1000 people online and all of their machines are studdering mess and FPS drops and the makers dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and wont fix it and yet they try to release another addon pack, WTF!! A real shameful expereince this game has created out of the gaming community. A sham of epic proportions. i.e. we got ripped off big time, real big time. I want my money back!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game i recommend it to everyone, story was fine sam as graphics"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, better then some of its priors"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Such a great game !! i LOVE it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game ever! If you want a really crappy game this is the one for you!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is one of the best COD and multiplayer is different but good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on pc right now i would wait because they may or may not be able to fix its issue's.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghost is a really good game. There was work put into the graphics and the into the developing of the story, of this game. I LOVE the ending of the game. There are onely two problems that I have 1: on the mission 'no mans land' you play a bit as your dog, and when I attack some of the enemies with him he just jumps right through them. 2: the game is too short and you get bored of finishing it 20 times. This is still a good game and one I enjoy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, I dont know if Im Happy with this game or not. I will play it, yes, but im confused as to rate it a yes or a no.   Let me be clear on one thing: this game is NOT worth $60  The makers of this game should be confronted about the plot, because its the same thing over and over again. Call of Duty Modern Warefare and Call of Duty Modern Warefare 2 where AMAZING! I loved the pot, even cried at some parts because im a wuss, but Call of Duty Ghosts is throwing in all of this 'You Boys are the only thing I have left in this world' and then theres a cliffhanger ending thats plainly states 'here comes COD Ghosts 2, but not until we finished Advanced Warefare' Not saying that cliffhanger endings are bad, im just saying that to make players wait longer is annoying. they did that to us with Modern Warefare 3, and when we finally got the game, One of the best characters dies, a new one is added in, and your wondering 'Where is this going? are they all gonna die?' I like Call of duty Ghosts and I will play it, but I feel as though it is just a Modern Warefare 3 with a new Paintjob. Im pretty sure im not the only one.  There are good things to this game though, like the multiplayer is really good, but I still have mixed feelings. Idk wether to give this game a thumbs up or down, so im saying netural."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,People just need to stop hating on this game the story is great and the gameplay even better runs great on my lenovo y510p all high settings and the online is fun so unless your a total noob who can't appreciate a good quality game or your computer just sucks horribly don't buy it other than that i highly recommend it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yes love Ghosts &amp; Extinction.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is nice  but he crachet on federation level can i fix that?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty good game only huge maps but the extinction mode is great.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game played them since cod 1 way back awesome still play 1 sometimes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is awesome!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the mapdesign is really bad, just 3 maps are good, i dont care about graphics, some textures are terrible but overall it looks ok, its a classic COD game just the mapdesign was better in the previos games"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THe game is fine if u don't like it don't play it! And it would be nice to respect the developers becouse they worked realy hard on the game and i would want to see u make a bether game!  So deal with it scrub...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a nice game but it's laggin in the menu and it's kinda annoying :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not bad game cod:ghost
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dear cod team hello my name is saman sharifi  (samansharifiasadi@gmail.com).  thank you very much. your shot gun is not real moreover you can work on explosive and ruin too. your geraphic is the best however some sound and video updates are necessary. your zombi map is single and not realised with single player mode another map nevertheless it need some check points. Not only your multiplayer is more important than single player mode  but also a lot of maps are needed (50% of yor maps good as cod black ops 2). good bye.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So far this is the best call of duty I have played and I'm really glad that it was made by infinity ward as modern warfare and modern warfare 2 were really good. I love the new effects, and movement in game like peeping round cover. I also love the campaign and how good it is as I didn't think black ops 2 was that good. I would give this game a 5* and would recommend it to everyone. Ignore what everyone is saying, I havent had any problems running it on my laptop and I can even run it on high. I have not experienced any bugs or framerate drops and would like to say that this game does look nice it just helps if your not running it on the lowest settings, but even then its still just as fun, so go buy it its an amazing game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is broken on so many levels.....campaign...generic as hell. Storyline...? If you say so. Multiplayer.....sigh.....they want to get players 'in the action faster,' so what is their answer to this? Make bigger maps and then just spawn the player right behind the person that just shot them..... You spend so much time being dead it's almost unplayable. If they fix the spawns it might be worthwhile but even then I'm not sure. Everything unlocks with squad points now so there isn't a rank system that you are shooting for to get that next gun since you can save up and buy it in a few rounds of play. Extinction is fun the first few times and if they added some variation to the levels like Left for Dead then it would probably be a better experience. Squads....useless. Again, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over the hardcore multiplayer with a laughably small amount of play modes but the one and only bright side is, in the regular modes, it no longer takes you an entire clip to kill someone as with previous Call of Duties. If you can get this game for well under $30, then sure go for it. $60....don't waste the money. Mabye Infinity Ward will get a clue next time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just finished the single player game. In the PC version, make sure you have a kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ video graphic card. Have a good amount of RAM. After install, run a defrag to get your game files in place. The story line was interesting. If you paid the money, don't complain, just play the game......."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This review is of Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts Single Player...  I never play a single player, but if thats your sort of thing, you may or may not like this one!!  For any more info, please google 'call of duty ghosts single player review'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game once you get used to it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i will hawe this wepond 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not good. Buy black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I enjoyed the campaign, but it took me more than 2 months to get rid of most of the lag. It is very poorly optimized and laggy, and the graphics could be better. It is getting updates which are slowly making it better but I've paid for a GAME not a waist of time! We shouldnt have to put up with it, they are focusing on the console versoion which is making them loose support from me and other PC gamers. I have gotten rid of most lag, except for sniper scope lag, by making it a windowless border, and taking anything that was set to AUTO to somthing else. This game's multiplayer is only fun when your playing with friends because a lot of the people that play are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, a lot of the people not everyone... Anyway I wouldn't buy this game if your computer is OK, only if you have a mid to high end computer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm absolutely sick of the blatant hacking. The rooms are emtying because you can't even enjoy a fair match.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,AWESOME GAME. love the story line. gfx engine was alot like cod4 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love owning these noobs with this game highly recommended it if you don't own it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome game but with the wrong pc it runs slow and acts up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Running game no complaints here! fun single player and full xbox controller support (pc version).. i normally play with keyboards and mice but its nice knowing you can still have a fimiliar control scheme.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Your daily Call of Duty game with graphics that look good... What... It's basically it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i really like this game, i would recommend it, though this is another one of IW ignorant act as of the same thing happened in mw2 when they said we pc users no FoV no rebindable keys basically we pc users were â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ slapped in the face by IW but thank god i didnt buy it on pc got to play it it was nice but the original creators who made cod multiplayer what it is today has moved on to develop a new game TITANFALL i really think its a good game but wtf i have a very good gaming laptop that can run crisis on very high settings idk it cannot run a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphical game like ghosts for some reason BO2 had better graphics but the problem is IW focused on older consoles so the new engine potential really lacked but i will wait for ghosts 2 when IW only focuses on the new gen consoles so we pc users dont have to be hurt or insulted by this again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's ok, campaign is ok multiplayer not bad would reccommend getting whilst on sale though"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is an amazing game so buy it and check it out  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hey guys, I like this game they might even make a movie out og this. the plot the scenario all indicates this might be in the flicks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not perfect but is better than people give it credit for. It is indeed the same old gameplay that we are used to seeing in CoD, and the campaign isn't the best thing I've ever experienced. But in the end the campaign is actually pretty decent as far as multiplayer-based shooters go. And the multiplayer (since the updates) runs well with surprisingly good hit detection. The graphics certainly look dated and the game is not perfectly optimized but I would say if you are a CoD fan, pick it up. If not, move along."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IN ONE WORD TO SUM IT UP! WOW!!!! GET THIS ONE! IT WILL SURPRISE YOU!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game they just need to do something about the hacks before i stop buying the product
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sick visuals, smooth gameplay....pure COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice story !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the best, i cant stop play but they need to fix problems like the problem when enemy shoot you he he need to shoot 3 times to kill you and this is very fast!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Brilliant game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,They must fix lag performance
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game.  Weird random lag spikes though :/  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game but not for noobs!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-Overall I like it.  -Typical COD campaign with not a lot of changes.  -Multiplayer has a bit to live up to, I am loving the new perk system, loadout system and map dynamics. Textures are sometimes poor but you don't really notice in the heat of battle. A bit of lag but i's not as bad as people say, takes time to get used to the slightly slower gameplay. -Extinction is good fun but zombies is better. Although it is a lot faster and has what would be killstreaks in multiplayer as buyable perks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITs a great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how can i download the festive DLC?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game. But they badly need to put dedicated severs. Its about time already.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game but is it any different then the last is it really
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game just needs to use less Ram 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is very good game but there needs to be better controls on Multiplayer cheets. There seems to be a lot of boosting and cheating going on when you play Multiplayers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Greate game of all time. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why it's say that i need to install stem?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love THIS GAME SO MUCH i beat Singleplayer the ending is awesome play it until the end everyone:)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Speaking as a person who doesn't like the Call of Duty franchise I must say, this one is actually quite good! Singleplayer is OK, but Multiplayer has a handful of co-op modes which I'm enjoying greatly. Thumbs up!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game looks nice and gameplay is smooth (dispite the complaints I red, all it takes it a proper system I guess).   This is the first call of duty game I play and I really like the story, so I cant really tell if when you are a loyal CoDer you should buy this game.  60 euro's is too much for a game, but for 30 euro's in my opinion it was already worth the money for this game.   When I tried the multiplayer, Ill make a new post/update this post.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome Game! Definitely Worth IT!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best COD yet, good balance between all weapons :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesomm gameplay , recommended to all MW3 players :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool!~~~
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think COD Ghosts is everything Blops2 was suppose to be. This is by far the best (balanced) COD released other than fixing some of the spawning issues here and there it's a great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont work directX error when i passed the min re
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i've got trouble here. i can't play campaign, always stuck after the earthquake. after first conversation. i'm already uninstall and reinstall again,but still the same"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its not a bad game not the best and its a COD game so didnt expect a huge jump in graphics but my pc handles it well so im happy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"for me, very simlar to MW3, apart of graphics nothing really changed, thats my opinion about multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing game I love It !!!!1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,As usual with this franchise...find the games that aren't infected by a/some skilless trainer user/s and its a very enjoyable game. If they're going to put a reporting fuction in a game they really need to follow up on it...might aswell have a button that says 'click here for $$'...you'd still get the same effect...nothing it seems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome story line with Extinction and squad mode are really good.Multiplayer is also good with its bigger map. But laggy and buggy game at main menu make this game unplayble sometime.If IW fix it and make it as smooth as console then no doubt to say this is best FPS game of 2013.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well despite all the bad reviews i bought this game. i have been playing now for about 5 hours and have not been in any matches with hackers that i can tell and im guessing they fixed all the bugs that people were saying they were encountering because i havent had any problems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yeah ok , Hardcore is alot better than the normal mode."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love the game and so far the hackers have not been a major problem but I can't seem to get my resolution right. The video is grainy. I will keep working on it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A solid CoD game.   Haven't played through the singleplayer as i got bored with it after just a few hours so this is a multiplayer review only.  The maps are varied in size and content from cluttered city streets to more open 'clean' maps. Though it is harder to hold down an aerea or camp out as there are tons of flanking routes all over ( hated this in the beginning, now I've gotten used to it and am starting to like it even!). The game is not as fast paced as Blops2 and you die FAST if shot at with only moderate skills. Because of this i had difficulty playing well in the beginning ( i think the run-and-gun players got the better of me before I was able to anticipate their movements). Revenge-spawning keeps you in the action most of the time to the point that you will spawn in enemy sights too often.  Guns are also varied and feel good to use although tryhards will gravitate to 'that one gun' all the time, wich i find highly irritating (ak-12). It seems the guns are well balanced this time around. Certain classes of gun wil dominate at their aloted range intervals for once.  There is next to no f***ing quickscoping. But noobtubes are back, although not as OP as in MW2...   So is it a good game?   YES - I've soon played 200 hours on this one and I don't plan to stop any time soon!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game. Didn't stray from the aspect and theme of the Call of Duty franchise which made it easy to jump right in and play without having to familiarize myself with it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is a very good GAME !!! MUST BUY!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Activision, InfinityWard really need to try to curb the hacks in this game, fixed the canister throws, and, oh, a few dozen other things. But, the game is least playable for now. ;-/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unless you get the disk and it doesnt install right then your screwed because im having problems with the game and probs launching
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts is a great game but please fix the loading screens they take forever to load I know its not my computer because I can play the game and is fine but when it get to a load screen it takes forever or freezes. GOOD GAME BUT PLEASE PATCH IT. PLEASE FIX THIS DAMN PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME I SPENT 60 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥N DOLLARS OF MY OWN MONEY AND YOU HAVENT FIX THIS GAME. FIX IT NOW ASAP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this if you want to enjoy a multiplayer game without coming across hacker/cheater's regularily.. There seem to be no support on this issue, and cheaters will ruin it for you.. The mutiplayer is fun just like the rest, but impossible to avoid cheaters.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but not as playable as the other IW games....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game. Love the story and the action!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really really good game just need the pc to run it probly
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Multiplayer!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's a good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another CoD title fro IW, great graphics, good gameplay as always with IW. INteresting campaign in a wide array of settings, although pretty short, unless you want to do a lot of multiplayer a 4-5 hour campaign might not be worth the money. New 'zombies' mode looks interesting. All in all it'll come down to the MP as with most CoD games. 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dear haters of Call of Cuty: Ghosts.   If you say CoD ghosts sucks because of the blurr in the graphics there is a way to fix that. All you need to do is go to the options, video, advanced options, and raise the FoV all the way up and that will make it go away."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dude. Bro. Yeah. It's COD, Jim, and just as we know it. You come to COD for the AAA Action movie experience and it doesn't disappoint. Awe-inspiring settings, mad and pointless plotting, oodles of toys and a multiplayer where you can get called horrible names by 11-year-olds. Will it change your life? Good grief, no. But you'll enjoy the ride, and that's what COD is."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm using windows 8 with Intel HD 4000 graphic cards and the game works fine(I guess *way too slow during loading) but when I get to the mission 'Federation day', the game crashes... I tried restarting capaign, mission etc. but it still crashes... fix bug pls"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game kicks major â™¥â™¥â™¥,enough said!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Cod EVER!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,riperr can i buy it free 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"dont quite get the hate, the game has been updated which fixes allot of the laggy issues and added FOV...kinda a fun game just to chill out for a bit and play. worth it at the sale price not full price however."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,And yes and no there is a lot of cheeters who hacked the game and nothing done from steam. another piont is not all EU countrys are included in game when you want to create o register clan as I'm not f***g Polish or Russian so that means you can't register game or create your country clan RUBISH!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't recommend this game at this time, due to the fact that during my initial 2.1 hours of play the game crashed twice and I have yet to attempt to play it again. So, at this point I am disappointed in such highly touted game being so buggy. I really had high hopes for this title."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly, a lot of people were disappointed in this game by big game reviewers. From my personal opinion, I love this game. The multiplayer has improved with the customization and both gender switches. As well as bringing in the dogs. I loved the campaign and it was jam-packed with amazing new technologies and fun events. I just wish the events occured and reoccured occasionally throughout the campiagn. I know people stay for the multiplayer, but Call of Duty keeps me for the campaign. The story compelled me. But I haven't played every Call of Duty game. Just the first two, this one and the Modern Warfare series campaign wise. 'It's just another Call of Duty game...' Well yeah! That's in the TITLE."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ahhh, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  Not only that but they aren't letting me onto the part of the site that contains the specs so I can see if I am compliant.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SHIT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love call of duty they dont compete with bf4 COD dont even want to compete i thunk ITS WHAY BETTER THAN BF4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its a good game ,although its not optimized for PC .Buying it on a console is better ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,GREAT game by me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love it!!!!!!! &lt;3 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love this!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a really good game but i have to agree with the rest of the ppl here... this game is not optimized for pc at all... i have a pretty beefy set up and for the optimal video to tell me to run everything at normal and turn everything off shows me they don't even have their stuff updated. :\ and for a game that doesn't look nearly as good as bf4 for me to have fp drops is just poor game polishment... but if you can look past all the disergard for pc gamers then yea its pretty legit... but its super hard to look past the insult.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a little brother simulator.   You play Logan somethingsomething and you're dad is a ghost (Not like Patrick Swayze), some sort of phantasm-based special forces unit that he told you about moments before GI Joe 2: The rise of Cobra entered the game in the prologue. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens for some reason, the european union (which is now entirely spanish) has invaded America and some other guy is trying to kill your guys because he used to be one of your guys.  Its a strange game because you're there. You're walking around. Fighting. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is happening, but you're rarely ever really involved. Oh, you have to shoot EVERYONE because the elite special forces ghost-men will clump behind the same cover and bark at you to get moving. A lot. They'll also walk past bad guys all the damn timed, but I don't blame them because everyone looks the same. But when it comes to opening doors, advancing the plot or, god help, you anything else its time you sat back and let the big boys handle it.   There is also a dog that you share an (Implied) psychic connection with, like its AD&amp;D and its you're familiar. But its there, then its not, then it is, then its shot and then it gets a purple heart and a retirement package.   Other things to watch out for, they've always had a habit of copying scenes from films and using them as set pieces (Because its not theft if its 'homage'), but usually without anything that made the original scene great. Earlier games got it, or at least got some sort of pass, but after so many years its hard to clap at the same tricks. They even call-back to earlier Call of Duty games, just with the effort and attention to detail of someone who works 9/5 in accounting.   It also features the worst tank section of any game I've ever played. Think the tank section from BF3 (because its basically the same thing), but with ugly, muddy textures, tanks that operate like dune buggies on ice and someone screaming in your ear to 'GET MOVING BRAVO' every five seconds. It'd be a little forgiveable if it was pretty, thats what got BF3's campaign off the hook (in my books, at least. Well, that and the last sections).   Its short. Five hours, and that was with a few resets after script errors (movement scripts, not story).   There are extra modes, extinction (Because Zombies is a blackops thing) and Squad mode (You and an AI Team VS another guy and his AI team. Its multiplayer if you dont have the twitch reflexes of someone younger then you)   Its like a bad Tom Clancy novel/game, except even a bad Tom Clancy game is at least interesting. Sort of.   Ghost pun.   Also, the only reason they give everyone masks 90% of the time is because it means they dont have to spend time rendering facial movements."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is better than expected however the game is the same old call of duty except with a 55gb install and crazy performance problems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's a awesome game, play it everday insce i bought it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This FPS game is awesome instead of zombies from the earlier frachise it has ALIENS!!! And its freacking awesome...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I enjoyed the single-player a lot; still learning the ins and outs of multiplayer - I'm not very good but I'll get there.  However, the game runs like crap on my system, and I'm not sure why...  EDIT and UPDATE  So, now that the new nVidia 337 beta driver is out, the performance of the game has increase quite a bit for me. Bot the SP and MP games are playable, and I'm find MP pretty fun... except the cheaters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What pisses me off: If you already owned it you don't get a free upgrade to Gold Edition which is the same price for what I bought the normal edition for. It's a total ripoff that people get the base game, a DLC, and a skin for it while I get just the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like call of duty: ghosts but you creators really messed up zombies mode. Next time you make a call of duty put more than just campaign and some thing else make them all the ones you alredy have made. That way zombie lovers AND alien lovers get the 'best of both worlds.'   - the forgoten soldier
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really worth it. It has great gameplay and weaponry. I enjoy playing with friends and multiplayer. I do recomend this game but the one thing I dont like is how long it takes to rank up.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WAT DO YOU THINK I THINK.....?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's alright. It' s no BF4 or L4D2...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,smooth play great maps awsome graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dumb asses complaining of 'not optmized for pc' need to get a clue and a new vid card. Game works great even on my old system with a NEW generation vid card.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, but if you play multiplayer be prepared for hackers and people who have no lives that play this game religiously. You will lose constantly. I still enjoy playing though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really haven't cared for the Call of Duty franchise since COD: WOW, but I'm really lovin this one. I feel this game has really stepped away from the FFA paintball feel that became very prominent in BO2. I Really like this game:)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"100% GOTY. First you are an astronaut,then you are a frogman then you drive a tank. It's really refreshing and original. I was running around shooting people, next minute I was on a helicopter with a minigun. But you have to watch it because they get really hot and you are not allowed to shoot anymore. So I took it easy. There is a bar which gets all red and shows you how hot it is getting. I generally let it get like 75% of the way and then I stop for a bit. It's a pain but it's pretty much realistic. I talked to a soldier once at Someplace Else in the city and he confirmed that you can't shoot a real gun forever, which is pretty much what I had expected. Kudos to Infinity Ward for taking the high road on that one. Anything less would be an insult to the real operators that keep us safe in our beds at night time. But I did not like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dog. I am not an alsatian fan . They are an oily dog and the smell gets on everything (especially couches)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game Is AWESOME I Would Recommend it 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game. love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Woo loads of fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very nice but needs more maps!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Thos is an awesome game. Highly reccommended!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Graphics are pathetic 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros: The Singleplayer Campaign is longer. The Graphics looks amazing. Good Characters. New Weapons.  Cons: Unrealistic Gun sounds. Same old Call of Duty game. Maps too large for 12 Players. Call of Duty App is not available in some regions. Ghosts is not optimized for PC, Stuttering, FPS Drops, Screen Tearing, Low Texture Mode, Crashing and Bluescreen problems. Have to wait too long for updates.  Verdict: Call of Duty: Ghosts is a great game but poorly optimization makes it harder to play. If you can't deal with this problems don't buy until the developers fix this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty good graphics and game play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best fps game in the world
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its getting cost to mutch. for what u not get. is plesure:S i hope cod fix teir connection problems soon 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not the worst... but not the best either cuz it does have new features and a good campaign but it's just the same game with different guns, maps, dlcs, and play-styles..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love the game. Play it everyday. Just wish they'd punish the hackers!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is my first computer game FPS and i have to say it is VERY good i dont know why people hate on this game if the graphics are bad get a better graphics card they will look amazing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's a good FPS game,but not good Call of duty. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a nice break from all the modern warfares and the gunplay has improved. the custom soldiers is great. one thing that needs improvement is that the guns sound far too weak and the attack dog is like jesus.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolutely great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,wait till fixed then buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fairly good. Could be less laggy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool game love it &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game performance sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Of all the games I have purchased this is the most unique I believed that the unlock system would be a bit like MEMP however i was incorrecxt and this proved annoying however i do enjoy the plot lines of the campaign overall it is a great game if i could stop getting spawn killed
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think the game is cool 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's good but it still needs a lot of work to be done to it to be very good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not a bad game,classic cod"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yeah but sort the lag out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not to bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I quite like it, play it with friends and its fun :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game Good Campaign Keeps you on the edge for the next game from IW Not very good from IW For PC Users because they made us use 6gb of RAM But the patch changed that and now its all good no bugs anymore good happy and will keep buying Call Of Duty's
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I install COD: Ghosts, and its not start. What shall i do people?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought this game 4 months ago and still wont play what a waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this games sniper gamepaly is epic
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its not a bad game not the best and its a COD game so didnt expect a huge jump in graphics but my pc handles it well so im happy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"for me, very simlar to MW3, apart of graphics nothing really changed, thats my opinion about multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's Amazing. The Graphics are Great and The Kills... Are... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Needs own sever...keeps dropping out and frezing.......sort out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After a bumpy start, as a relative newcomer to FPS the graphical glitches at the beginning didn't bode well, and delayed my progress a bit. as is the way as I got to the last chapter in campaign an update fixed my SLI woes, making multiplayer a viable option. Enjoyed the story, some nice touches, and with graphics fixed it does what you would expect nothing revolutionary, but then what is? On a par with BF4 finally IMAO."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well despite all the bad reviews i bought this game. i have been playing now for about 5 hours and have not been in any matches with hackers that i can tell and im guessing they fixed all the bugs that people were saying they were encountering because i havent had any problems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very recommend
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There needs to be more diligence in supressing hackers which i feel is bare minimum. Honest players enjoy a strategic game  untilizing all of the balance of load out options. marginal yes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont like the lobby system...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a fun game to play.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes...gameplay is decent and awesome graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I dont like the fact that the squads fight on there own when im away frm my computer. It hurts my record, and i get NO squad points, just XP points. (give me squad points) or just fix it to where it will not effect my record, then they can fight."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am a MW fan and I thougth it was the time for an upgrade. I was wrong. This game is not finished. I am having a high end gaming grid gtx 690 16 gig ram i7 and I am having LOW FPS, frequent freezes, lag... This is terrible. I am really sorry that i paid so much before reading any of the reviews and boufgt the freaking hardened pack... Listen to other reviewers and STAY THE F AWAY!  EDIT - Both game updates and Hardware updates right now made this game work smoothly with ultimate details. I had i7 920 CPU, it was bottlenecking the whole system. I have updated the mainboard and the cpu and game is running real good on i7 4770K along with 690 gtx.   I really like the game now. It is very advanced, and the levelling works like anything else before it. I can only recommend this if you have a FAST SYSTEM WITH A FAST GRAPHICS CARD. OTHERWISE STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player was fun and intense but way too short :( I would have been fine with that if it was only a $15 purchase. I suggest you play a friend's copy if you're only interested in the single player.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yay! Another Call of Duty game. Such fun, Much wow."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best DLC For COD Yet, Nice Graphics, Good Gameplay, Lots Of Things To Do. 88/100"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love the game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game i recommend it to everyone, story was fine sam as graphics"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have seen alot of bad reviews on this game, but i still went to buy it, as it was cheap in a sale.  COD Ghosts is not a bad game really; the singlplayer campaingn is meh, but the multiplayer is decent. I recommend you buy it if you either have loose money around, or you'r just a 12 year old kid who has COD so far up his backside... well you get the point :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game is really good but  I made a cod account and linked it with fb twitter and ps account and then i downloaded the android app so after that for no reason i cant play multiplayer because ,as it says , i am vac banned. I dont know what happened and now the game is useless."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I can barely get a game online, and when i eventually do get in a game, it is full of semi â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ people camping like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they are. please fix this because your games are going up the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  thank you going to buy bf4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghost is a really good game. There was work put into the graphics and the into the developing of the story, of this game. I LOVE the ending of the game. There are onely two problems that I have 1: on the mission 'no mans land' you play a bit as your dog, and when I attack some of the enemies with him he just jumps right through them. 2: the game is too short and you get bored of finishing it 20 times. This is still a good game and one I enjoy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought a new character, but I not found in the game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love this game, hour of fun, the people that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game must just suck at it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Everybody says its a bad game but i like this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best one yet
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun game, good come back from a few bad years of CoD games. Just wish there was a larger PC community"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if your computer can handle the insane requirements for this game, its actually a very pleasant eperience. yes, there are alot of optimization issue, that is very fair to say and due to this error, the multiplayer servers are very dead. with that being said, this should no put down the single player section of this game.  I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign of call of duty ghosts, the storyline was incredible, and had me captivated from start to finish. 8/10 if your PC can handle it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Yes I do recommend this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazing game I love It !!!!1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Maybe? Multiplayer in PC is worst! Hard to get in the lobby..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is ok, but there are too few online players in some gametypes. There is a lot to fix with the multiplayer, but it isn't impossible. Just fix the stuff so we can play where we paid for. Maps aren't really better then previous COD's though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm trying to download it to my new computer from Steam. They say it will take two and a half days to download the game that I have played for a while on my old computer. Excuse me, ya, two and a half days. I've tried to get ahold of some one at Steam but I get this increditable password run around from them and can't contact any one. I've never experienced the kind of anxiety that I have using 'Steam'. Holy Crap. Unbelievable. :-("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is great; you just run in and go pew pew pew pew and everyone goes to sleep. Sleepy time is happy time. See this is why you must always fight the dogs because dogs go all woof woof woof and wake up sleepy man.  Now some may be jealous at my complete and utter understanding of this game but dont worry one day you too may understand.  Until then just remember get a good night sleep kids so you arent tired when the pew pew pew tries to make you sleep.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign I enjoyed. I do love the campaigns in the COD Series... My only one I didn't enjoy was the WaW one...  However this wasn't the game I was expecting when I stayed up till the unlocking of it to get a first look. Multiplayer is awful EXCEPT for my favorite game mode: Search and Rescue.  And Squads... Squads is probably my favorite thing to do on here.  It's a decent game, but certainly not the best this series has. Let's hope their next one(We all know that's gonna happen) Isn't as bad as this one.  I recommend the game solely for: It's campaign, and playing Multiplayer with friends."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A solid CoD game.   Haven't played through the singleplayer as i got bored with it after just a few hours so this is a multiplayer review only.  The maps are varied in size and content from cluttered city streets to more open 'clean' maps. Though it is harder to hold down an aerea or camp out as there are tons of flanking routes all over ( hated this in the beginning, now I've gotten used to it and am starting to like it even!). The game is not as fast paced as Blops2 and you die FAST if shot at with only moderate skills. Because of this i had difficulty playing well in the beginning ( i think the run-and-gun players got the better of me before I was able to anticipate their movements). Revenge-spawning keeps you in the action most of the time to the point that you will spawn in enemy sights too often.  Guns are also varied and feel good to use although tryhards will gravitate to 'that one gun' all the time, wich i find highly irritating (ak-12). It seems the guns are well balanced this time around. Certain classes of gun wil dominate at their aloted range intervals for once.  There is next to no f***ing quickscoping. But noobtubes are back, although not as OP as in MW2...   So is it a good game?   YES - I've soon played 200 hours on this one and I don't plan to stop any time soon!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hack lobby site pls 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game but u need to hav the PC for it lot of people are stupid and bought the game . BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not so bad game could of had more maps ect . and lesss laggin but if you can get past the lack of maps it is Realy a Good game . as long as your pc is good you be able to play it .....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game will be one of my favorites game forever because this is survival of the fittest. wow oh yeah!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Best COD EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is great,the graphics is better than call of duty modern warfare "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing COD game on PC I have played on in a while. Feels good getting back into COD. Lol jokes. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that.. Average game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love this game but I perfer BO2 because there is zombies but I think this is a great game to play.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome storyline, Grahpics are amazing! Gameplay is awesome, People are nice!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Edit: Finally, the bug was about crashing with current nvidia driver. Downgrading it helped me able to play them.  When it comes to story, it is the second best of cod series. I hope they fix the problem soon or i wont buy any cod series. Looking forward to play Ghosts 2 if there will be one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this game if you are expecting something different than any other COD game ever. Buy it because you're tired of killing people in mw3 and you got it on super sale. Buy it because you get to run around with a puppy who kills people. Don't buy the map packs, that's stupid. When you get tired of killing people in this game, buy the next one, and so on. Stop pretending these games are any different from each other or the next one is going to be better "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i think this game needs more skillcap than others CoDs, this cod has good graphics and is fun to play"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game but yeah dont like the maps because its hard to find enemy in the map 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Stop whining start Winning!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really fun!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i would only recommend this game for the single player, as for me the multiplayer is laggy? or my fps drops all the time. allthough i didnt seem to have that problem in single player. i also would wait for it to go on sale before buying. o online multiplayer has at most 600 pople on at one time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun just like all the other CoD games, except Black Ops 1, die forever, but anyway...  Story is pretty cool, I like how its home in the US, but at the same time a global struggle. Gameplay is nice and tight as I would expect. Game plays very smooth. Multiplayer is pretty much the same ol fast paced run and gun which is nice if you are into that kinda gameplay.  I like the app that you can get and be able to use it with clans, check your stats, get in game reward bonus's.  I'd recommend this game as I recomend most CoD games. Its simple, fast paced, fun to hop in for a few quick games and go do other things.  Enter the trolls that have nothing better to do...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I did enjoy the campain mode even thou it was very short. Not worth full price but I got this game on a black friday sale. I originally bought the game on the xbox 360 and the multiplayer for the xbox is crap. I have not had many problems with the multiplayer modes. I do enjoy playing Extinction mode online. If you can find a good steam sell its worth getting. Dont pay full price.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Lots of complaints about the game but in my opinion it plays much more smoothly than previous games and I have had no issues so far. Definitely Reccomend.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,'This game is like the other call of duties. Exept its better because it's newer' -Everyone that bought this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not Bad? But After BO 2? I can't call it so COOL! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"most people say this game is trash, but honeslty i love the game. Would defiantly buy over bf4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is one of the best cod games yet a must have for old and new players of the franchise
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS: + Gameplay fun and engaging like COD has always shown + Graphics are definatly compedative in this new generation  + Ability to practice with bots + Extinction is absolutly the change they needed from Zombies + Campaign is only 6 or so hours however it is enjoyable and engaging the entire way through. + Weapon, charachter and squad customisation is really in-depth giving you the choices you have always wanted in a COD game + Neversoft is back in the gaming industry and has worked well with Raven and Infinity Ward to make this game  CONS: - Some might experiance lagg in online multiplayer - Multiplayer matchmaking system, lack of dedicated servers - Some maps are to large for 6 vs 6  VERDICT: 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it may have had a ruff start but runs pretty nice. the graphic options should be more detaild
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is TOTAL CRAP.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty Good, Def the Best looking COD. Multiplayer hasnt changed much though and the singleplayer story makes no sense"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not on the PC....its horrible....there is 5000 peopel online at this moment, rooms are lag city!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the more you play the better the game seems to get :P
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I recommend this game. It still needs a bit of work. Single player is pretty intense. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is broken. sucked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,More realistic better graphics better weapons
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I liked the game but thought the campaign was short and the multiplayer maps really small. To the point that it's a lot of guys in a small area, and you die...alot. And there are no vehicals. I got it just to get it. but I usually fall back to battlefield 4. Was fun but aint advancing my character."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great story, fantastic gameplay, brilliant mechanics, and all the issues the game has currently are most likely going to be fixed soon. Over all, a good buy, many people will tell you other wise either for the reason 'It's Call of Duty' and some of them actually complain that it feels different. The Extinction mode certainly has potential, the campaign was well done, had a good story, and was a good length. Squads mode is really fun, especially with friends. The multiplayer is well done, the spawns are already confirmed for getting a patch, and the mechanics in the multiplayer as well as the maps are wonderful. Overall a 8.6/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Game has Had its problems During Launch just like many othe Big Titles, how ever Infinity Ward have Done A Really Good Job To patch This, post in Campaign and multiplayer, i havent played much of the campaign but of what i did play, was very good, now we can all Debate on if this is realy a next gen game or is it any different from CoD's previus game how ever it doesent matter the game is getting stale, but not only that the mechanic/netcode is broken like crazy in this version and isnt helping with sales with the game, it is also taking the skill and fun out of the game, ovbiously on the campaign it doesent really play a big factor but its noticeable, on multiplayer is where it is really noticeable and even the most hardcore CoD Fans Are Saying previus games Were Better Than this one and i would Agree with them, this game needs a Solid Patch To Fix Everything, and then just maybe this game can be called a Classic CoD Game cas it isn't one at the moment, it is playable unlike it's largest Competitor Being BF4 as of 13/12/2013 how ever both game have their Problems. I would reccomend this game if its ever on this years holiday sale but as of yet, their are still too many issues with the game to be paying full price for it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Outstanding game, I love it...BUT...it's extremely difficult to get into any game under 'hardcore'....Im not sure if it has something to do with filters or what. I have waited almost an hour just to get into a room. I'm still figuring out alot of stuff...I would love to get into one of the new style games under 'standard' like 'hunt' or 'hunted' or whatever its called...I just cant figure out how. The graphics are excellent, sound is unmatched in any game I have ever played. The single player was a little.........short, for lack of a better word. I love the idea of buying weapons and equipment before you unlock it. Which ever one of you guys came up with that....well done, it allows you to get bits and pieces to help your style without letting you get ahead of yourself. You boys (and girls if any) out did yourselves this time, great job. PS....I love that dog in single and multi ....nice touch"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,- Good campaign - campaign had like 6 30 minute levels - campaign was over quickly - got on multiplayer - 12 yr old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my mom  8/8 m8
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Guys, go buy it and we can play together like HELL YEAH!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the only CoD game I have, and I loved the campaign from the immersive storytelling to the realistic graphics, great mechanics, and overall fun experience. I wish I could say the same about multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COOL
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"ENG:  Just a good and efficient war game. Traditionally, the single-player story is it normal playback, the previous game series. Multiplayer is unlikely to be in any way special. The game price is just as bad in general game series will be today, and it does not want to answer any more the quality of what has been seen for the second time already, but I recommend the game if the game happens to interest.   FIN:  Ihan hyvÃ¤ ja toimiva sotapeli. Perinteisesti yksinpeli tarina on sitÃ¤ tavallista toistoa, mitÃ¤ edelliset pelisarjat. Moninpeli tuskin on mitenkÃ¤Ã¤n erityinen. Pelin hinta on vain huono kuten yleensÃ¤ peli sarjalla tahtoo olla nykyisin ja se ei tahdo enÃ¤Ã¤n vastata laatua, mitÃ¤ on jo toistamiseen nÃ¤hty jo, mutta suosittelen peliÃ¤ jos peli sattuu kiinnostamaan."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is amazing 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS A GOOOOOD GAME!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good multiplayer gameplay .   Strong stroyline singleplayer campaign , no other game in the market have done so well like ghosts .  And turn the vsyn off in singleplayer campaign , as the intro and midgame cutscence will stutter if vsyn turn on . Turn Vsyn off problem solved.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game isn't as bad as I was expecting, but from a Next-Gen Launch Title perspective it sucks. The optimization isn't so good, but there's now an FoV changer. This game is surprisingly more stable than Advanced Warfare. Also has some weird DLC, like a Snoop Dogg announcer and Weed Camo. If you just want a simple Run-and-Gun game with Okay (For 2011) Graphics and a Stupid Campaign, this one's for you.  3/5 'Average'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This new Call of Duty keeps the essence of the franchise but adding some new elements that, in my opinion, raises the game to a new level.  Perks are now elegible since the very beginning of the game and so are killstreaks. There is a good variety of weapons and options to customize. Zombies mode has now changed to Extinction mode (zombies are now aliens), the way to play this mode is totally renewed, you will not die so easily and you will be able to improve your character on the go like in a RPG. Customization has been improved too, allowing to choose clothes, face, hat, cammo... you can even select a wolf skin to your dog companion (DLC purchase) As many other games, there will be DLCs that are not included in the game and you have to pay for them. These include new maps, weapons, skins, chapters for extinction mode and some more stuff yet to know. As you may guess, these packages are optional and add new features to the game just in case that you agree to pay.  Amazing game, unlimited hours of multiplayer, brand new extinction mode and customization options, clan wars accesible to all players wether you are a pro player or not, companion app available for tablets and smartphones. Definitely, a recommended game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is the best game ever 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i do die a lot mire then i kill in this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its great :)!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,works for me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I won't bash this game as I like it a lot, but I will say that when I picked it up it was a little broken. Plenty of things have been further optimized and patched for PC and since picking up the Onslaught DLC it runs just about perfectly when my settings are properly adjusted for the type of laptop I use."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game but is it any different then the last is it really
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Speaking as a person who doesn't like the Call of Duty franchise I must say, this one is actually quite good! Singleplayer is OK, but Multiplayer has a handful of co-op modes which I'm enjoying greatly. Thumbs up!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ehhh this game isnt the best, but its fun to play...and dawgiesss! :3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the usual... fun with friends, gets frustrating as usual but yeah"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Exactly what I expected from a CoD game. I like it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst of the Cod games i suggest that they should give up there jobs and drive of a bridge plz
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game looks nice and gameplay is smooth (dispite the complaints I red, all it takes it a proper system I guess).   This is the first call of duty game I play and I really like the story, so I cant really tell if when you are a loyal CoDer you should buy this game.  60 euro's is too much for a game, but for 30 euro's in my opinion it was already worth the money for this game.   When I tried the multiplayer, Ill make a new post/update this post.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If your like many who play, you just can't seem to get enough of this highly addicting 1st person shooter. Multiplayer of course is my favorite, however; am a little disappointed that extinction did not compare at all to zombies. Regardless, COD Ghosts is deffinetly something you should play if you like to shoot stuff up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WOW. lost of wineing but no cheese. LOL no issue if you got a game rige. Quit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ man up and play!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not a fan of the Call of Duty franchise, but the amazing story and exeptional playability of this game makes it a game that I can play for hours on end."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really really good Campain Multiplayer is Okay.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you loved CoD 4 then this game is great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Interesting, will be blaging a second time"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The fish move out of the way. 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game to play. I liked Black Ops II better but Ghost is not a horrible game. Not the best but still worth playing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was a huge fan of mw3.. Even though there was the casual bad spawn points and op'ed weps..  But this game.. Do not buy it..  I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.. You start at rank 1 and have to fight ur way up in ordrer to unlock perks weps and a lot of other things.. But compared to mw3. This game is taking ages.. Ur a damn meat shield until you get certain perks which is not unlocked before rank 30..  This game is totally not worth it, and I greatly regret buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is great Steam fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to many Hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very nice game but like always too small maps:( anyway good job
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One thing I don't like about this game is that you need enough RAM
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Extinction rocks~
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphics are good, SP was good but not as good as COD MW3. MP in COD Ghost is great. It needs dedicated servers though if Infinity Ward wants to thrive as the best MP military FPS. I didn't regret buying COD Ghost. A lot of COD haters out there so beware of gang warefare reviews. I like BF4 presently but hated BF3 like it was a plague to MP military FPS due to its hacking loopholes. COD Ghost has not manifested any of those issues without reprecussions. Get COD Ghost on sale and I believe you will be a happy camper, sniper, knifer, etc"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'The core of the game is very good, but the very high max ping in the game (800) and bad spawn placements can make the game very frustrating at time.. other than those 2 things, the game is really awesome.'  After months of no performance patches and fixes, I have to say DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  It runs sparatically. Frame rates drop, and the spawns are unbarable. People will spawn withing 10 feet of each other and sometimes right on their screen. The ping and lag is also unbarable unless you live in the most populated areas. I am in south korea, but I can even get a decent connection to japan and china. I have heard a lot of issues on US servers too though. The game will often connect someone into the game that is very far from the others in the same game. This all makes for a lot of frustration."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is very good game but there needs to be better controls on Multiplayer cheets. There seems to be a lot of boosting and cheating going on when you play Multiplayers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Greate game of all time. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why it's say that i need to install stem?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love THIS GAME SO MUCH i beat Singleplayer the ending is awesome play it until the end everyone:)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,full of hackers 5/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recommend Call of Duty: Ghosts. it's a fun game to play. i love the physics of the game. Find the right weapon for you, go out there and kill everyone. It's so fun! Very good first person shooting game. Probably the best i've played yet so far. I hope Infiniteward keeps up the good work!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but man they need to fix the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like the crappy spawns and lagg issues in the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game kicks major â™¥â™¥â™¥,enough said!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game, and the grafic is so good &lt;3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, but suffers a very short story line. Still recommend for the Multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Highly recommended for Call of Duty and Battlefield fans!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game yeah its got problems but ohwell :D   
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Im glad that Call of Duty finally added a 6 player coop against AI..with friends now they need to lets us med each other like the Zombie versions.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,And yes and no there is a lot of cheeters who hacked the game and nothing done from steam. another piont is not all EU countrys are included in game when you want to create o register clan as I'm not f***g Polish or Russian so that means you can't register game or create your country clan RUBISH!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Glitched. So much glitches to an average game. I use an i5 processor with HD 7770 GPU and all other requirements on more than recommended. There are times it hangs in-game or even just on the main menu. It does not happen a lot. What happens a lot is the texture glitches that block out the entire screen in-game which disappears if I switch weapons. It's so frustrating especially when I'm using my favorite weapons and it wont' go out unless I restart the game. It also happens on multiplayer, which using your favorite weapon is very important and almost half of my deaths occur because of it. Couple that with common multiplayer CoD glitches like you die even if you shot first, some shooting accuracy issues, etc. It's so unfair. But otherwise, it's classic CoD fun when it works. meaning the biggest change is you have a dog. And I just lost more than $60 because I bought it retail on my own country. I do recommend this game if you can stomach all my gripes. It's still fun, but with much more frustration and some excitement lost. It's playable but I can't help but wish I could have my money back to buy Battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game reccomend it to anyone! Frame rate was also great and it isnt to demanding :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cool
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best stories so far in the call of duty franchise in my opinion. worth the money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is Amazing you will not play a better game best multiplayer of all the Call of dutys and best singleplayer ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game... highly recommended. For those crying here buy a proper graphic card and stop crying ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,one of the best games that made my holyday better.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game. No lags (I mean it) No bags (I really mean it) Multiplayer is not exatly same, but I won't say that it's bad It's not the worse game in Call of Duty collection, but it needs some calibration.  7/10 single, 8\10 multi  ÐžÑ‚Ð»Ð¸Ñ‡Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð¸Ð³Ñ€Ð° Ð‘ÐµÐ· Ð»Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð² (Ñ ÑÐµÑ€ÑŒÑ‘Ð·Ð½Ð¾) Ð‘ÐµÐ· Ð±Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð² (Ñ Ð¿Ñ€Ð°Ð²Ð´Ð° ÑÐµÑ€ÑŒÑ‘Ð·Ð½Ð¾) ÐœÑƒÐ»ÑŒÑ‚Ð¸Ð¿Ð»ÐµÐµÑ€ ÑÐ°Ð¼ÑƒÑŽ Ð¼Ð°Ð»Ð¾ÑÑ‚ÑŒ Ð¸Ð·Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð»ÑÑ, Ð½Ð¾ ÑÑ‚Ð¾ Ð½Ðµ Ð´ÐµÐ»Ð°ÐµÑ‚ Ð¸Ð³Ñ€Ñƒ Ð¿Ð»Ð¾Ñ…Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¢Ð°ÐºÐ¶Ðµ ÑÑ‚Ð¾ Ð½Ðµ Ñ…ÑƒÐ´ÑˆÐ°Ñ Ð¸Ð³Ñ€Ð° Ð² ÑÐµÑ€Ð¸Ð¸, Ð½Ð¾ ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÐµÑ‡Ð½Ð¾ Ð½ÑƒÐ¶Ð´Ð°ÐµÑ‚ÑÑ Ð² Ð½ÐµÐ±Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÑˆÐ¸Ñ… ÐºÐ°Ð»Ð¸Ð±Ñ€Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ°Ñ…  7/10 ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð³Ð», 8/10 Ð¼ÑƒÐ»ÑŒÑ‚Ð¸"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game isnt as bad as everyone says it is. Neither is it great. Multiplayer is fun and has a lot of new customizable features. Personally I think the campaign story is really good. Its a lot more tactical and the achievements are pretty easy to obtain. To get the best experience you have to try out different graphic settings and change your play style. After playing multiplayer and the campaign id say go ahead and buy the game but also dont expect a flawless next-gen game. Most importantly..HAVE PATIENCE!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun and fast shooter game require some skill. lot of cheaters but we will prevail !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Meh, it does things. And you get to shoot stuff. Wait for a sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE END IS SO DISAPOINTING THERE NEEDS TO BE A SECOUND CODG 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so good good game i recomend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,you can send riley to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them up :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Watch out for them hackers! Disregarding the CRAP graphics on even the high-end gaming machines, this game would get many more thumbs up from me if the playing field were naturally-inspired. WTB a real BAN hammer to get rid of all the people that weren't loved enough as a child, and have to resort to using hacks to enjoy Ghosts, ruining it for the rest of us.  My Honest Evaluation of Call of Duty Ghosts(PC):  With Elimination of the Hacks - 7.5/10 No Elimination of the Hacks - 1.5/10  With Graphical Improvements - +1.5 to evaluation score "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a fun game. I prefer the physics like MW2. More realistic movemnt here. Still miss the arcade feeling of the old MW2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,eh its okay why all dis
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its hard to get a game with out lag and thats with my 100 mb down load
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so awesome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hardcore Search and Rescue is the No1 game to play, and the extinction series is cool too in co op mode."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If I were to recomend this game I would say yes I love the campain and the multiplayer is amazing yea it might be not like Black ops II, But its an amazing game and it has good weapon balacnce. It has good maps like Black ops II except more range and like mw2 and mw3 it has a 25 special killstreak called the KEM STRIKE wich blows up and changes the map.    : )"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes, the single player and multiplayer are pretty much predictable. What makes this game so great are the private match and the squads mode. Going online as a noob on this is totally demoralising. Play private match and get use to the maps,modes and options and you can then play online and hold your own. The AI in private and squad mode is probably the best i've ever seen. Squad mode just keeps you coming back for more, it's totally addictive."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"hit my wallet upgrading specs on the pc i think everyone can agree to some degree, in respect to what the game became. having said that all in all a good cod game. it was ghost or bo 2. having played mw 2 and 3 ghost did a good job however, cheeky with the dlc guns.. alright single player.. mp: mayhem and no tactics, which is good and bad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,potato is good for your hair
Call of Duty: Ghosts,kickass story in this one!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Getting this to run adequately on my PC was a nightmare. Serious control issues..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Give this to that guy at work that you do not like
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THEY HAVE TO UNLOCK THE FPS CAP.WHY WE BUY NEW VIDEO CARDS AND NEW MONITORS TO PLAY ON 91 FPS COME ON.UNLOCK THE FPS CAP PLZ.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,expected it do be a little beter than it actualy is
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game enjoy playing every chance It get. Can be frustrating when it appears as though you've been killed by a player in a gun match who in the replay saw you before you even began to fire at them, but in real action the exchange of fire happned simultaously or you looked to get the better of them."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Suprisingly fun game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wow Such fish Much ai Many doge Wow
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awsome game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"great game, make sure you have a good video card."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know what people are complaining about, unless they have crappy setups. I'm running at highest framerates and settings on my MSI GP60 and never experience drops, freezes, or anything else these flamers are complaining about. It's a solid game. I'm not much for MP, but I'm finding I like playing it on Ghosts. I do miss the SpecOps feature of MW3, but it's still a lot of fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if you have friends with you can play this is totally awsome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a good game but not Perfect The MW series and Bo series were so much better than this 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Overall very nice game , but just not excellent !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"7/10 short review I don't understand why people hate it so much just because it's not different from the preceeding games, I mean it's still CoD, if you want something different then play another game. yes it doesn't require team work and is full of campers .. but thats how CoD i has always been... and a good player doesn't complain that much about campers  Detailed review Pros: -it was $15 during the black friday sale -the single player story is nice -cutscenes and voice acting are great -you can play as a female in MP if you want Cons: -min specs for the game is so demanding -MP maps are not well designed like other CoDs -the dog is overpowered -I had to do alot of research to overcome issues with the game (FPS drop, Lag, launch fail...etc) -doesn't have alot of players online .. but you can find a game in a minute or two  My advice: Buy the game if it's on sale for a good price $20 max  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is taken from the script of my unpublished Call of Duty Ghosts review.  ************  Call of Duty Ghosts! Donâ€™t f*cking buy it!!  *End of review*  No, no, lets just continue. Call of Duty Ghosts was made by a collaboration of developers, and it shows. You have Infinity Ward, Raven Software and Neversoft, whom made Tony Hawk Pro Skater and Guitar Hero. What a f*cking jump shift!  And what I mean by â€œand it showsâ€, is that is feels, *pause* Schizophrenic. The graphics are bland and look like last gen with makeup. The gameplay hasnâ€™t changed, same old cod... ishâ€¦   *Multiplayer* The multiplayer is nothing exceptionally new or ground breaking, some new modes are fun but its all a big lump of grey mess, WELP I could wrap it up just there but theres more to cover (not really). The multiplayer is made by Raven Software, and they did an â€œokâ€ job overallâ€¦ yeah, continue! New modes are added but some are more noteworthy than others, such as Cranked, Hunted and that dogtag mode that revive your teammates. Cranked goes like this, kill an enemy a timer goes down from thirty, get another kill and it resets back to thirty again, donâ€™t kill someone in the aforementioned thirty seconds and you explode. Hunted is a mode where you start off with a pistol and sortof have to work your way up, by collecting weapons caches. And that dogtag mode that revives your teammates goes pretty much like that, friendly down? Pick up his dogtag and heâ€™s revived! Simple enough. They have also added a new AI squad feature but I didnâ€™t really care much for that, so f*ck it, another thing is a player vs bots mode survival style also put into the mix, mhm its alright.  *Graphics?* Ok, now we can move on to the biggest aspect of this game, its awesome NextGen graphical fidelity and the LACK OF IT! Sure theyâ€™ve added new features like tessellation, a nifty subdividing technique, Nvidia Physx support apparently, godrays, but its all just, I donâ€™t know, â€œmehâ€?! I saw a comment that stated this perfectly. â€œIt looks like LastGen, but with some makeupâ€, yupp pretty much! But the more I play the awesome title of yore, I see that they are catching up with Crysis of all games, in the looks department that is. I donâ€™t know, they both are colourfull titles (would you believe) and features a lot of green. From a consumers standpoint it would be brushed off as looking seriously like LastGen. It doesnâ€™t deserve that, but it is true, to a degree.  *Extinction mode* Neversoft developed a new take on the Call of Duty Zombies, by implementing aliens instead. This is actually a fun addition. The Aliens move and feel alien like, they jump around, climb on walls and feels more in place than the whole zombie craze that the past Call of Duty games capitalized on.  *Optimization* The game suffers from massive lag issues on the PC, both netcode issues and optimization issues. Totalbiscuit talked about the poor performance on two F*cking Titans! He had to disable MultiGPU for the game to run better, but even then it ran like crap. By looking online I found some fixes to the performance. CTRL+Alt+Delete, goto Task Manager and set the games priority to Normal instead of High. Now the game will run better, but not as smooth as it should. In said Task Manager you will also find the game only using about 2Gb or RAM! The requirements for the game to run, to actually launch, you need 6Gb of RAM! WTF?! Not only that but to fix the high ping issues, I had to configure the games config file. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO!!! But, I digress, as I play this game more and more, it does start to become enjoyable. Granted I had to crank up the FOV to 80 or more so I wouldnâ€™tâ€™ suffer from headaches and motion sickness. Thereâ€™s now an FOV slider, not in the game originally, but its there now. Only goes up to 80 though.   *Wrapping up* Score wise, it is a 7 out of 10, just because the game grew on me and I found some modes fun to play. But itâ€™s not worth the full 60 Euros on steam, or $60 if youâ€™re fat and stupid. Its probably better on consoles, but since I mostly play on my AWESOME GAMING RIG, I had some issues (some, haha), but with them gone, itâ€™s actually a fun game, *pause* overall.  Oh and if youâ€™re wondering how its singleplayer goes? Hhaaha, donâ€™t evenâ€¦  ************  Luckily, most if not all issues has been adressed in the next title; Advanced Warfare. All but the dedicated servers..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game takes a while to get into it though
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice story line but teribble graphic
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best COD i have ever played keep it up people!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Steam Connect Faild. :S
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the best CoD I've played so far.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Similiar to the previos version, howver with newer features, such as space fighting, tank warefare, and a dog. Overall it is as i expected from the Call of Duty series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the game alot since I am a COD fanboy xD here are the pros and cons Pros -Really intretaining multiplayer experience -You can play for hours and hours -Decent single player campaign  -OK graphics  Cons -Horrible maps with alot of fogg -Sometimes its really laggy -Not alot of people play the game so it takes forever to find a game -Not alot of maps and very few gamemodes  from 1/10 I would give this game like a 7 and would recommend only poeple who like first persons shooters to buy this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Has a great campaign, the multiplayer however is pretty stale, always the same two maps. And there is almost no online community to try out the new features such as squads, or extinction. Would recommend for a single player fps exerience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is beautiful and is definently the best call of duty yet. They added so many little details like soldier customazation and particles, awesome perks (they are finnaly useful) and upgrading attachments with squad points is fun and easy the only bad thing is poor optimization they added many many more details :D 9.5 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, but the scene where you are tied to a chair sucks. I have been through the game over half a dozen times and the chair glitch stops me every time. It would be nice if they would fix glitches after they are aware of them. I know I am not the first to point out this glitch as I have noticed complaints online and in forums. The game is good, but the service is poor. It's like waiting for your drink at the table and the waiter never returns."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WOW. lost of wineing but no cheese. LOL no issue if you got a game rige. Quit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ man up and play!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single Player was a bit better than I expected, but so far: multiplayer is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hacking choas."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very Fun and exciting game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best game of all time, hands down. Addictive, fast paced, fun and social. Does it get any better - no it doesn't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hey guys this my first call of duty, and i love it but can you tell me how i can activate the multiplayer charakter code  thanks foreward  KEEP_SMIlING"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If loved MW3 then u're gonna LOVE ghost
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best stories so far in the call of duty franchise in my opinion. worth the money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well what can i say. Amzing graphics the only problem i have noticed is the RAM it sucks so much ram its annoying. my laptop thankfully has more than enough but think that should be sorted. online is a joy to behold i think personally should have kept nuke town in this game as that would have been amazing with the nuke going off when your fighting people and battling with a messed but map. over all good job 9/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just Meh like all the other CoDs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IRECCOMEND THIS IT IS SOO COOL PEOPLE WHO WRITE BAD REVIEWS ARE EITHER BATTLE FIELD FANS OR HAVE A BAD COMPUTER LOOK AT THE SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS I GOT A NEW ALIENWARE 14 IT RUNS THIS SOO GOOD 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hard 'Ghost - Gameplay '. =)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is bad in to it can run amd cards
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think its good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great story. Best story since MW2. However single player is rather short...roughly 6 hours. Multiplayer is tons of fun. Kind of confusing trying to get different setups. I'd prefer just being able to unlock everything by level instead of having to try and do special things with certain things equipped. Minor complaints, but very fun. Ran smoothly on my pc. 7870, 8g ram, 8350 AMD cpu."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why shoot your gun when you can knife/c4 everyone you see. pls fix riot
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward about Ghosts:  Yo, dawg, we heard you like flank routes, so we've put flank routes in your flanking flank routes..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth to big maps and so much frame lag. i should cost 20-30 euros not 50. (the comunity sucks)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Needs own sever...keeps dropping out and frezing.......sort out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Gun n run that all I see it for as my favorite battle game is BF4 but to chill out and have a game of gunning and running or capture ther flag i quite find it good fun this isnt about what best or what rubbish it is about enjoying it and have a laugh  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is not special or better than black ops 2 still you can have fun with the game. the multiplayer is awesome with new stuff etc....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a well rounded game just wish they gave you better options when it come to selecting maps in wargame.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought the game, went on multiplayer and was almost immediately killed by someone who flew through a building, throwing insults at me and my mother.   Well here we are again. The latest CoD installment. At the time of writing this, I have invested over 80 hours into this game, about 10 for the campaign and 70 for multiplayer. I wish with all my heart that I could say this game 'breaks the mould' or as the product description says, is 'an extraordinary step forward'. But I can't.   The developers have grown too accustomed to their huge sales and are terrified of changing the format in case they lose money. Sure, the graphics have been improved, there are new multiplayer tweaks to make the matches somewhat more interesting. Sure, things have changed, but nothing has CHANGED.   The game still employs the most basic point-and-fire system imaginable, so no matter how fluid it is, your mind is never challenged. You could play tense, lightning fast matches all night, but you would still have the brain of a potato. It's not stimulating at all. I found myself on the verge of dribbling once or twice.  CAMPAIGN: The campaign has fallen into the trap of 'bigger is better' but unfortunately, more explosions and more chaos do not make a better game. No matter how many satellites explode, however many dams burst and however many invasions are repelled, the campaign is not memorable. You never think 'Wow.' afterwards. It sort of fades from your memory even as you play. Maybe that's a good thing. At best, the storyline seems to be some very weak narrative linked by lots of shooting. The characters have no depth so you care little for them when they inevitably die in horrific circumstances. Masterful characters are written so well that you put your character in harm's way to save them. I cried like a child at the ending to Mass Effect 2 but the GHOSTS characters could be tortured to death with a brick and I wouldn't bat an eye.  MULTIPLAYER: Where can I start with the multiplayer? I think will start with the weapons. I don't know how many millions they had at their disposal but to present us with 8 assault rifles and 4 sniper rifles? That is pitiful. It's like booking a table at a fancy restaurant, ordering the 'lightly chargrilled buffalo rump steak with creamy cheddar slices on organic, wholewheat farmhouse bread'. And they give you a cheeseburger. It's almost insulting.  Also, the stats for each weapon are nearly pointless. The damage of any automatic weapon is irrelevant because your opponent will be dead before they have time to react even if you have the weakest assault rifle available. It's literally a case of 'who shoots first, wins'. And despite many experiments I did on how accuracy affects bullet spread, I cannot see the link. Precision marksman rifles and tiny submachine guns both appear to fire with near-perfect accuracy, with spreads of about 30cm across 100m distances. It's so hard to miss, that I sneezed whilst looking at an opponent, accidentally clicked, and killed them with a headshot.   I have not experienced one single occasion where 2 accurate shooters fire automatics at each other and the last to pull the trigger survived. The feature of the sprint vault (jump low obstacles while sprinting and carry on sprinting) is a nice touch, but it's affect on the gameplay is miniscule. Also, the slide feature was raved about, as though people have forgotten the identical purpose dolphin dive in Black Ops, which came out 4 years ago. It too, makes little difference in moving about the map.   MAPS: The maps have pros and cons, some major, some minor. The maps are all far too small to bother with the need for sniper rifles. With the ridiculous precision of the assault rifles and LMGs, sniper rifles are useless. The developers need to either degrade other weapons' accuracy accordingly, or make the maps at least twice as big. Don't believe me? Try the map Whiteout or Stonehaven which both have extremely long sightlines and I almost guarantee that you will be killed by someone who is likely using an assault rifle, often without the scope, from the other side of the map.  Some maps have dynamic qualities, such as shootable ladders or trees to make new routes (only 1 or 2 on each map) buttons which move some part of the map (eg a door) and in Tremor, guess what happens? Exactly right! Every few minutes, the screen shakes predictably.  As I mentioned in the first section, there are FAR too many hackers in this game. Perhaps in every 10-15 matches, you will encounter somebody aimbotting, wallhacking etc, which makes the game impossible for legit players.   CONCLUSION: The bottom line then. Ghosts is a great game, but it has made no attempt to improve on the previous installments. Call of Duty is a series with so much promise and so much potential, but they have been squandering it for half a decade. They are slaves to the customer demand, churning out a game every year or so to keep us happy, and refusing to change anything major, just in case they lose a scrap of their precious profits (insert Gollum joke here). And the thing is, it's OUR fault. We eat it up. Every poor game, every failure to take a step forward and we buy millions of copies to make them think that it's okay. They have worked out that they don't NEED to make big changes to keep us on a leash.   If you sent back a meal at a restaurant because it was cold, and they replaced with another, slightly less cold meal, would you eat it? You'd send it back again and ask why they haven't improved it. That is what we need to do with Call of Duty, and video games as a whole. Improvement makes things better.  If cavemen had never tried anything new, we'd still be sitting in caves, banging rocks together. Looking at people playing CoD, I wonder if we still are."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,anyone having problems with bad frame rates try to set the game on windowed no border instead of fullscreen. worked for me and managed to get my settings pretty high!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome game but 2 bad points system requirements and nobody plays ground war!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghostly 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So, basically it is a Call of Duty game. Overall, not terrible, though there are too many hackers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Epic Game,Must Try! :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game I really enjoy playing this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great storieline for a COD game. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Game!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,When i saw the trailer for the first time i told that this Cod game will be a great competitor against Battlefield 4....At 6 of December i bought the game and and after installing it on my pc i saw this F$#%*@! RAM LIMITATION.....The next day i was made to upgrade my ram from 4GB to 6GB and then i runned the game.....It wasn't even playable at the lowest settings.....ANOTHER ONE BIG DISAPOINTMENT AND I WAS HUGE CALL OF DUTY FAN....SORRY IW BUT I WILL NEVER TRUST YOU AGAIN!!! 54.50e TO THE GARBAGES!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Campiagn. Not the Best Multiplayer COD out there due to various plaguing issues found within. Steep system requirements only are justified for the Campaign not MP portion. Infinity Ward did a good job blending a variety of missions inside the Campaign that you never get bored. Visuals will vary depending on your system setup. Infinity Ward still has a lot of engine optimizations to pull off in order for the system requirements to justify the need for being so steep.   Overall, Great Campaign. MP not so great. Size of Maps are questionable in MP. Feels rushed to meet a street date. Performance problems are present. Visuals really shine in the Campaign while MP not so much.  Note: MP was played on the Xbox 360 version due to various PC technical issues that plagued me from playing online. PC MP was eventually played on a friends machine after some tweaking to get a half decent not so laggy game going. After 2 hours on the PC side with MP I saw enough to warrant my judgement on the PC side."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game nice changes, black ops 2 sucked terribly, caused me to stop playing at all until this one came out much better then before and a real attempt went into this one to make it worth while unlike the last."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's pretty meh. Not horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the best game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, can be a little repatitive, also; need to work on the trejectory of the VSR, not quite on the crosshair, otherwise, great game with a great campaign! 9/10 Revogaming.co.uk"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is fun and will be worth the $$$ once they patch it as it can go from fun to really buggy. Campaigne is solid, online can get better. They need to allow server selection rather then randomized game search as it places you in rooms with people many levels ahead.  Recommend to wait for a sale, which rarely happens with CoD, or once they update and patch the PC port."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Out of all the other Call of Duty games I've played, this by far is among my top personal favorite along with Black Ops! The campaign is amazing and very well developed. Not in a long time, since Call of Duty Black Ops, have I received such an epic feel when playing through the missions and experiencing the epic cut-scenes. It feels great to start a Call of Duty campaign with a different and fresh plot, along with new characters, much like the story from Call of Duty 4 Modern Wafare. The Multiplayer is excellent! The character customization is the best part for people like me, and the squad concept makes it better! The maps are good and the weapons and perk system is great and well balanced.  The game deserves great attention, and fans like me, honestly appreciate this game and the developers for their hard work. Again, this game is amazing and the campaign of the game is my favorite aspect. I am very much excited and looking foward to the sequel!  'Legends Never Die. The Ghosts are real.' 9.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As always it's just another 'COD Series'. It was good game play and and decent graphics (For a next Gen-Console Game). I won't completely bash the game. It was fun and I did enjoy playing. The story line wasn't bad and the end shocked me.. then kept me wondering whats next. I sat threw the credits and to my surprise there was a 10-30sec game play that makes you think.. 'humm'. Over all I would recommend the game to play. I do like the online play. Even tho it took the COD series countless games to start to figure out what the player wants. I also think the different game modes (Squads, Common Multi-player, and Extinction) are a good add to the game. I enjoy Extinction, even tho its not Zombies from Black Ops. It certainly has a feel like that. The set up for the players is good better then most of the last's. But as everything it has flaws. I do recommend the game and give it a go. What the worst that could happen?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I went into this game with very very low expectations however infinityward have surprised me. The multiplayer gameplay feels fantastic and the equipment you are given at the start is actually useful so higher ranking players are not overkill against new players. Hip firing also seems to result in much more missing so you actually have to aim to be accurate rather than people running around constantly shooting.  overall really good game and may finally be a CoD game I enjoy as much as CoD4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very good game. Didn't stray from the aspect and theme of the Call of Duty franchise which made it easy to jump right in and play without having to familiarize myself with it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is a very good GAME !!! MUST BUY!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Activision, InfinityWard really need to try to curb the hacks in this game, fixed the canister throws, and, oh, a few dozen other things. But, the game is least playable for now. ;-/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's Amazing. The Graphics are Great and The Kills... Are... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money. This game is a total fail and is the end of COD. Looks like we will be switching to BF4.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts is a great game but please fix the loading screens they take forever to load I know its not my computer because I can play the game and is fine but when it get to a load screen it takes forever or freezes. GOOD GAME BUT PLEASE PATCH IT. PLEASE FIX THIS DAMN PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME I SPENT 60 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥N DOLLARS OF MY OWN MONEY AND YOU HAVENT FIX THIS GAME. FIX IT NOW ASAP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well despite all the bad reviews i bought this game. i have been playing now for about 5 hours and have not been in any matches with hackers that i can tell and im guessing they fixed all the bugs that people were saying they were encountering because i havent had any problems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i like the game, would like to have the dlc pop up more often."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like the game but it is so laggy any tips to change thst
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a nice game but..... MOdern Warfare is much more better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a killer game good graphix and good multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you've played any of the call of duty games then this game won't seem like anything new...However, if you enjoy playing the cod series then you will like it...Great weapons. Could be a bit better optimized for PC but still delivers the goods.. Found this game to be much more enjoyable with a lobby of good friend/players...Be careful though..A few 'hacked lobbies' have created false VAC bans on some players that do not cheat and Activision and infinity ward won't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it, or state why, or give proof of the infraction. Although I know many have cheated and been caught, which we do applaud, some players have been thrown in hacked lobbies and paid the price later with a Ban..beware.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome campain the multiplayer is OK but it is a great game highly recamend it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun Gameplay, Good Story."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its awesome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is amazing i love it i allways recomend all cod games these ones are allways better than black ops ones semperfi :D and i would like strikezone as a map to allways play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the vibe of the game. Fun to play with friends but not very good in the solo mode.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fantastic game! I got it on sale and love it. I think the two styles of COD have a great merger in this edition.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a great game and has improved in many ways for the call of duty franchise many people hate this game for fun while it is good.  campaign- this campaign is brilliant it dosen't have the strongest story but it has the strongest gameplay campaign out of any call of duty , you can drive tanks, pilot choppers, play as a dog, have fire fights in space and underwater, repel down buildings etc. this campaign has brilliant and fun gameplay. the story focuses on two brothers their father and their dog and the story is interesting and cathces you in no doubt the story in not as good as the modern warfare series but it is still pretty good.  multiplayer- multiplayer is great, this games multiplayer has the best custumization system out of all the call of duty games with create a soilder system where you can create up to 10 soilders with their own class loadout, for your soilders you can custumize the look of your character play as a female or male where a green beret or a cap or helmet which clothes or play as fan favorites like soap, price, makarov, zakeav, keegan, merrick etc although the fan favorites you have to buy seperatly for a small price. then you can custumize your loadout with 6 weapon slots per soilder so for one weapon slot you can choose which weapon you want and what killstreaks and perks you want and the new perk system gives you more freedom also gun attachments and lethal and tactical equipment is their as well. this game has squad points which are very easy to earn by just playing online you can earn squad points and buy which gun you want and its attachments and perks etc so you don't need to wait to unlock a gun to use it just earn and few squad points done buy a gun. this game like all call of duties have a variety of fun game modes this game has alot of fun game modes such as cranked, hunted, infected etc. the maps are dynamic and big some peole don't like the big maps however there are also small maps and all the dlc's have small to meduim maps with great elements infact this call of duty has the best dlc's out of any call of duty game. Field orders are great and have alot in depth watch videos of field orders you will know what they do.   extinction- this is a brilliant game mode and the best part of call of duty ghosts extinction has fast paced action a variety of hostiles rank up system prestiging relics ,armoury upgrades class loadouts and alot of team is their in extinction. its alot of fun. the first map point of contact was simple and fun that was when extinction was just getting started then nightfall came out they had new wonder weapon called the venom x, the had some lockers, a brillant story exticntion has you can collect intel can watch video clips of the storyline. Nightfall also has the 2nd largest boss in cod history the breedor which you have to defeat. then in extinction the next map mayday was awesome the best extinction map it had buildables, 4 variations of the venom x, more aliens or cryptids more intel to continue the story and the largest boss in extinction and cod history the kraken which is such a amazing boss battle then the next two maps have more thing also you can see for yourself  squads- this has a ton of content in it it has safe guard, squad assault, squad vs squad etc it gives you more reply value and more content for this cod package.  overall a great cod game one of the best of course not better then cod 4 but this game is very well done I think this game is great."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty 7 or whatever iteration it is... is a decent Call of Duty-type game. Which is what you'd expect.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i only have one tip if you buy it just forget everything you learned from black ops 2 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the DLC'S a acuialy very good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is so good!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its ok but nearly 75% are camping in corners or are going to prone to shoot. If u like this &lt;---- its the right game for u!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game.If you love Call of Duty you will like it. Definetly worth of buying.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"yes, its a well thought out game with lots of things to pick from.the only down side is the ammount of people playing..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not that good, just ok"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Modern Warfare set a good standar for the Call of Duty games. Good campaign, special ops and great survival maps. They also featured much humour thanks to the British characters of Price and Soap. Ghosts is a rather quick campaign, set mainly in the U.S. and features some good missions. Sadly, you feel as if you're in a rat-run, even under the ocean or up in space. Georgeous scenery, but one hasn't any time to marvel at it, as you are rushed around. There isn't any humour and it's rather po-faced in places. Maybe Advanced will take up the mantle set by MW's series? Ghosts multiplayer is packed with different things and squads is very entertaining. I'm not sure it's as revolutionary as the makers said it would be. The graphics for me aren't as good in places as Black Ops and it's more of a strain on computers. It seems to be an all or nothing but the makers have included an option for 'dynamic fur'. Having played great games such as Fallout 3 and Fary Cry 3, maybe the way forward for COD is to make the campaign much more wider, have different ways to tackle fights and not have the same AI running in the same places everytime. Still, I do like all the COD games but maybe quality over once a year releases may help?   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game rocks!!!...Bigfoot is real...RRRR
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game absolutely love the series.. HOWEVER, the COD Ghosts for pc is very hard for the pc to run. The makers of this particular game in the series made it a little to intense for the pc gaming industry. I had to go back to playing cod black ops II. It runs smoother than Ghosts. Please use this reference in the future "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, good multiplayer and campaign"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hey this game is pretty easy and everyong is noob
Call of Duty: Ghosts,story is ok.. graphics suck
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well having beat the campaign of call of duty and played the multiplayer for an extended period of time. I think it's worth the buy. Yeah it's not revolutionary and it's not groundbreaking but it is fun and that's basically the point of gaming anyway.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't usually write reviews and now i wanna share something with u guys. This game is the 1st CoD I purchased, yes it has many performance problems on PC and I agree with all those negative reviews. But I don't regret buying this game and I did enjoy a lot. This is because the ONLY reason I bought it is extinction mode. The 1st time I saw extinction gameplay on youtube I instantly fall in love with it. When I actually play it, despite all these bugs and problems, I still enjoy it very much and wanna play more of it. And I only play this mode. I am not writing this to recommend u to purchase it, I just wanna say that: IT IS YOUR OWN CHOICE TO CHOOSE WHAT GAME TO PLAY. ONCE YOU REALLY CONSIDER TO BUY A GAME (AFTER SOME SELF-RESEARCH), GO FOR IT AND TRUST ME, NORMALLY YOU SHOULDN'T BE DISAPPOINTED. You can surely take others' reviews as suggestions but you will make up your own mind."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it should be 4gb of ram 8 is too much but still good game  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,still stutters after last update fix the game and don't sell rubish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Game is epic 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game is Amazing I love it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love owning these noobs with this game highly recommended it if you don't own it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome game but with the wrong pc it runs slow and acts up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great Running game no complaints here! fun single player and full xbox controller support (pc version).. i normally play with keyboards and mice but its nice knowing you can still have a fimiliar control scheme.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unlike many of the reviewers I had no problems with this game on my middle of the road gaming PC. Enjoyed the game. I am not sure of the value though as there was not a lot of single player gameplay for your money. I finished the single player in a morning (5hrs) and a good gamer could probably finish it quicker. The multiplayer is ok but it to could do ith a few more maps. Hope that there is some free DLC this time. Since writing this review I discovered the squad play mode, this has proven to be very entertaining now that my squad are well trained. I have changed my rating to recommend ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game have 2 place in cod games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great FPS game, but not as good as Black Ops 2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call Of Duty has been the jewel in the crown for Infinity Ward and Activision for over a decade with no signs of the franchise taking a back seat just yet. However Call Of Duty Ghosts did upset a lot of hard core COD gamers with the introduction of Riley the German Shepard. Although in the modern day of warfare dogs play a major part in the field and although this really *****d o** a lot of games but as you played the game you actually got used to Riley being at your side.  The dog cam was another aspect of the game which annoyed gamers. I liked the dog cam I thought it was really good. great for taking down baddies. On the whole the game is great, I found the start of the game a bit on the weird side, but once you get past this it flies through and youâ€™re thrashing your way through the levels. The level with the sharks was a real pain in the backside and I hated it because I kept dying all the time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"START RANT AND REVIEW This game gets a lot of crap and I'm tierd of it. Ya, the population on PC is horrible... well of course it is when you have people saying what â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics it has or it's the same stuff bla bla bla. Bull. The game is fun, it is playable and it is a bit more realistic even with all the fancy kill streaks (which are not half- bad). Is it diffrent that previous cods? Well of course it is! If you just gave it a shot and play the damn thing you will see my point. I watched a vid that was uploaded a week ago of some dudes game play for 42 minutes. All he keeps saying was 'look, see, its still all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up! oh dear god, kill this peice of crap game now and kill me!'  Really? I saw 42 min of nothing wrong. He â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed and complained for 42 munutes! Its complete tripe that people crap on this version of the game. There was nothing wrong with the game play in that vid besides the dude sucking so much because it was not 'arcady' enough. Sure he had a few good games, so why was he complaining? Becuase of the elitest trolls that ruin games like this. Don't be one of those people and learn to judge and think for yourself. Ghost is more realistic in terms of taking more cover. You have to work as a team and move like real units are supposed to move (breaching streets, smoke, frags, move in etc). And before you start in with the 'thats not how they do it argument in real life,' argument... just shut up. I know that.  Look. Before I end this rant, I just want you to know that Call of Duty may have a re-branding problem, it may change here and there and you have to adapt, but to out and out hate somthing in which you 'used' to be great at and now you suck because you dont understand concepts and adaptions and tacticts, give the damn game a fair try with fresh eyes and learn. It's no big deal. Thats all, just try it. It is a fun game and if you don't like it, fine. Don't play it then.  END RANT AND REVIEW.  (this was more directed to the elitest who hate this game when, in fact, they are crying for help on the inside. Admit it, its a good game and you have to work diffrently at it. End of story.)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS A nice game when there are players 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst First Person Shooter...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A fantastic game with only two issues. You don't feel that great a part of the story and secondly it's way too short. Maybe this franchise survives on the multiplayer these days but I don't care for that and want a good long solid single player experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I loved this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I prefer this to Black ops 2 but it is easier to join an online game on Black ops
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i looking some players for cod ghost add me ;) :*
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD Ghosts is not a bad game, it just could have been so much better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Recomended game ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's so-so
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game so far, i recommend it fully at least hit detection works!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didn't buy this game straight away because of all the negative reviews it recieved initially. I have been playing COD on xbox since COD4 and have owned every game since. I give this game a 7/10. It isn't as good as some of the previous titles such as MW3 and BO2 but still is quite fun. The multiplayer is OK, I prefer it on previous titles as I don't like the weapon building system, however the character customisation makes up for that with the ability to choose your clothes, headwear and gender."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's reet gud actually
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very competitive game awsome story line and amazing graphics multiplayer needs to be a little more connective other than that i recommend getting this game! ^_^
Call of Duty: Ghosts,mULTÄ°PLAYER Ä°S SOOOO GOOOD. Ä± recomending to you sir.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Let me rephrase that.. Ugly and disappointing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really dont understand why everyone has taken a dislike to this game as its not that bad at all... Its a COD game through and through, Infact, its one of the best Call of duty games within its franchise.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer isn't worth nothing and it's almost dead.  But Single Player Campaign is awesome to me. I just finished it and I highly recommend it. Wouldn't buy Ghosts for the full price again but if it was like -75 % I'd take it , just for the single player campaign and Eminem song at the credits.   Single Player 9/10 Multiplayer 1/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Typical Infinity Ward release this game is no where near as smooth to play as MW3 and its my opinion it should be these guys are all about money not about quality of product at this point I am sorry I bought it as I said typical of what I have come to expect from Infinity Ward!  I have changed my view on this game but hey it took ages to patch and fix it! If I sold a product the standard this was when released my clients would still be running me through the court system!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The pure brutallity of the campeign is just simply awesome. A few twists, a few unexpected outcomes.. Once again Infinity Ward have created an amazing story for people to get into. I cannot wait until the next Ghosts comes out as I.W. left me on an unbeleivable cliff hanger!   Once again, thankyou for an amazing story.  Unfortunatly I cant say the same for the online play but that is just my opinion, Judge for yourself's, but either way you wont be dissapointed with it   8/10 compared to other cod games from infinity ward"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love the game wish they could do some thing about the hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,works better than Battlefield 4 there is a hitbox on bf4 you can shoot where you want and no hit
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really enjoyed this game until the end. I still wonder what will be next of our player after being captured by what's his name. I believe that a good DLC release could be the continuation and end of this story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best fps game in the world
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, great graphics and great story :) 8/10 (Play it in hardest difficult for realistic experience, you are going to need some tactics hehe) TRY PLAYING SQUADS, IS A MUST!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,is nice 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game but could use some fixing Would be a great buy!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"my review is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game and steam,,,full of hackers,,,and steam dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,,,,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Help!! I rebuilt my windows 7 pc.. Same hardware that COD Ghosts used to work on.. Now continually crashes. I have a dual monitor and it just starts flickering then ... you guessed it, it freezes. Not sure as I have everything the same and it worked, now reinstalling 7 it's a no show. Can anyone help?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,get your settings right so you dont lag who cares if the game is ugly!!! play to win and you will LOVE it !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if u have any 2 ati cards u need to disable crossfire to play it with normal fps other then that its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is awesome. Great graphics and story line.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IF you have a better than average system..but must meet minimum requirements.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is garbage. I recommend you not buy it!! Moreover , This game has a lot of cheaters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is very fun, but it still hasnt been optimized... yet"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i have played arround 80 hours of multiplayer and have enjoyed most of that time the other spoilt by the hackers in the game , yes i do recommend ghosts with a small word of warning the hackers can spoil the game for the honest player but its still a lot of fun i have read about the problems some have had and i myself have had the wont start problem but i am sure with time this will be fixed as most games have problems at the start there have been worse experiences Farcry 3 springs to mind lol"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Frequent crash on starting maps. Only still playing because no other good current FPS's on steam. However, they have worked to fix this and of late there have been few issues. Currently the only steam-based FPS I'd recommend, as battlefield no longer is coordinated through Steam"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's a good FPS game,but not good Call of duty. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a nice break from all the modern warfares and the gunplay has improved. the custom soldiers is great. one thing that needs improvement is that the guns sound far too weak and the attack dog is like jesus.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolutely great game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought a new character, but I not found in the game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Love this game, hour of fun, the people that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game must just suck at it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game but u need to hav the PC for it lot of people are stupid and bought the game . BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lots of fun. Even more when you get the seasons pass
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice, I like it so far, love the Guard Dog thing...really cool"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i give this game 10/10 and not because im a cod fan iv played every cod every made and to me this is the second best ever made. the campaign is awsome, exinction is very good i like it better than zombies, squads is very good if you have friends playing with mics, multiplayer is the best part of the game the graphics,weapons,and maps are wicked cool "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, so there are a lot of reviews where people are just complaining. Typically it's from game freezing or from fps loss. The truth is if you have a crappy computer and try running it on high graphics it will look like crap. If you have a decent computer it will run better. There's no denying that. I have an HP G6 N7 edition laptop. It's customized with a Quad core processor and 8 gigs of ram. Strangely, it seems to work just fine for me. Good graphics, no freezing, no blurring... Looks and runs great. I won't lie and say the end of the story line doesn't leave something to be desired, but that's what happens when they set things up for a sequel."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very competitive game awsome story line and amazing graphics multiplayer needs to be a little more connective other than that i recommend getting this game! ^_^
Call of Duty: Ghosts,greaT I LOVE IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"typical call of duty great at close quater and great at a close quater shooter game , however certain levels are more open making it better for those sniper shots , weapons are easyier to obtain through a new system as you build up points during ranking called squad point or something simular , but if you know which weapons you want you can unlock them earlier than in previous games where you had to unlock via reaching certain rankings , i must say i am impressed as this has taken parts from mw and black ops and basically made it into one game and then they have tweeked it to make it better but however it is pritty much same old same old call of duty , which if you are and have been a call of duty fan this is a bit of a dissapointment cause it seems like they ran out of ideas to improve call of duty therefore the changes they made combining both games dont really make it much different and after about a month you will be dissapointed and a bit board of the same old same old story same old weapons , but the levels are pritty good which makes it that bit better be sure to purchase the map packs so you dont get board with the same layouts , the voice packs add a bit of flavour to the game , plus there is many more dlc as well , but as far as maps go basically the same as the game took old maps and tweeked them and added maybe one or two neqw ones which is a dissapointment .   one thing that most gamers will notice still no vechiles to control apart from helicopters in killstreaks , so if you want vechiles and wide open levels with big maps call of duty aint the game to buy , id reccomend arma 3 or battlefield 4 these are much more realistic army simulators , however if your just after close up shooting and fun call of duty ticks all the boxes as usual.  overall 4.5 outta 5  loses ten percent as it lacks ideas new ideas apart from that the game is damn near perfect , graphics are staggering on ultra but make sure your specifications are quite a bit higher than reccomended as it can be quite a laggy game on reccomended settings at ultra better that your computers spec can blow them wide open , i reccomend a 2gb 650 or above a quad core fx or intel at 3.5 ghz and at least 8gb of ram to get the most from high and ultra"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is fun you can injoy it and has great packs to buy it is great 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't bother, buy a blender and dip your sack in it instead..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nc weapons and nc skins
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the gameplay, a bit faster than BO2, still getting use to all of it. I would definately recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very nice art direction, nice style and feeling. But it's buggy, it's laggy and it has framerate drops on a high end machine, which is ridiculous regarding the graphics quality. Bad console port for way too much money.  EDIT:  framerate drops seem to be resolved and it plays way smoother now.  Overall a fun experience, if you're not playing for the story ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like it you just need a really powerful computer to run it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yea very nice game !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,itis col game i love it 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE GAME IS OK.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know where everyone was whining about when this game came out. It's not a bad game at all. People often say that they don't like COD anymore because it's always the same. And when Infinity Ward tried to answer that call, people were disappointed because it was like 'too' different. I just can't think of that.  But I won't lie, COD Ghosts also has some downsides for me. Like you die really quickly, and then there is this thingy called an I.E.D.   Another positive remark is the co-op mode (Zombies in Black Ops), I really like Extinction in this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,People just need to stop hating on this game the story is great and the gameplay even better runs great on my lenovo y510p all high settings and the online is fun so unless your a total noob who can't appreciate a good quality game or your computer just sucks horribly don't buy it other than that i highly recommend it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well to be honest at first, I know cod has been receiving some... or maybe alot of negative feedbacks. And i don't blame the players who are not liking this game. But to all the FPS players out there, you have to understand that this is not an easy game, it's challenging it's hard, and there's quite good competitive players out there. But once you get the hang of it and you start to understand how every perk will give you its pros/cons and every weapon will serve your gaming style in a different way. And alot of people complaing that cod has nothing new to it and its all the same blabla... well if you compare cod ghosts to other action FPS games, well i think it's the best in innovating new gameplay type, i mean what more they could do? And for those who complain about campers, trust me... I hate them too! but in every possible multiplayer game you will find campers and hackers, it is how it is. bottom line, i love the game :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Oh! Hi there my first review (on steam). So here you go..... It is a nice game with good controls, superb graphics, fantastic gameplay and ofcourse... great multiplayer. Campain: Great Story, gameplay is too good! You just have to kill, kill and kill the enemies! it deserves a 8/10. Multiplayer: Yeah... the real reason to buy the game!! You need patience to play the multiplayer because the opponents are very experienced, they are like experts... Play the game and slowly you will understand the tricks and loadout setup to win... The multiplayer is nice. though there are some lags and some things missing. I would give it a 7/10. I personally recommend this game to people to FPS fans games, and have played lots of Multiplayer FPS (any multiplayer FPS). This game takes the graphics to new levels!!! Go for it!  Overall: 7.6/10- Great game with some lags."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My problem with the COD games - at least the last few - is they are so linear you do little more than follow the leader. You can't really go wrong and end up somewhere far away from where you are supposed to be. Some may not like open worlds where you can get lost and have to grind through a bunch of things to get back on track, but I just don't like the 'follow that guy' storyline.  COD: Ghosts is in the same vein as previous releases. There is an in depth story line and you play your part in it. I stopped with the COD multiplayer at COD MW3.   For the price I paid it was a decent diversion. If you liked the recent COD games, you will probably like this one, also."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best cod games series ever . .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game, good multiplayer and campaign"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Kind Of Bad Quality For My Pc When I Have The Best Graphics Settings?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"START RANT AND REVIEW This game gets a lot of crap and I'm tierd of it. Ya, the population on PC is horrible... well of course it is when you have people saying what â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics it has or it's the same stuff bla bla bla. Bull. The game is fun, it is playable and it is a bit more realistic even with all the fancy kill streaks (which are not half- bad). Is it diffrent that previous cods? Well of course it is! If you just gave it a shot and play the damn thing you will see my point. I watched a vid that was uploaded a week ago of some dudes game play for 42 minutes. All he keeps saying was 'look, see, its still all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up! oh dear god, kill this peice of crap game now and kill me!'  Really? I saw 42 min of nothing wrong. He â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed and complained for 42 munutes! Its complete tripe that people crap on this version of the game. There was nothing wrong with the game play in that vid besides the dude sucking so much because it was not 'arcady' enough. Sure he had a few good games, so why was he complaining? Becuase of the elitest trolls that ruin games like this. Don't be one of those people and learn to judge and think for yourself. Ghost is more realistic in terms of taking more cover. You have to work as a team and move like real units are supposed to move (breaching streets, smoke, frags, move in etc). And before you start in with the 'thats not how they do it argument in real life,' argument... just shut up. I know that.  Look. Before I end this rant, I just want you to know that Call of Duty may have a re-branding problem, it may change here and there and you have to adapt, but to out and out hate somthing in which you 'used' to be great at and now you suck because you dont understand concepts and adaptions and tacticts, give the damn game a fair try with fresh eyes and learn. It's no big deal. Thats all, just try it. It is a fun game and if you don't like it, fine. Don't play it then.  END RANT AND REVIEW.  (this was more directed to the elitest who hate this game when, in fact, they are crying for help on the inside. Admit it, its a good game and you have to work diffrently at it. End of story.)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not worth the money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Immersive experience that is relentless in it's pace if you allow the story to drive you forward as I have been. Love it, love them all so far."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Some lag issues. With tweaked settings you can smooth this game up a bit. Clan wars is kinda cool but you have to able to play soft and hardcore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just awesome campaign by IW studio.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like the game but i dont like taht there is no people to play with
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best multiplayer of COD series in my opinion and also the singleplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you didnt get the season pass, your going to have a bad time. $130 dollars just to get every DLC?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is strictly for HARDCORE COD fans....only they will appreciate this title... SOLID SINGLE PLAYER, way better than previous camapigns. 7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alot of people say they hate this game but i would say this game is not bad at all . the reason people say this game is a peice of crab is becuz they die to quickly and that makes every player in the game angry so i believe this game should put thier health up 100% to make it fair !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a novice FPS Gamer. Played a little on the XBox360 but tend to have shyed away on the pc favouring strat, moba, adventure and rpg. Well bought this in the Steam Sale. Well, i'm really glad i bought this game. Check your pc can run it. (i only say that because it was in the top10 of graphics intensive pc games in a list i saw). The graphics are brilliant. i'm enjoying the Single Player storyline and is very forgiving on low difficulty so if you're rusty or just don't play many fps and want to give one a shot i'd definitely recommend this. Many different side elements have you in space floating and jetpacking around shooting enemies, repelling down buildings, controlling your attack dog to stealthily attack enemies, flying helicopter gunships to take out targets, using long range sniper rifle, using a silenced pistol with movement locator to take out enemies, aswell as normal assault rifle stuff in different stages of the sp storyline. still playing through the sp storyline so probably a lot more. All i can say is it's fun and coupled with the forgiving aspect, i'd definitely give it 10/10. If you're an experienced fpser i'd probably suggest you read another review for a more relevant opinion on the higher difficulty settings. I normally prefer multiplayer aspect of games (theres something sterile to me playing against bots but being a story its different) and have only tried the extinction mode mp with bots and for a very short time so cant really comment on the mp apart from saying its frenetic-i'll get round to playing mp with other players when ive finished sp storyline(campaign) i expect.. if i'd known the game was like this i'd have bought it full price earlier. there's lots of dlc mp i believe but not bought any yet. only had this game a relatively short period but loving it. jfi i'm using a 360 controller on my pc. it's a great, fun game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A fantastic game with only two issues. You don't feel that great a part of the story and secondly it's way too short. Maybe this franchise survives on the multiplayer these days but I don't care for that and want a good long solid single player experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game has a potential but need a lot of work til done
Call of Duty: Ghosts,realy good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Like this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best campaign and really nice new mode cranked and blitz.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice Game but not the best COD at least.... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a fanastic online game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy unless you have a amazing computer very hardware reliant
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game. All you gotta do is go to squads and play those and have fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game if they would just get rid of the laggg!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game made me sad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game the best of all call of duty love it ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same addictive gameplay as previous series with better graphics. Call of Duty Fans should not miss out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awsome game, but lot of campers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome Multiplayer. Cliche but amusing single player
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"although this game is heavy on my computers performance, it is a very detailed and fun game to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game crazy ending
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a really good game and I don't see why it has so much hate
Call of Duty: Ghosts,my call of duty ghost dosent work wich sucks 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pathetic excuse for a game. Multiplayer is always laggy because of steam, cant play single player with out internet connection. and full of hacks in first few months with no patches is rediculas. this is meant to be a semi realistic shooter. why all of the speed perks and stupid things? it i wanted to play a fantasy game i would play maxpayne3. this new DLC stuff is a total ripp off as nobody will buy it so you are stuck with the same 6 camped out maps in multiplayer.  Just the same game as previous version with another layer of graphics  Total money grab."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome Game, Love it. Alot of complaining by some, but had some issues at first, but worked out now and having fun. As far as Steam goes only thing I can say is your Awesome! Awesome graphics, sound and frame rates! Think I'll stick with steam, problems are minor and Steam always come through for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OMG its My Life&lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game. Nice storyline, gameplay and graphics. The online Features have a few bugs, but still is very nice game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game ever! If you want a really crappy game this is the one for you!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is one of the best COD and multiplayer is different but good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really bad... but addicting. I regret buying it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No problem to play when you have good machine. Graphic is bit below my expectations (and regarding hardware consumption), but it looks way better than any other game currently published. Maybe a small disappointment is very short single player campaign. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the game, beside the previously mentioned remarks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Game...If you liked the other Call of Duties or if did'nt then you'll really like this one, plus the single player was a lot of fun. I have played this game a good amount of hours the time you see is just the single player for some reason"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Speaking from point of some1 who doesn't really like shooters, specially in recent years (grew up on quake and similar stuff), i really like this game. I can play it for 1 hour just to take brake, or for whole evening which didn't happen for me since HL1 :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,extinction is fun. the campaign is boring.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thoroughly enjoyed the SP campaign. Great story, visuals and gameplay. Can see this being replayed. No comments re MP, haven't tried it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't worry, I don't feel pain anymore."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Story was ok.                   Not saying anything about that Multiplayer................................
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game kicks â™¥â™¥â™¥,cant wait for Advanced Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is a nightmare to load..........so far...I'm on the 3rd day ...and this mf is not loaded yet....says 15 hours to go.??? What the heck kind of loading is this ????!!!! The game is alright -- just the nightmare of loading it....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,im 13 years old i spent about 2 months saving up 60 dollars to but the game only to find out that the game doesn't work for me i get a 'directx error' so now im stuck with a 60 dollar game that does not work and the worst thing is i cant get a refund and its like the game is making fun of me everytime i see it so. i also dont know how to apply for a refund and i doubt they will give me a refund but anyways if anyone sees this and thinks they can help me please msg me?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you have played a Call of Duty game since the release of Big Red or anything after you already know how this game feels. It follows the footsteps of every other CoD game made. If you enjoy a few hours of fun but short story mode with shoot-em-up grinding kills and big explosions then the game might be worth a shot if you manage to get a deal. The price tag is obviously too high, I mean way too high. This is like waking up without your pants in a shopping mall fountian with three half eaten bags of cheetos high. The multiplayer is not as fun as previous games. I personally find it a lot harder to pick out players from the background and at this time (Later 2014) there isn't more than 3000 players on at a time, mostly European. There isn't a whole lot of familiar guns but many variations like the Ak-12 (to the AK-47) and some others. In sums:  -Short but fun story -Dying online community -Guns not commonly used in other games (Good or bad depending on what you like) -Majority of skins require you to buy them each at 1.99   If you can pick this game up at under $20 USD then give it a shot if not, don't bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a very good game in my opinion and many of the great features tend to be overlooked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its ok but the campagin freeked out graphicaly, like the lights turned black and white and i couldnt finish the campaign and multi player is laggy but extinction is awesome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well besides the fact that its almost the exact same game the spawn systems are worse then ever and the texture qualities are extremely poor its quite a good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"People who complain about the stuttering and saying that it makes the game unplayable are wrong! Yes, the game shouldn't stutter and should be fixed ASAP but this is still a lot of fun. To fix most of the stutter, disable the steam overlay and go offline on your friends. I know this is stupid but it's a temporary work around (I HOPE)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Review for single player. Pretty boring with some new twist's. Honestly the german shephard is only thing that makes this campaing it. I did like space fighting and what not. But, like Bo2 it's not a movie. It's straight up rushed 'Save the world' type deal.   Sadly awesome story setting was ruined with poor story telling and showing mysterious ghost characters in an instant."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is actually pretty good.It's no CoD 4,but it's still decent enough to make rank in my top 3 fav CoDs.The storyline is way better this time around.Gameplay is a bit better,but the only issue I have is the multiplayer maps are TOO big and the new unlock system is kinda weird."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is different from all others Call of Duty. It test the skills of players in adopting new style of gameplays. If you love the style of Black Ops 2 (Tight-â™¥â™¥â™¥ Map, SMG hip-fire) then Ghosts probably won't be a fit for you.   But if you are a CoD 4 Veteran, who plays with ProMod back then all the time, i definitely recommended Ghosts. It requires tactical thinking because you can't rely on the gun skills to win most of the gunfight all the time. This game is in your favor if you outsmart the guy, not how much you better than the others in guns skills. Almost all Call of Duty Ghosts maps are like Call of Duty 4's Bog, wide open, huge with blind spots.   There are a few technical problems here and there, but after the 1.3 patch, most of the problems were ironed out, the game is running steady. As long as you meet the requirement, you should be good to go.   PS: There are no shotage of people who blame lags and can't be brave enough to admit that the others outsmart them. Like hundred of people who are trying to say that right now to this review."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Some lag issues. With tweaked settings you can smooth this game up a bit. Clan wars is kinda cool but you have to able to play soft and hardcore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Kind Of Bad Quality For My Pc When I Have The Best Graphics Settings?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun game. All you gotta do is go to squads and play those and have fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game if they would just get rid of the laggg!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game made me sad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice game the best of all call of duty love it ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,new to the franchise...aaaand i'm gone. bye money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign was interesting and entertaining, it was definately a different feeling from the other games in the series. 8/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's Call of Duty what's not to like and it just keeps getting better and better. Rock On!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think its good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome storyline and gameplay!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Stop hating on this game, if you are you're probably just lack skill or initiative. Its in every aspect more advanced that the previous ones and encorporates some of the enjoyable features and gameplay from MW3! Multiplayer is great, but for once I can actually remember the first mission in the campaign as opposed to it being utter droll."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What can I say about Call of Duty Ghost? I really like the story single player, but the multiplayer is different Story. Sorry for using this word I donâ€™t â€œlikeâ€ it. Compare Call of Duty 4 and even Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. I heard many people hating Modern Warfare 3 for numerous reasons. However I prefer Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 over Ghost maybe, because I am the casual gamer. I canâ€™t seem get pass the guard dog kill streak. No more calling in choppers or predator missiles.  Also I prefer the Disneyland ride instead than giving me full control of the aircraft my guess is Infinity Ward is trying to copy Battlefield, but even Battlefield 2 which is old as HELL is way much more fun to control jet and helicopter, than the satellite or small little chopper in Call of Duty Ghost both Single Player &amp; Multiplayer.  The only kill streak I seem to like so far is from the support class. Where you respawn in little helicopter and you help out your team by providing sniper cover, because that concept appears in many war films.  Final Overall score 7/10  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty is back with a new twist on the future of warfare, where dogs truly are your best friend. Both in single player missions and multiplayer matches. I highly recommend this game for anyone that loved the 'realism' of the modern warfare series. Squads and extinction are new game modes; squads replacing spec ops/combat training, and extinction replacing zombies/survival mode."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer isn't as fun as Black Ops 2 but it's growing on me. The single player campaign however is excellent and is not tied to any previous COD characters, which makes it very entertaining. COD campaings have always been fun, (much better than Battlefield IMO), and this one is so far the best."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a very good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's really nice game, nice graphics, gameplay, plot and gaming. It was pleasure to play it. :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I hate call of duty so who am I to judge. Wait a minute if I hate COD then why do I play it. 9/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really great game and recommended
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cool game and nice multiplayer maps
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible but i can have snoop dogg commentate my mass murder spree  10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"one of the best games on steam, but like every cod game on here, its also dead, with only a couple of tdm lobbys.  got good controller support, feels smooth, i havnt got anything bad to say about it apart from the hackers that cod always gets. but in my opinion people are strange as this game works great and yet people would sooner moan about it then go play a rubbish over rated, clunky game like csgo, which i found to be as over rated as minecraft"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer is amazing. Please buy it if you love the storyline and enjoy playing campaign. DO NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER!! BLACK OPS 2 IS BETTER IN TERMS OF GRAPHICS AND ACTUAL GAMEPLAY THAN THIS!!!  For the 30 hours i spent replaying the campaign on veteran, I must say for the $60 pricetag it isnt all that bad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I haven't played this game since its release. All it does is crash and freeze. It freezes on my computer, my friends' computers. This is a console game through and through. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Everyone is entitled to there game of choice so if you do not like COD you know what to do... Game On!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a nice shooter game and it makes fun to play it.The games are very nice and the graphics are qiet good I think .``
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very cool story mode! i really liked the story. and the multiplayer is prettynice :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is probably one of the best campaigns of call of duty ive ever played. Thats honestly the only reason why I even bought the game. I havent even bothered with multiplayer because I heard that it just sucks so if your going to buy this game, buy it for the campaigne. The graphics are fantastic and I give the overall gameplay a solid 8/10.   P.S. buy this game off amazon if you want to save like $40 bucks, its only like $22 USD ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game isn't as bad as I was expecting, but from a Next-Gen Launch Title perspective it sucks. The optimization isn't so good, but there's now an FoV changer. This game is surprisingly more stable than Advanced Warfare. Also has some weird DLC, like a Snoop Dogg announcer and Weed Camo. If you just want a simple Run-and-Gun game with Okay (For 2011) Graphics and a Stupid Campaign, this one's for you.  3/5 'Average'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It may be a bit of more of the same games as before, but I like the kind of multiplayer found in CoD series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hard 'Ghost - Gameplay '. =)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,0/10  they lied to their customers.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc port. need 6gb ram when only uses 2gh to run.   i want my cash back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very best  beautiful game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,s'aight
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great storieline for a COD game. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS: + Gameplay + Graphics + Ability to practice with bots  CONS: - Poor performance - Bugs and crashes - Lack of innovation - Short, 'on-rails', clichÃ©-ridden campaign - Multiplayer matchmaking system, lack of dedicated servers - Small, poorly designed maps - Unbalanced - Paid map packs Review : 2/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst game i have ever purchased, if i could turn back the time i would! graphics are so bad for a game claimed to be 'next-gen' even if its new there are soo many lags, crashes, poor frame optimize this is exactly a copy paste of modern warfare 3.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well executed single-player and a well executed multi-player. There are few games out there that offer these kinds of thrills and spills. Only reason its not a 9 is the lack of optimisation for the PC version and bugs which persist 10 days post release; that said the PC version is the best looking of all of the versions (of course). Suspect the negative reviews don't reflect reality for PC gamers.  Its Fun, its big.. and its worth the dosh."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,VAC banned me for no reason and i really want my game back.. You should at least be happy that someone realy likes your gam.. so please unbanned me.. please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible but i can have snoop dogg commentate my mass murder spree  10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,still better than Advanced Warfare...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is amazing 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,love the game especially the new maps. def a game to have

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best Of The Past COD'S! I've been playing COD since #2 and must say this one offers the most versitle range of missions ever. Besides this it puts the player into the game with realistic actions active av. The missions are intense most realistic war sim i've ever played. A must have if you are a mission based COD Junky like me. I haven't played much multiplayer so I can not comment on it. Don't know why this game got such a bad name. I can still recall being introduced to Ghost back in Modern Warfare 2. Few missions tipped the player off as what was brewing in the future. I love Ghosts best in series. Also played COD Black Ops 1-2 but still return to the COD Advanced Warfare Series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's Call of Duty... don't be surprised. Many have begun ripping into the Call of Duty franchise for their lack of originality. I suppose one could make that argument, but I think they would be missing the point.   I've never looked upon the Call of Duty franchise as a game, at least not a regular FPS. I enjoy Call of Duty for one simple reason, it's an experience. Period. It's about 6 to 8 hours of interactive movie making whereby you are along for the ride in typically fantastic, far from reality, scenes of epics battles where even the action will slow down and wait for you should you decide to stroll off to the side somewhere. Not to worry, they'll call you back soon enough.  I had some optimisation issues, but my rig has begun showing its age, so maybe just me. Otherwise, graphics - solid, controls - solid, sound - fantastic, voice - good.  In the end, if you're in the mood for an intereactive cinematic gameplay rush. This game is for you. If you're looking for a cutting edge FPS, keep on walkin' soldier. I liked it for what it is, an experience!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its pretty amazing...bcs it is better than the newer cod like black ops 2 if your not into high tech stuff..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome Game. I love you Call Of Duty ^^ 10/10 (Y) 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good Game 3/5 but too expensive
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Stop it all you haters. I see so many bad reviews on this game, and so many of them say things like 'same old game re-hashed'.  Well, just how many things can you do in a FPS? The Ghosts campaign takes you underwater to fight sharks, in space, in cities, in the countryside, etc. Just how many localities are there anyway?  Here is my take on the game:  Campaign is about what I expected. Yeah it's cut and paste, but like I said, there are only so many things you can do in a FPS campaign. I enjoyed it for what it is to me - a small part of a game that I really bought for multiplayer.  The game does have 2 major flaws, no dedicated servers and poor optimization. I have a good computer, so the second is not a problem. So my only beef is the no dedicated server part.  I have several hundred hours in the game, and look forward to playing it. Here is my recipe for enjoying the game:  I have 3 friends that play this game. We hook up every Friday night and skype each other. Then one of us creates a game, and the others join. Sometimes we fight each other, some times we team up and fight bots. The other night, we played a game of domination (3 of us that night) against, I think, 15 or so bots on hard. Now that's a tough game. Search and destroy against a bunch of bots, or maybe one of us and some bots (we bid on the number) against the rest of us. Sometimes we do knife only fights, or one of us will camp, while the others try to dig him out. I could go on, but you can see the possibilites are almost endless.  We have a ton of fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty aids mp but the campaign was well worth it dont spend anymore than 10bucks on this cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lame, way over the top storyline and unlikeable characters, plus a few pc optimisation issues (you'll need a decent PC and card), but still some moments of awesomeness in this decent FPS. The parts of this game on the space station were very new and interesting. Overall, worth a sale buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game. Not sure why its so unpopular. Love extinction, like zombies but with aliens. Love the idea behind extinction with escaping from maps etc. Love the multiplayer. Gutted there arent more players"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,after a long time of having this game i am now able to play it just fine. for some reason this game didn;t like the gtx 480 in sli but the gtx 970 loves this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Story Line. Graphics need work but its good, a patch for lag is recommended. Besides all the mistakes and glitches I LOVE this game. No Regrets getting it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"10/10 Gave it to a friend, he punched me down."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Since there has been so many CoD games out in the past 5 years, it does get annoying but i would recomend if youre into intense FPS games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no plz no  give me my money back
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ram req etc. stupid flying papers lol good game 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A lot of people hated this game. I have to say, when it comes to Call of Duty, you have to keep an open mind. I think Ghosts is a GREAT addition to the Call of Duty lineup. I play it on Xbox 360 mainly but got PC to join other friends. Weapons are awesome, maps are various (some for snipers, some for CQB)   If you can, get this game and the season pass. I am starting my collection of COD on PC, I have the entire series for Xbox, 360 &amp; One."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"very fun game to play, still some bugs like the drill still wants to embed itself in a character, and even when I have keep weapon accessories, it sometimes doesn't keep them, along with not be captured, I have that checked on additional skills and I still get captured by the cryptids"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun just like all the other CoD games, except Black Ops 1, die forever, but anyway...  Story is pretty cool, I like how its home in the US, but at the same time a global struggle. Gameplay is nice and tight as I would expect. Game plays very smooth. Multiplayer is pretty much the same ol fast paced run and gun which is nice if you are into that kinda gameplay.  I like the app that you can get and be able to use it with clans, check your stats, get in game reward bonus's.  I'd recommend this game as I recomend most CoD games. Its simple, fast paced, fun to hop in for a few quick games and go do other things.  Enter the trolls that have nothing better to do...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,only got for single player while on sale . was quite good . had no problems with frame rates etc . as was not trying on run at highest settings
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You know alot of people were like oh dont buy that game it totally blows. But I have played for a few hours no problems and its not a bad game little short as most CODs are nowadays but so far decent game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player of many of the Call of Duty franchise never ceases to amaze, shock and explode it's way through action and intensity, and Ghosts does just that again and lives up to it's good reputation of great campaigns. I delved in not knowing much about what was going or knowing the origin of why things were happening. However I soon found myself immerssed into the story.  The story follows mainly around Logan, as he trains up ready to join the Ghosts towards the start of the game and continuing the missions alonside with your brother and your father. Not to mention, quite a new feature was that they added a loveable npc/character - Riley. He's a great attack dog who helps alongside a few missions, although dissapointingly you only get to use him in a couple of missions and that's it. I felt a great amount of companionship with this animal in the game as well as the companionship of the other soldiers.   The missions during the game can be very intense and are jam-packed full of action (who doesn't love that?!). This game has seen some bad and harshly critical feedback (maybe more so towards the multiplayer) But honestly, I loved the campaign from start to finish, with only a couple of times me feeling annoying at some parts of a mission that didn't make sense what to do (I.e the penultimate mission)  The visuals are stunning, the sounds are intense, the story is gripping and the gameplay is.. well honestly no different to most of it's predecessors - yet still the campaign was fantastic - and I'd highly advise to keep watching the credits through... (you know, like Marvel movies do? With that little twist or added clip at the end!)  I would highly recommend this game to fans of the CoD series, for those who want a fairly interesting and gripping single player game full of action and high octane gameplay. But honestly - this game is not worth the full price of Â£40/$50. You'd be wise to pick this game up cheap on a sale or reduced price!  I rate this game (having played also the multiplayer and extinction mode): 7.6 / 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's ok
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"taught me how to 420 quiksc0pe  also, dogs"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really fun!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Singleplayer 7/10  Multiplayer 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LIKE IT ALOT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its Good. Kinda made me Disappointed because you can't play as the Main Chararcter from Campaign.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Actually not as bad as people would like to make you believe.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice game but rly bad engine
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game play now that they've added the FOV slider. Love the weapons and diversity of the maps. Private matches against the bots are also a bonus as they provide a way to test out the weapons and their characteristics. Two thumbs up!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothings bad about it to me. Hit detection is good. (new aswell), Guns good, extinction good. Why all the hate? I kniw there is some bad stuff about it, like the maps being big unlike other COD maps but its good. And the campain, OMG its good! Recomend this game coz its just like any COD game. P.S. I HAVE played other COD games, like BO2, WAW, BO, MW, etc but on my cousins (Shurikenz) PS3."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome, defenetly worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's fun, but don't get too attached."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very nice from Kazhakstan 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very short, but epic kampagne (5 hours)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,would be better if more people played multiplayer but still a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not Bad at all...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing COD game on PC I have played on in a while. Feels good getting back into COD. Lol jokes. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that.. Average game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Quite an expensive game for such a short story. Still a good filler game though . .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"one off the best of call of duty, i like all the games call of duty, you guys keep coming with more your the best a friend the brickman P.R."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its BAJS JUST TEST IT I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a vanilla FPS game what more is there to say
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very fine game recommend 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lets be honest i play against bots and get my friends on skype to pretend im playing other people and ill tell you why   so a frosty october morning i decided to playing CoD ghosts so after 10 min of loading a match i was in ready to stomp some noobs now i had my wish i had just final kill camed a 10 year old that wanted to talk â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so i came back with 'me and your dead sister used to play this before â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing' and he started to cry and then got his mom on mic and she began to yell at me....now yes i thought it was funny so i said show me your boobies and ill say sorry to later relize it wasnt his mom but his moms lesbion lover   10000/10-getting yelled at by a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty fun game, but don't expect it to be populated. This game isn't as old as MW2, but it has around the same population. Also be careful as like the other cod games made after this have some type of blurry vision so be sure to turn off depth of field and whatever else is on to help see. ALSO, IF YOUR NAT IS STRICT, WELL THEN THIS GAME CAN MAKE IT OPEN. I remember when mw2 could change nat from strict to open, but since that system is broken, you can buy this game and just use it to get open nat ;) Not much hours since campaign isn't really a thing, but it is pretty action movie like. Smooth movement, it feels good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer: run and gun...meh. Fun for a few hours, but meh, better community than AW. Single Player: So damn awesome, but the story is sort of short. Yes I reccomend this title!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a good game however, the community is dead showing less than 1,000 people playing this game globally.  I have played many hours on my other account to know that this game is dead. However, still meets my levels of expectation."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,only if you like choppy first person shooters and the creators had their collective heads where it don't shine. Your signles to do some of the actions have alot to be desired. Really 'F' with a broken circle and a hand in the middle are you kidding. Now how the hell is anyone supposed to figure that one out. I give it 2 ralfs for stupidity.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I had the game for a long time, and only upgraded a few months later, and only then could I play online. With so few players as it was, co-op was a no-go. If you're expecting a good game, you can't go wrong with Ghosts, actually quite a solid game IMO. If you're expecting an active player base, you will be sorely dissapointed, but definitely go ahead if you and your friend will play it, I'd also be happy to reinstall and be player 3."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player campain: like most of the Call of Duty games, it's alright. the story is lame, but you can follow it. the game play is about the same as other CoD titles. you have your standard point and shoot, your choice to shoot or sneak around, you have underwater missions, space missions and you have dog missions where you control a trained dog.    Multi-player: this is where the games lacks in some areas and is awesome in other areas.  I tried to play 'Free for All' multi payer with real people on the net, well I was put in a room with players of my skill level. I was at level 1 the others were level 14, level 20 something, and level 40,,yeah my level players. i wont be wasting much of my time playing these.  you do NOT get to choose your room. you do NOT get to choose your map. you do NOT get to choose your side.  like all of the Call of Duty games since modern warfare 2 you get forced into a server that you may or may not want. if you leave the room and think you can enter a diferent room, think again you will be put right back in the same room.   I do like the private multiplayer option. there i get to pick my type of game play, the map i wish to play, the number of bots i want for enemies the level of the bots, and i can also pick the number of friendly bots and their level, if i play team deathmatch.  in the private multiplayer area, there are quite a few maps. some are very large and small maps as well. you can set up to 17 bots to play during your session. that leaves you and up to 17 others in the map. small maps i like to set the player numbers to about 8 max. either 4 for each team ot me against 7 bots.  but don't be fooled, the multi-player games are all 'run and gun', there is not much time for camping. you stop for a second or two to catch your breath and bam there is an enemy.  all in all the game is NOT worth paying $60 for, but I got my copy for 1/3 of that. it's worth $20, but I wouldn't pay anything more for it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty aids mp but the campaign was well worth it dont spend anymore than 10bucks on this cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"best game ever. Can't believe how good it is, played so much and is just perfect. Good Job COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awsome game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"campers, campers everywhere  10/10 would buy an RV"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS IS COD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you should buy this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,great game and good graphics...with my gpu hd7970 i apply all setting graphics on ultra (no fur dynamic) with resolution fullhd and i get 60fps almost always good multiplayer and nice coop alien invaders i just started single player but the story is interesting :D  at the right price is good deal
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is very good! I can't understand why most people here believe it's a failure! Seriously, there is nothing wrong with this game. I don't know what probelms you had/have with the game, but i didn't get any problems at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game i remember when i got it i was very happy i don't know why people hate it so much not gonna lie the PC version is not the best but i enjoy it i also play this on the PS3 and i love it! i am not to much of MP player on PC i play SP on PC and SP and MP on PS3. sure this game wasn't the best CoD but i think it could have of gotten better reviews if people gave it a chance (You will now start a war in the comments) i prefer this game over Advanced Warfare for sure i stil love AW but it has it's problems i give ghost 7.5/10. All the weapons are to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing over powered, most of the maps are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the other major problem for me is that to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing prestige you need those 'Squad Points' to unlock a loadout and each loadout can prestige once that idea was just awful, as i was saying i like this game a lot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awesome graphics and gameplay. SO real, so amazing! I lOve it!!! best FPS ever!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,In my opinion this is the last ok call of duty. They are just getting soooooo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of COD. 0/10 would buy again. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ midfuture FPS with copy-pasted gameplay. Ohhh, but aliens!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes i love this game and i recommend to all people...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can I buy more xp in the shop for perks n stuff and How?? 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game rules by my opinion. I really love this game .. But I hate when somebody camps .. It's gettin bored then .. but it's a part of this game w/e.. But I love it really and the single player campaign ... I loved it so much .. Really great story .. I like it and I can't wait for beginning of the campaign in another series of Call of Duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i loved the game i whant more

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better than Call Of Duty Advanced.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Singleplayer is pretty nice and clean. However multiplayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I loved this chapter of the COD franchise - it was everything a FPS looks for in a game, the only drawbacks, as I see it, was the story was too short for solo play and you are a bit limited in choice of loadout. The actual story is great, well thought out and plot fully developed. I think the graphics were great - I never play online, so I crank the graphics settings all the way up, have a good computer to handle the demands - the effects are great. Out of all the characters developed for this game, and there are plenty that are very well done, Riley was my favorite - the addition of a K-9 was a great touch. Having served in Iraq, I think adding a K-9 was a great touch and added depth and some real world elements no other games have brought to the table the same way. All the way around, Ghosts is a great addition to the CoD line - but has the strength to stand on it's own."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"IMPORTANT!: If you were planning to buy this game running a duel core i3/pentium etc. DO NOT!!! The game lags uncontrollably due to frame drops! I have now got an i5 3570k from my old i3 2120, it runs smooth! Love this game. Servers are terrible though! Don't bother trying to find any other game apart from strikezone 24/7 which personally I am fine with but I guess thats my opinion. I would recommend this game if you are on a decent pc/laptop (But duel core is being outdated easily now! (gta 5, gta 4, far cry 4 etc) and someone ok with setting up private game to play things like gun game etc. Anyway this is a good game but not the best cod! :) I got code for 6 pound 99 from ebay. I wouldn't spend $40 on this even if I had the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D::D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great action game. COD Ghosts 2 doesnt compare.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,VERY GooD GaMe with a lot of Cheaters 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Although there are lots of error on system, worthy to play some because of nice graphic"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After first enjoying CoD: Modern Warfare 1-3, and then suffering through the horror that was CoD:BlOps 1-2, I came to Ghosts expecting the worst. Thankfully, it wasn't so bad at all.  The storyline isn't quiiiiite up there with Modern Warfare IMHO, but that's mainly because the premise is more than a little far-fetched. I'll just say that while the game is set at some indeterminate point in the somewhat-near future, it seems geopolitics have changed way more than the, uh, tools of final diplomacy. That's guns. I'm talking about guns.  Anyway, if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, the plot is pretty decent. In addition, the game mechanics are an enormous improvement on Codblops. From the very beginning, and sporadically throughout the game, you're even treated to fun and innovative ways to burninate your enemies, like space combat, non-ridiculous helicopter combat (codblops, I'm looking at you...), and drone remote control. Fun!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game you Just need a beefy computer. &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,'Press G to throw back Grenade' Simulator 2k13 if you play Single-Player Multiplayer is pretty garbo. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only 600-700 People playing in Europe, If you get in a game with hackers, then good luck getting to a different Lobby. You can only play TDM and if you wait alot then FFA, Domination and some other modes, No S&amp;D, Gun Game, Infection or anything like that. Might run into FPS Problems. But overall gameplay is fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome Game I Like It But Only Problem Is less People And Cant Play Few Gamemodes Cus Of less Players
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is got a gad dog whoez naem waz Riley. What happen is sad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is another Call of Duty game before the next one comes out in the very near future. for anyone or COD fans, just get this while on sale.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly don't understand the bad reviews on this game. Is it because NA got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up? Or because you had to play some missons as a dog?  The gameplay and graphics are good, I mean, it's the same engine for over a decade...  The story is okay, it could be better yes. But still has some nice action moments.  Anyway, I recommend this game. 8/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I enjoy this game, i really do, and i like the new perk system. but listening to GyStg Ermey yell at me and tell me how much i suck just made this game the best cod ever!!!!!! SO MUCH BETTER THEN BLACK OPS 3!!!!   infinity/999999999999999999999999999999"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of duty ghosts is a war simuulation/ fps that I enjiy overall.  Pros: Realistic war simulation Lots of content Great graphics not infinite warfare  Cons: No boobs 'Buy Call of Duty: Ghosts - Season Pass Check out the Call of Duty: Ghosts - Season Pass game page to learn more Realsitic loading screen simulator  Overall a 7.5/10 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was alot of fun for me. It's CoD if you don't like CoDs formula then you won't like this. It's just a fun run and gun game, the story is stupid to the point it's like an 80s action movie. The multiplayer is alot of fun to play with friends. It's not well optimized though I found, my friend and I had a bit of trouble running it (Multiplayer in particular). But it's fun, my friend and I played through this together and the glitches were hilarious (No game breaking ones just physics glitches) If you like CoD, B-Rate movies and the occasionall hilarity then you'll like Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This CoD has the best bots.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, takes a little to level up though"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"like i bought the previous COD's for the zombies gamemode, i bought this game for the alien gamemode and it does not dissapoint at all :D"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great campain 10/10 Multiplayer 7/10 DLCS 9/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome game worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wanted to buy mw3 but i bought this by mistake.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best single player in all of the call of dutys!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unfortunately, because of recent CoDs and re-playing this game, it seems that this CoD is actually pretty decent. I think this is probably one of the higher-end CoDs, especially compared to the newer â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like BO3, which was a horrible game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just to be clear - My review is only about the single player campaign (SPC). I don't play any multiplayer at all. I don't care about it. For me, it's all about what drives the story.  And the SPC is freaking awesome. I have zero idea why this game gets so much hate. It is a great thrill ride. You get to play both as a soldier and an attack dog. You have your run-and-gun sections and more stealthy ones. You avoid a Venezuelan hit squad in the jungle, infiltrate a high riser, escape on a zipline, be on a tank, attack helicopter, scuba diver, a shootout in space and that's only a partial list. Hell, you even get to avoid getting killed while carrying your injured attack dog to safety. That part really got to me. I love dogs, and this one sounds exactly like a real live one, so throughout the game, I really started caring about it a lot.  The conversations sound authentic. The mood the story sets is great. Production values are excellent. I particularly enjoyed the 'kill silently' parts. It really made it feel like I'm in a real life spec op squad.  Again - I can't comment on multiplayer. For me, multiplayer in a shooter is pointless, but the SPC is HIGHLY recommended."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty cool game. Limited in it's scope, not much room to move around and the spawn points are easy to camp. If you're looking for fast resets and quick games this is it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Super invincible warzone dog rescue simulator. Now with +100% added cheese factor. Oo-rah!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game play now that they've added the FOV slider. Love the weapons and diversity of the maps. Private matches against the bots are also a bonus as they provide a way to test out the weapons and their characteristics. Two thumbs up!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is very good! I can't understand why most people here believe it's a failure! Seriously, there is nothing wrong with this game. I don't know what probelms you had/have with the game, but i didn't get any problems at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game i remember when i got it i was very happy i don't know why people hate it so much not gonna lie the PC version is not the best but i enjoy it i also play this on the PS3 and i love it! i am not to much of MP player on PC i play SP on PC and SP and MP on PS3. sure this game wasn't the best CoD but i think it could have of gotten better reviews if people gave it a chance (You will now start a war in the comments) i prefer this game over Advanced Warfare for sure i stil love AW but it has it's problems i give ghost 7.5/10. All the weapons are to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing over powered, most of the maps are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the other major problem for me is that to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing prestige you need those 'Squad Points' to unlock a loadout and each loadout can prestige once that idea was just awful, as i was saying i like this game a lot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player campaign is a wild ride despite its underwhelming storyline and short play through while the multiplayer aspects of the game take the cake and raise the franchise to even higher heights. It's jam packed with all sorts of new content from an engaging squads mode, a hectic Extinction mode and a new slate of multiplayer features to keep the core Call of Duty gamers playing for hours on end"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game i have no idea what all the sooking is about!!! die quickly? real life die your dead !! get over it . Get a tissue if you dont like to be killed  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,make the dlcs free now i mean c'mon its over 3 or 2 years....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best editions to the COD series
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THIS GAME ITS BETTER THAN BO2 ITS SO LIKE MW2 :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought it for 5$ from a local electronics store 10/10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty ghosts multiplayers is good, i like the classic play but with afew new things added, it has good killstreaks but some feel weak, especially when you're trying to get as much kills as possible, Squads mode is also very good i enjoy the team feel, the Multiplayer doesn't have that aspect to it, all around the maps are quite large and good, it does take quite some time to find people on a team death match on the larger maps, the guns are good and equal, but there will always be one or two overpowered ones everyone is attracted too, the game is good all around, a nice 9/10 for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have not played online with this game...But I think the main story is okay. it's a little short though. I finished it in 6.5 hours and I was in no hurry!!!. So a little short for me.  Also for some reason this game is very CPU heavy, which makes the game lag from time to time, and my machine is more than powerfull enough to run this game. but I have seen a lot having this problem when I seached the inter-web.  I finished the game missing more from the game... at least from the single player part. No big battles... just a quickie!! I will recomend it... it's okay. But wait until it's on sale. ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME &lt;3 MY FAVOURITE! BEST COD I'VE EVER PLAYED !!! 11/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's a good game :) It's worth about 6 euros i think not 30 euros... 10/7 ;) awesome multiplayer but bad campaign :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not many players online, but i like the game :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fun while it lasted. The lack of players made multiplayer useless. Overall it was a good game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks would not recomending u bguys buying this the spawn sucks die way to fast on regular mode and not to many wepon choices
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BEst recent Hardcore Multiplayer (including Advanced Warfare and Black ops 3)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a very nice game !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only 600-700 People playing in Europe, If you get in a game with hackers, then good luck getting to a different Lobby. You can only play TDM and if you wait alot then FFA, Domination and some other modes, No S&amp;D, Gun Game, Infection or anything like that. Might run into FPS Problems. But overall gameplay is fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After first enjoying CoD: Modern Warfare 1-3, and then suffering through the horror that was CoD:BlOps 1-2, I came to Ghosts expecting the worst. Thankfully, it wasn't so bad at all.  The storyline isn't quiiiiite up there with Modern Warfare IMHO, but that's mainly because the premise is more than a little far-fetched. I'll just say that while the game is set at some indeterminate point in the somewhat-near future, it seems geopolitics have changed way more than the, uh, tools of final diplomacy. That's guns. I'm talking about guns.  Anyway, if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, the plot is pretty decent. In addition, the game mechanics are an enormous improvement on Codblops. From the very beginning, and sporadically throughout the game, you're even treated to fun and innovative ways to burninate your enemies, like space combat, non-ridiculous helicopter combat (codblops, I'm looking at you...), and drone remote control. Fun!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"May not be the most memorable Call of Duty of all time, but still Ghosts gave me some emotions and some feelings that none of the other CODs gave me. 7.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game you Just need a beefy computer. &lt;3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,'Press G to throw back Grenade' Simulator 2k13 if you play Single-Player Multiplayer is pretty garbo. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sp is good /// mp with bots ok /// mp pvp bugy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BIG waste of money!!! -10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"can not open, when i enter the game. the game stop suddenly after loading screan, please help me"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,At this point either you like COD or you don't this is a great COD game but again if you dont like the formula this wont change your mind.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when is the release of the new dlc? 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice fast pace action game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i liked it screw those guys who hate it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,U can spend mutch time in this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nice shooter. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i only paid 3 bucks for this game on ebay so its litt
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I like the game and the Dog is the best :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fantastic game when it runs. I have two other friends that have the same problem on pc's. The game starts and it'll go for 5 minutes or 30 minutes then it shuts down. I get a ' Disc read errow 'imagefile-40' and can't find any fix online that works, if your're playing it on a game console my son says that it works great, if you're a PC'er like us don't waste your oney.  Updte: I removed my steam account and all of the games I was hoarding. I then installed Steam and loaded only Ghost and the multiplayer version. Now it sems to run fine. Why hasn't anybody else posted this simple fix 'You don't have enough mermory to run it dummy' Would have saved me a lot of grief. Hope this helps someone else with the Error when running Ghost."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game was great on Win 7 - the colors and details were fantastic - if you had a good graphics card. But even with a high end PC if you have Windows 10 - don't buy it. All it does is crash on my PC. My PC's specs are way past recommended and the game still crashes at every map change.  Even before Win 10 the game was not as smooth as it should have been - a little too jumpy, low FPS. Aside from low FPS the single player game was well thought out, and fun to play (on Win 7). The multiplayer maps were loads of fun - and again I found myself amazed at the incredible graphics. Much prettier than BF4...not near as smooth - even with the settings turned down. Incidently for me the game does not crash in multi-player, just single player campaign.  I hope a patch is released, otherwise Win 10 has made this game 'end of life'.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its fine man stop hating on it not worse than any other cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game   i have 7 call of duty   my frist call of duty is black ops 2 n ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nice fast pace action game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yes i love this game and i recommend to all people...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 best shooter of the year !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i liked it screw those guys who hate it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I QUIT. i refuse to buy anymore black opps games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is very fun. Graphics are great on PC but suck on the consoles. Squads mode is my personal favorite mode. I hope IW brings it back in COD2016 along with better MP. Ghosts was hated i think because the graphics on Consols sucked and MP had a very low Time To Kill. You die in like 2-3 shots. I personally like this but some dont.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,that's the best game ever made :D
Call of Duty: Ghosts,best $8 i spent on a game at walmart :P
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"*Call of Duty Ghosts is very different from the other CODs. Campaign is really cool.You have a guard dog(Riley) to protect you in some missions you can send him to take down enemies. *Multiplayer is a bit weird because perks are too many.But there are a lot killstreaks to choose from.Guard dog,squad member,ODIN-LOKY(Satellites),Heli scout and much more.You can also customize your squad characters. *Extinctions is a blast.Rank up,choose your loadout,create your soldier (like in multiplayer) and take down these nasty aliens. *Squads is something that makes a difference in COD Ghosts.You can customize your team's characters,rank them up and choose their loadouts.  Campain - 9/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 Squads - 9/10 Extinction - 7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD:Ghosts is your average CoD with a slightly better campaign and a slightly worse multiplayer. Let's ditch the obvious first : the graphics are okay, but not breathtaking and absolutely not optimized. The sound does its job, and the gameplay consists in clicking on heads. Woaaaah.  I have a particular affection for this game's campaign. The story avoids the usual trap of being more complex than the game does really need,and that's really for the better. You know what you fight for, something that was not that obvious in some previous entries. The emphasis on the variety of situations is welcome as well. Space is love, space is life. But what retained my attention is a very particular (if not unexpected) twist that would be criminal to spoil here. To me, it simply flet that, for the first time in the whole series, an episode tried to tell its story using specific game-design mechanics. That twist is the only reason I'll actually remember the game. And to be honest, I tend to forget CoD's campaigns as soon as they are over.  What kills the multiplayer are the maps. They're too big. CoD is about frenetic close-combat. Game Over. The zombies/aliens mode is fun tho. Nice try, but not enough to my taste to compensate for the failed deathmatch.  At its actual price, this game is not worth a buy, the campaign being short and the multiplayer boring. For ten bucks or less tho, it makes two enjoyable afternoons, which can't be spitted over.  4/10 as of today (19/08/2016) 7/10 if the price is 10 bucks or less or if you're only interested in the campaign and ready to buy it whatever the price"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was alot of fun for me. It's CoD if you don't like CoDs formula then you won't like this. It's just a fun run and gun game, the story is stupid to the point it's like an 80s action movie. The multiplayer is alot of fun to play with friends. It's not well optimized though I found, my friend and I had a bit of trouble running it (Multiplayer in particular). But it's fun, my friend and I played through this together and the glitches were hilarious (No game breaking ones just physics glitches) If you like CoD, B-Rate movies and the occasionall hilarity then you'll like Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I used to think to think this game was horrible. I thought it was the same as Modern Warfare 3. Then i played Black Ops 3...  In other words, this game is awesome. Sure no one really plays it, but its a hell of a alot better than the future â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that is black ops 3."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good game wish had longer solo play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome game worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A 3 grand pc will play it veryslow so have funn .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great campain 10/10 Multiplayer 7/10 DLCS 9/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A very well written Campaign,which led to most enjoyable game ive had yet in Singleplayer. Hope there will be Ghosts 2 :)  MP Version: Do me a favour,play SP only"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign was good, better than Battlefield 4 (I don't expect a good campaign from BF series). I was immersed in some parts of it. Didn't try the multiplayer (probaly it's dead right now, IDK, I don't expect a good multipayer from CoD series). I didn't pay the full price though, a lot of third-party sites selling it discounted."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unfortunately, because of recent CoDs and re-playing this game, it seems that this CoD is actually pretty decent. I think this is probably one of the higher-end CoDs, especially compared to the newer â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like BO3, which was a horrible game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game. The more horsepower I throw at it, the better it gets. I HATED it when it first came out as is was virtually unplayable. And granted, it shouldn't take this much horsepower to make it awesome, but I'm glad that it has a lot to offer (big maps) and replayability, at least the way I play COD games: Multiplay Bot matches."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,make the dlcs free now i mean c'mon its over 3 or 2 years....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game! The customization and other stuff, the only downfall is the lag alot, so change your settings! Otherwise you won't have a great gaming experience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just to be clear - My review is only about the single player campaign (SPC). I don't play any multiplayer at all. I don't care about it. For me, it's all about what drives the story.  And the SPC is freaking awesome. I have zero idea why this game gets so much hate. It is a great thrill ride. You get to play both as a soldier and an attack dog. You have your run-and-gun sections and more stealthy ones. You avoid a Venezuelan hit squad in the jungle, infiltrate a high riser, escape on a zipline, be on a tank, attack helicopter, scuba diver, a shootout in space and that's only a partial list. Hell, you even get to avoid getting killed while carrying your injured attack dog to safety. That part really got to me. I love dogs, and this one sounds exactly like a real live one, so throughout the game, I really started caring about it a lot.  The conversations sound authentic. The mood the story sets is great. Production values are excellent. I particularly enjoyed the 'kill silently' parts. It really made it feel like I'm in a real life spec op squad.  Again - I can't comment on multiplayer. For me, multiplayer in a shooter is pointless, but the SPC is HIGHLY recommended."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Love the game. One of the better once in CoD.. Do NOT like the fact that the Clan app don't work anymore!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,another COD game imo BO2 was better but oh well to each their own.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Is got a gad dog whoez naem waz Riley. What happen is sad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,uh its ok iguess

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is a really decent game - the only drawback is that the single player campaign seems a little short - but it plays a damned sight better than Black Ops 3 does on my system (and, before you ask, yes, I've changed a lot of settings on blops3 trying to get it to run better - but blops3 was complied and optimized for an I7 processor, and, as such, runs like crap on an I5, which is what I have) "

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Loved the single mode story ! Overall nice game.  8/10 (for me)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok game, maybe a longer story would have been nice tough it has been made as a multiplayer after all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Simply amazing capaign. It is first game I ever played twice /second time on veteran difficulty/. For me great single player experience. Multiplayer si great too. For me way better than BO2.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very nice game i defenetly recomend it! I have been playing it more on ps3 than pc but its realy the same game and even if i got it back in 2013 i still enjoy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I enjoyed every missions on it's SP mode , and online mode would be realy fun if more ppl were playing it , the only reason this game abandoned is because of black ops II ... (realy small community)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"decent singleplayer for heavy sale 8/10, multiplayer dead"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really like Ghosts, I don't know why people say it's the worst CoD. Looks good and runs well even on not so powerful PC. The story is simple but good enough (you're gonna play multiplayer most of the time anyway) and Extiction (like Zombies in Black Ops but with aliens) is a LOT of fun, especially if played in Co-op. The multiplayer is traditional CoD pretty much, but maps are larger. If I absolutely had to say something negative about this game is that it has the well-known CoD formula defects."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love the story, but I don't like the way it is played. I especially don't like the way multiplayer does it's guns. I only play it for the Campaign. I give this a 7/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,  Servers need to be more stable.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better than AW
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is the fourth modern game of Infinity Ward after the first call of duty and call of duty 2.I could called this game as Modern Warfare 4 because have many simillarities with previous MW but has a different name and plot.There are 18 missions in the game and is the longest modern game of Infinity Ward until now.  During this game the player can fight on the sky,on the ground and under the sea.In some missions will have the help of his German Shepherd.  I think that the plot of this game is more interesting than this on Black Ops 2.  Some Countries of south america (Brazil,Venezuela and Chile) will collaborate in the same badge and same name,called themselves as Federations during energy crisis,will grow their economy and will have as target to fight USA and will be the most power union in the world.  For this reason hacked Odin (Orbital Defense Initiative) and bombed some cities of USA.So this is only the beginning.  After these events one legendary millitary force from USA named Ghosts will try to fight this terrorist union.This terrorist union can to say that is similar to 'ISIS' but in the game their basis is in Latin America.  During the events player will learn that the most important adviser of Federations was former member of the Ghosts.  So i believe that this game is very good with an interesting plot and doesn't suffer at any point from Modern Warfare which have won so many awards despite the event that have many haters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lol the story, and that ending.... just like a horror b-movie... But the levels are kinda fun :) 7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Rorke just wanted his friends back :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I loved the game, Honestly it's hard to find some matches but I throrouhly enjoyed the Campaign (Ending is the best) and mainy beautiful screenshot moments. I was never bored and the Multiplayer can be hard to find games but I play it. IAC-2 for life! If your all Multiplayer just go for a different game but if you love campaign just go for this!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really do not understand why this game recieved so negatively, I thought it was great. It had a story that was different from the typical cod game, the gameplay was ADDICTING, and I also have some love for it cause it was my first steam game!  It has flaws, and was never optimized that good, but if you look past that, it is wonderful!  7/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Loved the single mode story ! Overall nice game.  8/10 (for me)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good game but full of campers but what ever its fun with friends dont miss the extinction part  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So this is a decent game it just is dying like other COD's. But still enjoyable.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player campaign took me five hours to beat on Hardened difficulty. To make it simple, if you played the Modern Warfare or the Black Ops series, then you probably won't see too many new things. Alot is just about the same. You can control a dog in the beginning, take control of passing A-10's, drive tanks around at one point, and launch satelitte missiles from orbit. Some neat twists were included, like underwater and space combat. Though in both, the odd control scheme to fight in these unusual terrains were a nuisance. While the storyline was predictable, the ending was something I didn't expect. You'll have to see it to know what I'm talking about.  Overall, fun times, albeit short. Worth $60? Not for the campaign alone. Hell, most of you will buy this solely for the multiplayer anyway. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts, Thoughts:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS: A well blended FPS shooter with fascinating single player campaign and a fast paced multiplayer CONS: Requires RAM and a great computer, poor performance"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not quite an ABSOLUTE waste of money, but mostly funny colored weapons. If you don't run around without a pink camouflaged M14 in this game, you're doing it wrong.  Thanks, this was the last CoD I've ever bought. (Heading to BF3 / 4)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I loved the feeling of being a ghost.  +) Amazing environment change.  +) Thrilling battles.  +) BGM was fantastic.   +) Great choices of weapons.  +) Good scenario.   -) The story was good but there were some major and minor defects of it here and there.  -) Some of the stairs in the early game are blocked a little so you have to jump in order to reach top.  -) I wish there were clear and more abundant ways to refill ammo. Using enemy weapons should be secondary choice.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly don't understand the bad reviews on this game. Is it because NA got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up? Or because you had to play some missons as a dog?  The gameplay and graphics are good, I mean, it's the same engine for over a decade...  The story is okay, it could be better yes. But still has some nice action moments.  Anyway, I recommend this game. 8/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unfortunately, because of recent CoDs and re-playing this game, it seems that this CoD is actually pretty decent. I think this is probably one of the higher-end CoDs, especially compared to the newer â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like BO3, which was a horrible game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better than CoD4: Remastered.  Remastered will have microtransactions and Pay2Win.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its a good Call of Duty game, not the best. Its just need players and price is pretty expensive..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Review 2016 after 1000 hours of multiplayer gameplay  Cons: - FOV resets itself when dog bites you. - No option to turn off that frustrating in-game music. - Expensive DLCs causes lack of players in DLC maps. - Advantage of high quality directional headphones with amplify. - No option to turn off that loud and annoying announcer shouting to my ear. - Player partys, matchmaking system doesnt balance teams in those rounds.  Pros: + Fast map load time, i have just enough time to get more water and take a sip. + Havent seen any cheaters. + Extinction game mode is a fresh change from zombie mode. + Very addicting team deathmatch. + Fast paced adrenaline rushing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Actually it's not as bad as i remember, solid hit detection and it's fun in general. Just get it on your consoles, PC is dead"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good story line
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the best first person shooters! All time classic! plot, graphics, music and a story that i loved!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Rorke just wanted his friends back :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A very good FPS game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awesome game worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,there is some thing wrong with that game it won't let me continue it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very fun Call of Duty game i love Extinction mode which is in no other CoD game so it makes this one unique and fun to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very nice game i defenetly recomend it! I have been playing it more on ps3 than pc but its realy the same game and even if i got it back in 2013 i still enjoy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok game, maybe a longer story would have been nice tough it has been made as a multiplayer after all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Simply amazing capaign. It is first game I ever played twice /second time on veteran difficulty/. For me great single player experience. Multiplayer si great too. For me way better than BO2.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game more than the other CoD games, becouse it has much more meaning to the SNEAKY mechanic. Makes me feel much more clever. Also my favourite weapon of all time: the VKS. Recommend you not give up on this game. Its still great, but the community is dieing. Save this please!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great FPS game. Especially online with its unlock system and coop mode.  Online PVP:  =========  First of all: I dont like games, where u need to wait for a level up to unlock your (in most cases better) weapons. Here you can create your soldier profile and unlock the weapons and items you want by the use of skillpoints from the beginning. You just need to earn skillpoints, additional to the one you got from the beginning. Every soldier profile has to unlock it's weapons for itself. So you can create each one for individual roles - feels like RPG in a light edition.  The devs also included destroyable environments, like a gas station, that changes the map layout.   The only big con here is the fact, the games was downhated from my point of view and therefore lacked a lot of players.  I cannot comprehend their big load of critics, I played a lot of the games, taken from this franchise and this is one of the bests online. But suddenly the player counter online is increasing, maybe cuz of the reveal of Infinite Warfare...   Online-Coop: ==========  The coop mode with its aliens and mission driven gameplay is also good. Most of the time you have to use a drill to destroy some point of interest. But the missions and locations are great. You even have bossfights - one of the greatest can be found on MAYDAY. Each mission needs between 1/2 and 1 hour play time to finish. You can choose between several roles, medic, engineer and two combat guys. This mode also includes an XP system, that allows you to pick up different items / skills e.g. the seeker drone, you know / have seen in Black Ops 2. Beside that, you can unlock different skills, e.g. doing more damage with sniper rifles by collecting special items (called teeths). The mode even gives you the opportunity to pick up collectables on the maps, so you can craft own items.  This mode has a great coop experience and is very entertaininig - especially with friends.   Campaign: ========  The Singleplayer has its CoD moments, but has almost nothing you already saw in MW. The most memorable mission was the infiltration of a snow base, but this one was made really brilliant. The most annoyable part was the control of a tank - feels really crappy...   Pricing: ======  Picked up the Hardened Edition with all necessary DLCs for 15 bucks and it was absolutely worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Review CoD: Ghost in 2016  I bought the game on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for 6,99â‚¬  Where I need to start.. Oh yes, the optimisation.  TECHNICAL ASPECT: ---------------------- The game is bad optimised and you gonna get low fps if you haven't a good configuration; I played the game on my laptop, 4GB ram and 2GB ddr3 of dedicated memory on gpu and even if the game can be launch w/ 4Gb ram, you gonna get freezes, lags,...: I recommand 8Gb, w/ a good graphics card, like w/ 2Gb ddr5 memory.  ---------- MULTIPLAYER: --------------- -&gt; I saw a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the multiplayer, and to be honest he isn't very bad. Sometimes u meet campers, but I don't found hackers. The multiplayer had a great potential but now only 400 people play the game and there is a lot of noobs who plays with shotguns ect. -&gt;The CoD: Ghosts multiplayers isn't bad and you can take good time on it, it's very funny to try all weapons ect.. Even if some noob's â™¥â™¥â™¥ the game.  SOLO: -------------- -&gt; I haven't finish the solo yet, but there is a good story and pretty good effects, can't wait to continue :D  CONCLUSION -------------- CoD Ghost isn't a 'very' bad CoD as my opinion. He suffers of a bad optimisation who stops players who wants buy the game. The multiplayers isn't very good, but I think there's some good time to play on it and solo looks impressive, can't wait to finish him. = Don't buy the game for 60â‚¬, buy it on a website for a little ammount, like 6-7â‚¬  I don't think I gonna stay on this game eternally, but he's good :D  6/10   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its a good Call of Duty game, not the best. Its just need players and price is pretty expensive..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun, what I can play anyway.... I seem to be plagued by a fairly bad bug, where I freeze on a specific mission loading screen, but what I have played is very fun and pretty interesting, better than the Modern Warfare series, almost on par with the Black Ops series. Guns are good, sounds are very nice, graphics are pretty (On the highest settings though) but this bug is seriously hurting its quality. I won't even bother doing a pro/con since I have only played the first 2 missions and a little offline bots. The overall right now is pretty bad at 4.5/10 because of this bug. If I could play the game, it would bump up to 6/10 already, then after finishing the game I can only imagine what it'd be. Only reason I recommend is in hopes you don't suffer the same bug."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,big problems with sound with win 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Actually it's not as bad as i remember, solid hit detection and it's fun in general. Just get it on your consoles, PC is dead"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I liked this game. Most recommended for other Call of Duty games players.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better than CoD4: Remastered.  Remastered will have microtransactions and Pay2Win.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better than the call of duty's released after this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts may not have the atmosphere of WWII COD's but it is great fun, I enjoyed it as much as every non COD game released. I reveled in its pace, story, immersion, action and originality - even the graphics, at 4k, give great delight three years post release (November 2016).  After an hour of play you'll be hooked."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros : great campaign Cons : game crash in SP mode , only Alien mode and squad coop pve  Still love this game 7/10 imo !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For $20, this game is pretty good. A lot of content and a new feel to the series. Multiplayer is extremely different from past games in this franchise.  I'd reccomend it only to Call of Duty lovers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Honnestly enjoyed playing it more than i thought. xoxox why not
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is ok, but the 68 GTX in the live action trailer is an awesome car! But seriously, this game is eh at best, if you can run it and are interested just get it for 20 dollars on sale, anymore seems like a bad deal in my opinion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a really good game especially for the price. It has most of the same features as the newer games and the graphics are pretty good too, as long as you're playing it on a current gen console. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty or someone who wants to get into the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is free weekend. That is still too expensive.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible Performance on PC which makes it allmost unplayable on most Systems. i7 3770k, 770GTX, 16GB Ram and I am averaging 40FPS with Stuttering and Lags."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,absolute trash. i punished myself by removing my testicles for buying this game. god have mercy on my soul
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have always enjoyed Call of Duty. I know most people won't agree with me, but I really like the previous ones. Easy, fast-paced action that were fun and addictive. However, the latest installment, Ghost, is a disaster.  The 'new engine' is actually just a modded version of the old quake engine, and that is far from next gen. Ghost is laggy in multiplayer, even though I have strong internet connection (100mbit/s) and a computer that can handle most new games on high/ultra settings. You can't change your FOV (field of view), which is stupid. Audio settings is also very poor and I can't mix them as I want. Ghost required a stupid amount (6gb) of RAM at lanch to even run the game, for no apparent reason. That has however been reduced to 4gb now.The game looks awful and still doesn't run well, which is a serious problem.  The new maps in multiplayer are a lot bigger then usual. It seems like they have stolen a lot of ideas from Battlefield 3 here. However, the engine isn't made for these big maps, so It runs with quite poor FPS. The bigger maps is also boring, and it's not what Call of Duty is suppose to be. It should be close combat fights, with fun weapons and killstreaks. It's suppose to be a unrealistic but funny shooter. The opposite of Battlefield.  The game is laggy even in the main menu. It's like they haven't even tested the PC version before lanch. Lazy, greedy, moneygrabbing developers, fake advertising and promises is why this game deserves my fail of the year-award.  They haven't put much time into optimizing the game properly for PC, and that is not acceptable for a big studio like Infinity Ward. Instead of buying this buggy,boring and unfinished mess, go pick up Battlefield, CS:GO, or Call of Duty-Black Ops Instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty has been one of, if not the most well known franchise in gaming this past generation and last. The franchise has been in decline quality wise after the release of Modern Warfare - excluding maybe Black Ops 2 - which leads to the release of one of the weakest entries (Both Single Player and Multi Player) in the franchise yet. From the get go, you'll notice this game was built by Infinity Ward on the grounds of pure arrogance. This game is the very definition of 'Bare minimum'.  Call of Duty: Ghosts stars a few protagonists, main one being Logan Walker - and the world they live in after a devastating Orbital Strike after a space station was hijacked. The story follows a special assault squad that go by the name of 'Ghosts' and the brother's entry to said Squad as they fight to take control of the US again.   Safe to say that while I did enjoy the campaign, the game is still very, very bare bones in EVERY area possible. The campaign will run you up to around 4 hours - maybe less if you're more skilled. There is much less variation in this game than in previous Call of Duty titles and the story is kind of... silly.   The visuals are pretty standard Call of Duty, looks worse in some areas than other games - namely environments. Ground and wall textures often look very muddy and really contrast against the character models. There is a large degree of inconsistency with textures all across the game which makes the game look visibly worse than even Black Ops 2 - arguably though, it has better effects, like smoke particles and such. One thing I also have to mention is how lazy the character models are. I've noticed certain colors in textures, or maybe the meshes themselves maybe (?) that are 'invisible' [Note: This is a detail that only those with knowledge with how 3D modeling/texturing work will notice and know what it means.] and you can see the background through the meshes, this is pretty common on the hands or in certain cutscenes on their faces.         Call of Duty: Ghosts&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a huge fan of previous Call of Duty games (in particular the campaigns), CoD Ghosts fell so far from the tree, and this really upset me.  My first worries about the game started when I heard that it was leaving behind the Modern Warfare story-line, a story-line that worked and one that I would pay good money to see continued. I didn't expect the story to be as bad as it turned out thoughâ€¦. â€œGenericâ€ is the perfect word to describe it. The characters in particular were boring and completely clichÃ©. Most of the â€œimportant eventsâ€ I saw coming a mile off so they failed to shock me or feel any form of emotion whatsoever.   The second issue was the overall performance of the game. I cannot believe that Infinity Ward released something so buggy and so broken. There are numerous issues on my system despite being more than capable of running the game on max. The sound regularly distorts into a crackly mess and game lags up every once in a while. To top it all off it Ghosts sometimes COMPLETELY freezes my PC forcing me to restart the whole system. These issues alone made me hate the game.   There were other issues that annoyed me. Who the hell designed the sounds for the weapons? They were absolutely terrible. Every time I pulled the trigger (regardless of which gun) it sounded like I was at a construction site rather than a battlefield. I will add that the overall quality of the SFX was below the standard of the previous games. That was so obvious it made me cringe.   Iâ€™m used to short campaigns from the Call of Duty games, but Ghosts was ridiculously short. The only reason it took me 10+ hours was because I was playing on Veteran difficulty where I was often instantly killed by the AI and their godlike aim. This only made it more annoying than challenging. Each mission (if you could call them missions) lasted around 8 minutes in length. They were over before they had even begun really.   I was just so disappointed with CoD Ghosts that I canâ€™t even find anything that I did enjoy about the game. I have refused to even attempt to play the multiplayer and the extinction mode may salvage something, but I donâ€™t know if I have the will to find out. I expected a worse experience than the Modern Warfare games, but I did expect it to beat the Black Ops series. This is by far the worst CoD game to date so avoid it at all costs. Trust me, it just isn't worth it.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Half finished game , most of the users can't run properly the game without large frames(fps) drop or freezes or crashing. The game was cool the first hours , but the lack of support from Infinity ward ( 2 week for a patch who has changed nothing ) and the inability to run the game with stable fps and the lack of PC features like FOV sliders or ranted dedicated servers makes you to don't want to launch that game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"[SP: 7.2/10, MP: 4.9/10, Extinctionn: 8.0/10]  PC version is a joke ! terrible optimization, ridiculous system requirements, frequent FPS drops, low quality textures.   Singleplayer is ok, but multiplayer is a nightmare. this does not even deserve to compete with Battlefield 4. Extinction shares a lot of the same traits as Zombies, but it's fun.  Not worth your time if you own a previous CoD series already."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game has more   hackers   in it than the NSA.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,My favorite part of this game was deleting it and getting my 26 gigs back. Though it was cool to find out it IS possible to get NEGATIVE frame rate!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST COD GAME EVER, DONT BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Don't have FPS Calibration, don't have dedicated server, not good graphics at all, it looks like more blurry then the other cod games, less customization parts for weapons and muzzle brake looks really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, DONT HAVE THEATRE MODE THAT I NEEDED. so on overall its 4/10 ''DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY''"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Locked FPS  Locked Fov  Engine based off the 20 year old quake engine and not done properly like GoldSrc and Source  Some things are ripped straight from the original 20 year old quake engine  Multiplayer menu is buggy if you have more than 20 friends because it freezes everytime there is a friendslist update  Horrible performence  Rinse and repeat 'modern warfare' campaign with vladimir riskinov blowing up the world with his nukes  Rinse and repeat Create a Class with perks multiplayer  Horrible community  Rinse and repeart survival mode  Default graphics settings arent in native resoloution  Textures look like they're from 2007  Requires hack to change FPS on this 'PC' game  Requires hack to change FOV on this 'PC' game  Clearly developed for consoles and horribly ported to PC.  Fish AI was an actual F*UCKING selling point to this game. FISH AI. What a fuc king joke.  Conclusion: this game is a pile of dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It would be more fun shoving a stick in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and bleeding to death than to play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.  0/10 - Do not buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The good: Not a bad campaign. Some cool missions throughout.  All the negatives:  -S..t visuals for 2013. No physics, no real time destruction. Just reused textures and animations from the previous games in the series. -No F.O.V. slider. Who puts out a f..king fps without one these days? Apparently only these a..holes do. Using one of many f.o.v. changers solved this problem but, now that vac is in place, no more using it under the possibility of being banned for using something the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs should have put in to begin with. -Valve anti cheat. Too little, too late. This should have been implemented right from the start as many legit players left the game after nothing was being done about the rampant cheaters.  Infinity Ward and Activision are content with making subpar s..t because it keeps selling. I had the chance to speak with a few of the testers for this game and asked them 'What the f..k happened?' Their response was, 'We brought up all of the problems that we knew everyone would see and were told by the leads, 'We don't care what others will think about it. We only care that it sells.'   That alone is why I will never buy another game from this scumbag of a studio and why this game gets a big 'No' vote.  Save your money. There are games several years older that are technically superior in every way to this game. Call of Duty is dead on the pc. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After installing 40 GB of garbage, I soon realize that my computer is crying after 40 GB have literally been wasted, I could've spent my $60 on 'books' on 'How to get a better social life' or I could've bribed the crap out of my family saying I am spending my free time on 'education' and 'college'. But no, the series MUST continue and the Call of Doodie fanboys and fangirls must continue to feed the developers money on $15 DLC for 4 maps. This game (and series for that matter) is the reason Trump is a top presidential canidate for the 2016 U.S election. I facepalmed so hard after playing this -- I rearanged the cells and molecules in my brain and finally passed a Math test in my class."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, here we are again: another year, another  Call of Duty , as the saying goes.  This franchise has grown incredibly stale in the past five years or so. Infinity Ward has stuck to the same formula since  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , and as a result, almost everything in  Ghosts  feels dated and unimaginative.  Not that some widely acclaimed aspects of said formula needed any change. For instance, the core gameplay mechanics, such as the  shooting  itself, still feel slick and polished.  But how do you justify a 50-gigabyte installation size and the â€œnext-genâ€ marketing this game received, when it looks barely nicer than stuff that was released in 2007? Itâ€™s not an ugly-looking game, sure, and the textures do look pretty good, despite what some people may say. But comparisons with  Battlefield 4 ,  Metro: Last Light  and other recent titles are inevitable, and the fact remains that everything else in  Ghosts , graphics-wise (lighting, particle effects, physics, etc.), is subpar.  I am not one to judge a game solely on its graphical fidelity, however. The problem with  Ghosts  is that, sans the welcome addition of the ability to practice against bots, it has no redeeming qualities to speak of.  The single-player campaign is short, clichÃ©-ridden and does not give the player any freedom. You just follow scripted orders from your â€œA.I.â€ companions, moving forward when told to and shooting enemies that pop out of hiding (when told to). It doesnâ€™t help that the story is entirely predictable and that the voice-acting is abysmal (and since we're on the subject of audio, what can I say about the game's single, useless 'master volume' slider in the settings menu?).  But most people seem to buy  Call of Duty  games for its multiplayer portion. And it too is a colossal failure. Maps are poorly designed and donâ€™t support more than 18 players (most matches have 12 or less players). The matchmaking system is terrible: teams are completely unbalanced more often than not. There are no dedicated servers, despite Mark Rubinâ€™s (Infinity Wardâ€™s Executive Producer) promises prior to the gameâ€™s release. Teamwork is non-existent, as people just run in circles and shoot each other in the back to get the best possible kill-to-death ratio and unlock ridiculous, balance-breaking â€œkillstreakâ€ bonuses.  Then there is the fact that once again, Activision will charge a good deal of money for upcoming map-packs, since not only is modding unsupported, but frowned upon.  The 'new' Extinction Mode is not even worth discussing. It is basically an uninspired rehash of Treyarch's far superior 'Zombies' horde-mode (from  World at War  and the  Black Ops  series).  To top it all,  Ghosts  suffers from a myriad of technical issues, such as glitches, crashes and framerate drops. And as a sign of Infinity Ward's everlasting 'love' for the PC audience, there is no field-of-view slider of any kind, and a single slider for audio. Individual sliders for music, sound effects and voice communication would be too much to ask, apparently.  The bottom line: donâ€™t buy it.  UPDATE (07/31/2014): I should add that, at this point (almost a year after release), the game has become nothing but a glorified DLC-selling platform, and there's effectively nothing to differentiate it from the dozens of low-quality free-to-play games on the market... except for, you know, the full entry price."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do NOT reccomend this game, nomatter how good you are at CoD. These are the reasons:  1. Worst netcode by date. The faster the connection, the more the delay. People with slow connection apear on your screen with seconds of delay and the most annoying thing is, they do get hitmarkers on you instantly, even if you don't really see them. 2.Bad FPS. It's completeley random honestly, but 2/3 of the hardware gets unplayable FPS, so far GTX 560 Ti and radeon hd 7770 seem to work the best for this game. Considering my PC handles Battlefield 4 with stable 65fps on Ultra, do you think it's logical that i get 20fps at max on such outdated engine with old 1998 textures and 800x600 resolution? 3.Hackers. This is literaly the most hacked CoD game by date. Literaly a world record. Considering that I've been an admin for 2 years, I can perfectly recognise a hacker, not to mention these hackers don't even hide the hacks, they directly jump with their agressive aimbot and godmode + all perks. 4.Mouse input delay. Have a good aim? Good luck with mouse delay ;) 5.Worst matchmaking by date. 20k players and it takes ~5 minutes to find any game under 800 ping even though there are suposedley dedicated servers. To add to that, if you're from europe, 2/3 of the times it will matchmake you with russians/americans and vice-versa. 6.Overpriced. Not even worth 1/3 of the current price. 7. Poor anticheat and report system. This literaly does nothing. 8. No VAC. 9. No staff which takes care for hackers like in Black Ops 2.  On the other side, gameplay is pretty fun, big maps, good weapon + killstreak balance overall. Honestly if there were no matchmaking issues, hacker issues and FPS issues, this could have been the best CoD ever made.  Do not buy this game. Wait 'till it gets hacked and dedicated servers get available or hope for actual clientside ones to be available in the approximate 2 years :) ALRIGHTY GUYS, 2 YEARS HAVE PASSED AND THIS HAS NOT CHANGED SOOO...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just one more preorder, the publisher said Then we will unlock a cool hat for your head You'll save 10 percent if you order today The game is not out yet but we ask you to pay  The previews are glowing, so make no mistake this game is amazing though the screenshots are fake But check out this gameplay it's a vertical slice so before you have played it, please put down full price  We love all the fanboys so we ask you to pay, for our unfinished product that we'll patch the 1st day It's still bloody broken 6 months down the line But you got a free skinpack so it all turned out fine.  I trusted the trailer, oh why would they lie? They gave an xp boost so I just had to buy This game is atrocious, it should have been free But I just cannot wait to buy the dlc.   Just One More Preorder  by John  TotalBiscuit  Bain"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't want to waste my time writing a review for this utter crap, but I just want to warn you people (yes, as you can tell, i am quite â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥). Don't buy this game. It's just so freaking bad, it's hilarious.  It's not the same story that was with MW3, it being a re-skin copy+paste of MW2, they actually made some new 'innovations' (if you can call them like that) and changes in this game, like... dogs. On second thought, there really isn't much new here.   Though, that being said, they took out way more things than they added. Forget theater, forget treyarch's amazing and actually innovative Pick-10 system, forget in-game livestreaming or League. That's all tossed in the trash.  Oh, and let's not even begin about the state of this game on PC. It's a joke, IW are literally saying 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you' to every single PC player. No FOV slider, no dedicated servers, framerate capped at 90 fps (the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?) and the fact this game lags, freezes, stutters, drops fps even on beast PC gaming rigs. It's just sad. And if you saw them say 'we are working with Nvidia to make the game look better' yeah.. that's also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, Treyarch's last years Black Ops 2 looked better.  Anyway, please don't buy this, get Black Ops 2 instead or Battlefield 4 and play a good, well optimised and good looking PC games instead of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥/10  do not buy  avoid  no  NO.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just 5 simple words: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Its so bad. Words cant even describe how bad it actually is on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Got VAC banned for changing fov.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"laggy , hackers even laggy in lobby setting classes up only had it 1 day not happy should have got bf4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So we have fish! Move out of the way when you get close to them.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Garbage, and not worth the money.]"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not even worth an install still lags on low settings it doesnt matter what settings it just lags and uses 6gb ram for no reason probably the last cod on pc, the last cod i will ever buy. The multiplayer laggs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unplayable it seems good but its just not playable lag in the menu no FOV changer, singleplay is just average no deep story, extinction is cool but gets boring quick, safe guard is also nice but if you hit wave 40+ it's starting to get boring.  Rating (4,5/10) Unfinished game not made for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I played about...2 hours of campaign, got bored and went to multiplayer. Had one fantastic match then this has been my experience since.  OHGOD AIMBOT OHGOD WALLHACK OHGOD NOOBTEAM OHGOD SPEEDHACK OHGOD WHYYYYY?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity Ward is nothing more than a husk nowadays. This is easily their worst Call of Duty game and an abysmal PC port overall. I would recommend Advanced Warfare or Treyarch's new CoD in 2015. Don't bother with IW anymore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-hackers (i have already saw 5 ,in a whole year in black ops2 i saw 2 hackers)(25/11/13) -no FOV slider -capped to 91 fps -no theater mode -no sound options (only one bar for volume) -bad performance even on high end pc's(badly optimised)  +good graphics +the call of duty gameplay we love to have +server lobbies(no hosts)  5 steps back from from black ops 2 ..why they dont learn from treyarch ???!!! already waiting for the next november"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will admit that I have a weird sort of soft spot for Call of Duty. It's an absurdly simple franchise that never changes, but it never tries to appeal outside its target demographic. And hey, Black Ops 2 was surprisingly decent. So Ghosts could've been good, right?  The key word here is 'could'.  Ghosts is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trainwreck. The campaign is awful, 4 hours long, and poorly written to the point where we've finally reached the stage where the villains literally are faceless brown people. The multiplayer is broken to hell and back with its spawn points and god-awful netcode. The lag compensation that hampers a player's experience is amped up to a degree in which it's never been in the Call of Duty franchise.  Oh, and the porting job. This is one of the absolute worst PC ports of all time. It doesn't look good, it runs like garbage on any setup, and it's filled to the brim with micro-stuttering and frame skipping. If you want to jump through the billion hoops this game requires to achieve a smooth gameplay experience, all you will get yourself is a drab and boring rehash. Everything Treyarch attempted to freshen up the series, Nu-Infinity Ward retracted. Stay far away from this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why did I buy this game?  One day I felt like shooting stuff in a new environment.  Then I realized that I have Battlefield 3, which is monumentally better than this rotting pile of regurgitated gorilla sh!t."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD for PC ever. Just don't waste your money, besides the horrible gameplay the game runs really poorly on PC and you can really tell that they didn't put much effort or time into making it a decent PC port."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the main character isnt a dog. 3/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would only recommend this to die-hard COD fans. Otherwise give it a miss. And NEVER buy it for full price, it's just not worth it. Wait untill it goes on sale. 5.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Free weekend is still too much for this garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is absolute garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"0/10  Bought the game, downloaded and installed the 30gb of crap, Started it and played, noticed that the performance sucks. It disconnects every game and says the Call of duty Ghosts Crap servers are offline,  I don't even get why people are still playing this. I mean 300 people don't mind the disconnects etc. Sad what Call of Duty has come to."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Activision hasn't made any changes to the Call Of Duty franchise. Why is everyone surprised? Activision has given us the same game every year.  The only difference is new maps, guns, and another terrible campaign. The only reason people ever buy the game is because of all the money Activision puts into media hype and paying reviewers to give it 4/5 stars.  When will people ever learn? Call of Duty is over-rated garbage"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No, I personally do not recommend this game. I use to enjoy all of the call of duty games for a time and thought i would enjoy this game more than Battlefield 4, so I purchased this game first. It was a mistake buying this game. No FoV slider, frame rates capped to 91, and all around just not enjoyable. If you were thinking about purchasing this, I would recommend against it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A game really too short in single player. An interesting multiplayer. Can't recommend it due to the excessive price of the game + DLC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad game + Bad port = wahr
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I thought it would be as awesome as Black Ops 2 or other CoDs i played... It sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Money waste.   -Boring -Same game since CoD:4 -Port
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward do not really care about PC gamers, and this game is the result of extremely unreasonable PC requirement and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC port, nevertheless it is the worst PC game I've ever bought, works terribly on PC with FPS drops regardless of your PC performance, and I suggest avoid spending 60 bucks over it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a joke. I think a mass class action lawsuit for failure to produce something worthy of a fraction of the money people had to pay just to play it let alone the cost of the game is in order. the grafics are jenky and the fps drops are the worst I have ever seen in my, short, 4 yrs of online (fps multi-player) gaming. It takes forever to find a game regardless the number of people in that mode (normally very low numbers in pc version). Aimbots are all over this game and don't try and hide it. I still see these people often so my guess is there is no policing of the game. The maps are garbage from a run-n-gun perspective. The maps are really catered towards the campers. Very buggy and glitchy over all. I think it may be time to look into another franchise as this one is an epic failure at this point. Fix the game and give us our dedicated servers with mod tools back and I may change my mind. Until then, COD is not something I would recomend to anyone. Actually, I have been going out of my way to tell people to avoid putting money in this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I work at a meme factory. Every day I make memes for hungry customers. One day this woman, probably about 60 years old walks in and requests a piping hot meme. When I pull out this meme, I ask for 6 shekels, which is the price. She cannot afford the meme and offers me a copy of Call Of Duty Ghosts to pay for this top quality meme. I accept it.  I go home, and pop in the old COD game. The game starts up, but then stops at the title screen. A midget, dressed in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ costume, jumps out of the computer monitor and starts to punch my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. He gives it the old right hook, then the left hook, then the right, then the left, then the right, then the left, then the right, then the left, then the right, then the left, then the right, then the left, then the right, then theleft, then the right, then the left, then he takes a bite, then the right, then the left, then the right, then the left, then the right for the last time. I ask him what is going on and I look at my poorly beaten â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. He says, 'This is COD Ghosts. You are welcome.' The man keeps punching me until I close the game.  The next day I bury the game in my backyard and cry for seven straight weeks.  COD Ghosts will break you.   COD Ghosts will end you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"OK...so I was bored and decided to replay give this game one more chance. AND DAMN THAT WAS A BAD DECISION.I CAN'T EVEN SAY HOW MANY THING ARE WRONG WITH THIS GAME AND WITH THIS FRANCHISE...

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unplayable and very much forgettable.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not a bad game but too buggy and laggy to recommend.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, it looks the exact same as MW3 and MW2, terrible, not worth 60$, Not even worth 10$"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No way is this crap worth 50 gigabytes.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Utterly UTTERLY dreadful. I bought this on a whim thinking I'd enjoy a few hours of eye candy and cheap cinematic thrills. What I experienced was blurry, ugly visuals and dull, uninsipired set peices. This is, without question, the worst shooter I have ever played. Do. not. buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While gameplay-wise it's still pretty much CoD, bringing just little new things to the table, it's still a CoD-game so if you liked the previous one, you may as well be liking this one.  The thing which makes Ghosts have a 'nope' for my recommendation though is the state of how badly optimised the game is. It does not look  that  much better than Black Ops 2 did, but demands way more juice from your system than that.  To also compare it to other video-games: Battlefield 4, the 'other' big shooter of last year which direclty competed with Ghosts, runs at maximum settings and 1080p with always above 60 FPS for most new machines. If you take the same rig for a spin on Ghosts you actually have to tone down the graphics a notch to get into CoD-playable regions, since CoD also - always - had strong disadvantages if your FPS is all over the place and not at a rock solid 60+. Things like mouse-lag, input-lag in general and even rounding-errors (your guns fire faster/slower depending on what FPS you run at). Meanwhile it looks vastly inferiour to the direct competitor.  So yeah, that's a no. Don't waste your money on this. I did and I regret it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. I don't know how they've done it, but i've never seen a worse COD (including COD 3). FOV 65 , 90HZ , a laggy multiplayer from the last decade , and unjustified bad performance. The graphic quality and the perfomance it takes is beyond bad. It is more like absurdly hellish.  Has one positive point though: The Leveldesign is pretty good.  Afterall it feels like they lost all their programmers and now just a bunch of designers are working on COD. It's just sad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have always enjoyed the CoD series just as much as anyone else but this dosent even cut it. This is the worst CoD to date. My experience has been nothing but continuous crashing and lagging. The patch helped a little bit but the damage was already done. Launch day there were 35K people playing this game. Now most nights only 4K people will be on. Most of the new game type lobbies are empty and no one to play with, like Hunted.  Removing the most beloved objective game modes from the game was just plain dumb. I blame Mark Rubin for creating a mess of a game. Where are the dedicated servers? Oh there arent any, they are hybrid servers supposedly but still P2P. Which means if you have a SSD, you will more than likely be host and get shot up by those who are lagging before you see them.  The leveling system is ridiculous, YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO PLAY MP to get tokens to buy all the best weapons and perks. Simply play some Squad matches and get the tokens you need to get your Character the best weapons, perks, and attachements before even playing online versus. The leveling system should have been kept seperate from Squads and MP.  The amount of hackers playing the game killed it entirely. I have given this game enough chance to know it is ruined. I do enjoy the map sizes. The maps are really incredible but the color palette sucks.  One last note. NVIDIA Geforce Experience says I can play this game on the highest settings. COD tells me to set everything to the lowest settings. This tells you there is some very poor optimization for this game to run on PC.   I give this game 2/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, want my money back"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is really bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Highly unstable. Non stop stuttering and frame drops. The low field of view is appauling. I tried the FoV changer, but it doesn't sort it when you zoom in/aim down sights.. it just puts you back to 65 FoV which is nauseating. I'm convinced that Infinity Ward purposely leave out a field of view slider for PC because of the lazy and unfinished animations. At the beginning of the campaign with 90 FoV using AgentRev's fix, you can see your hands on the bottom of the screen, but more arms pop out of the side during cut scene events with the other hands still present. The same happened in MW3 MP. When increasing the field of view, you could see dodgy reload animations or while sprinting, some guns would look messed up.    When IW make a Call of Duty game. They don't even have the PC in mind. We come last. I have no clue why I purchased this game. I was bored I guess and wanted something to pass the time by. I already regret my purchase.    Avoid like the plague. 3/10 for the slightly improved graphics."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is worse than my chance of getting a girlfriend.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty weak episode in the series. The singleplayer is linear, unemotional, poorly scripted, and dispite action and cool locations it ends up being pretty boring. The multiplayer is sluggish, and dispite balanced maps and better streak rewards, lag-correction and unrealistic weapons ruin it for me. Back to Black Ops 2!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I got a good PC but the game still gives me framelags. The Dogs are overpowerd i still ask myself why they didnt called it Call of Duty Dogs. The guns suck... you can buy guns with DLC's super, there are also people who dont have the money for the weapon DLC's but the developers only think about the money thats sad what CoD has come to its only about moneymaking they don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about gameplay or the community. But the best part is when they said that the fishes swim away. I mean really ? Also in Mario 64 the fishes swam away... SAD "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Predictable nonsense that you can sniff from a mile away. Buggy and broken. You'd only like this if you smush Doritos into dust and snort it while praising Geoff Keighley and licking a picture of Bobby Kotick while grinning as you grind yourself against IGN's reviews.   I'm sorry, what does this bring to the CoD series? Nothing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"4/10 This game's campaign was more confusing than fun, and felt very repetitive. The multiplayer got boring within hours, not nearly as fun as BO2. The Alien co-op thing was unoptimized and very very boring.  The graphics were decent, but the game ran pretty badly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst Game I ever played. Horrible Performance, needs way to much specs and space for bad graphics and miserable Net-code. Multiplayer has no servers only P2P, results in a unenjoyably Playing Experience. Singleplayer isn't even worth installing. In total just good if you like getting rid of bad things. The five minutes of uninstalling the game were the best five minutes I had with that game. If you pay more than 1$ for that game it's a waste of money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghost is the latest installment in gamings biggest franchise. Let's get right to the point...  The PC Port is simply not good enough! Be it strange frame rate limits, horrible field of view and sub par visuals. If everything else was fine then I would most likely be able to let these issues slide. However, on top of all this we have the crappy performance that makes the game almost unplayable on even the best of systems. The gameplay is pretty much what you can expect from a Call of Duty title... So if thats all your after... Go ahead... Good Luck...  Check the video review here :         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  PC Review: Call of Duty Ghost! - [Multiplayer / PC Port Focused Review]&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I will give Activision 100 bucks if they can make the game worse.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not as good as promised. sucker punched in the wallet.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Aight. First things first: I got this game for my BD, and I tell you it's not a kind of gift you enjoy with easy heart. Also, I don't really like to write or read massive texts in Steam Reviews corner, but...  I never expected   Ghosts   to be spectacularly joyfull game, however I had good expectations on multiplayer and new cooperative mode with those cryptids.  Now, it could take a very long time to describe how all these expectations were ruined by actual gameplay in both of those modes. If you ask me for a review, I would tell you that it's better to head over Steam Discussions in game center and read few of those ' I regret buying this '-posts, because it's the best review you could get. Someone thinks it's a waste of money and time, I agree. Surprisingly, there are quite a bunch of lads who tryin' to... I don't know? defend this poor product for some uknown reason.  Speaking of me, I only could tell I like to play Extinction from time to time, maybe some multiplayer hardcore modes (without that awful HUD) but that's about it. Singleplayer campaign doesn't really interest me. Seriously... Dogs? Whatever.  Not recommended. Between   Modern Warfare 3   and   Ghosts  , pick   Modern Warfare 3  .  Now, for the last part of my essential essay, I already know there is a lot of people who enjoys to disagree and become a kind of 'combo-breaker' out there, and I don't really think it's bad. How they say on interwebs? 'Haters gonna hate'. Well, if you think you would feel better if you put a red vote on here - go on. I only want to remind that it is my personal honest opinion and some really agree with me.  Thanks for attention  P.S.: Written  14.09.2014  (yeah, a whole while since release), haven't been uploaded due to rules as it required at least 5 minutes of singleplayer campaign on account."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game really bad, very crooked 'new engine', poor story, and bad optimization on PC, sound like from sims. Graphics 6 from 10. Gameplay 5 from 10. Story 3 from 10. Sound 0 from 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is 10% suck 20% skill 15% concentrated power will  5% pleasure  50% pain and 0% reason to purchase this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you're thinking about buying this atrocity, at least on PC, you already know it doesnt have good gameplay, but thats not why I regret buying it  1. its stuck at 65 fov, so it looks like ur stuck in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing medieval helmet 2. its framelocked at 90 fps 3. the framerate constantly drops, its a very unoptimized game 4. running fraps, steam overlay, or any type of overlay will cause huge memory leaks 5. you need to disable most graphics options to prevent huge framerate drops/memory leaks 6. the game has unremovable mouse accel 7. everyone in the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at FPS, but its probably cuz of the issues above"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is not optimized for high powered gaming rigs. I can not even finish campaign do to the stutter. Multiplayer gameplay also suffers from framerate stutter and menu lag. It is almost impossible to create your class in between matches dealing with the lag in the menus. There is no connection preferences so you will be playing with people on other continents. They even removed your ping status in match so there are no more bars or numbers telling you your latency (connection) to the server. You can turn on the lag-o-meter in your config but that will only show the quality of the connection and not the latency. Oh yeah and in typical IW fashion they kept the FOV option out of the game. The only upside to this game was the bigger maps and the removal of the dual weilding machine pistols.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well i think its safe to say that this call of duty was a massive flop, not only was the multiplayer the same thing again even after the new elements they put in but also the single player didnt seem to have as much edge as the other ones in recent call of duty games. Now dont get my wrong there were some fun moments in the single player campain but overall it seemed to lack something that im not quite sure what is it but im sure most would agree. As for the multiplayer its fun at first with the new things to play with but it gets pretty damn boring after the first week or so because your generally doing the same thing over and over and this includes the extinction game mode, as i said at first its pretty fun but then your just doing the same thing over and over. But hey for some people thats okay but in my personal opinion it just wasnt anything new and just seemed like another boring call of duty."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No. No... Just no.  I liked the campaign better than mutliplayer, but I dont just buy First Person Shooters for a campaign.  The story is written decently, but the levels and characters make it look like a low budget Sci-Fi movie. The only 'good' part was the Dog, but he only appeared in a few missions.  The mulitplayer is the just horrid. Bad Maps, Bad Guns, I dont even get why there is 30+ perks, and the Character Customization. I'm just waiting for the MMO of Call of Duty, cause this game is turning out like a very bad MMO. If you want this game, I suggest Tetris first. Why? Tetris is better"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Prime example of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game, no work was put into the PC version."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,STAY FAR AWAY!! Banned after 1 minute of play for using Widescreen Fixer. The game now offers the widescreen fix and this is activisions response: Thank you for contacting Activision Support. The account in question has been found in violation of the games's Security and Policy. A permanently suspension has been placed on the account and will not be able to participate in online play. No further discussions should be take place. Please check the Call of Duty: Ghosts Security &amp; Enforcement Policy for more info  https://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Call-of-Duty-Ghosts-Online-Code-of-Conduct/    Many have had issues but for me COD AW was my final dime spent for Activision.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst FPS-Multiplayer made 2013.  Mechanics: trash. Equipment: trash. Engine: trash. Interface: trash. Options: trash... The only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing working on this game is the WASD-keys and the mouse.  It's a poorly assembled scoop-up of all the things that seem viable in the other COD games and then just choked straight to Satan. I'll give some credit to the designers with the idea to create some diversity in how progress is made with level and all, but thanks to the programmers and platform-developers; my frustration with this game is not going to allow me to progress. I'm battling more controls and interface than enemies. Even old Runescape had more reliable gameplay.  I have given this game a lot of chanses to let me like it, but every god damn time I try, it just stabs me with a knife. Only remotly acceptable reason to buying this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is if you loved the campaign as much as a drug addict loves heroin. If not, download a crack and play the campaign there.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I want a refund. This game would have been great if it was a propper pc port and actually had people playing in.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is travesty on PC. It just doesnt run well and no FOV option. IW screwed PC, don't buy this. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I got this one for free from a gaming Magazine. This is truly one of the worst games I've ever played. It's just another Call of Duty which has been â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up.   Don't. Buy. This. Crap.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single palyer is not that bad but multiplayer is a complete downgrade from Black Ops 2 multiplayer ...  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After three patches the game is still a bit of a mess, to some an even bigger mess than before. Wait unless you must have the latest COD, or you think Infinity Ward can do no wrong. Anyhow, SP is even dumber than previous COD installments. Quite the feat considering the absurdity of MW3 and BLOPS campaing"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-awful. -want money back. -framerate is terrible, even on lowest settings. -no optimization for PC. -at most 6000 players online ever -peer to peer lag is awful -still matchmaking, on a PC game, i mean come on, it's 2014, get with it, no pc gamer wants this. -most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weapons, like a revolving shotgun and the M4 just rehashed over and over -lame killstreaks -the chainsaw is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  -akimbo is somehow still a thing, have you ever seen a real operator do this? -the whole 'ghosts' thing gets VERY cliche'd -i would get more fun out of this much money spent at laser tag. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I could have bought like 20 hamsters instead of this...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you can have it back but i want my money -999/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get placed straight into an american server, no searching for servers near you, only servers that are laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD: Dogshit.  90 fps lock Looks a tad better than blops 2 yet plays significantly worse (stutter/choppy on latest nvidia drivers, gtx 670, 3770K @ 3.9 Ghz, 8 GB DDR3 Ram @ 2133 Mhz) Maps are absolute garbage (debris everywhere, inexplicably complex and ratmaze-like structure with numerous camping spots. Also disproportionately big ) No ping indicator anywhere. No numbers, no bars, nada.  At its current state i'd advise anyone to get blops2 over this if he is interested in cod. It is by far superior."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I believe this game will be dead soon , i thought i will enjoy it like i did in Modern Warfare 1 , 2 and 3, but after Ghost i really believe i will not buy any Call Of Duty games anymore.  In this game you cant do any other thing outside the scenario which is written in very disappointing way, after the famous legend ghost in MW2 they named this game because players loved him, but actually they destroyed their own legacy by creating an army from that character which made him lose his value as a part of Call Of Duty stories.   Anyway if you don't care about that, the whole differences between this games and the one befor are some details and some Multiplayer stupid features that also you have to buy to be special."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,First off the hitbox works fine and i like the reduced sight with a 'zoomed in' sniper rifle.  The Field of View was set to 60 at release and got patched after several months to 80 max (atleast). At release the Game wasn't playable on my native resolution with the lowest settings without any laggs. After a year(there was a performance patch in between) in I can atleast play the game at my native resolution(1920x1080) fluently on the lowest settings. If I try to put anything up i get laggs from time to time. This is still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cause you can count the pixels on your screen. Just to mention i can play Skyrim on nearly highest settings.  I didn't played singleplayer alot cause i cant enjoy with this crappy grafics explained above.  Conclusion: This is the worst game of the 'Call of Duty' series  PS: I dont played 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3'
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Funniest thing:  There's a common bug - single player freezes. And there's another common bug - multiplayer freezes. Steam support redirects fire to Activision, and activision redirects back to Steam. Chatting with support for hours - best fun I ever had.  P.S. Don't be a sucker and pay full price, this game can be found around in resalers for around 5$. And for those who are not happy with my review since there is no info on the game - there's a good reason: Due to those bugs, I never really got to play it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game, executed wrongly. The commitment of Infinity Ward and Activision have been questionable with the latest installment in the CoD series. On release day there was of course the 6gb of RAM requirement which there was no explanation for (now lowered to 4gb RAM requirement which is standard for a game now a days). It seems although the heads of the developers have been elsewhere with the 'Next Gen' consoles coming out and have still failed to fully optimise multiplayer (Every other call of duty you could get 80+ FPS on a nvidia GTX650Ti on high-ultra settings) let alone rid the game of hackers with what feels like a non existent anti-cheat system. I put plenty of hours into this on release weekend and have never really touched it since. I'm curious to see what the DLC will bring although i must say i'm not to keen on spending more money on a game that i might never touch again. Anyway with that being said here is some of my thoughts  The positives :  - Infinity Ward/Activision did release a further optimised patch to show they care but the game is still poorly optimised compared to others. Saying that, campaign is way better optimised than Multiplayer and is actually playable. - Controlling riley is a nice feature (Just not worth 32.4gb of my hard drive.)  - Extinction was a nice attempt to make something of this game. (I enjoyed this game mode. Just gets very repetitive.) - Squads/Spec Ops is in this game. (Although i feel it has been kind of neglected.)  The negatives - Bad optimisation. Possibly the worst port to date? - The number of hackers online is unbelievable - Campaign missions are really lacking that something, i was kind of lost and struggling to connect what i done in missions had to do with the actual story.  - Player base has already dropped so much be it down to hackers, bad optimisation or the repetitive gameplay mechanics. - 'Next Gen' game made on the ancient call of duty engine with a couple of tweaks here and there.  I would not recommend buying this game unless there is some significant changes and finally some attention paid to the PC Port for once by Infinity Ward. Overall Score: 5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No ghosts found, wasn't spooked. 0/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,They didn't hear about optimalization
Call of Duty: Ghosts,kids and campers ruined multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The most broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I've ever had the pleasure to toy around with.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game is the worst cod in the history
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"IWemy Ashit-130 above! Damn Activision n IW has improved their lazy to develop their games.  COD : Ghost is one of the worst title in COD series.  There is no innovation, and developing about all kinds of contents.  Story is boring, and ridiculous.   Same as all franchise title of COD, This game has never respected player's thinking, choice, and all thing what we want to be portion of this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible. This game is bad in general, but even worse for PC. If you get this game you WILL regret it.  0/âˆž - Everyone that I know that has played this game for PC, including me. Just don't buy it ok? I don't even want to get into all of the cons for this game...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"  Would be easy to say the same criticisms that everyone else does, so I'll try and keep it brief to get to the point. The campaign was... alright. A bit predictable often, but had some nice gameplay, level design, and fun achievements to... achieve. Despite the campaigns flaws, I did legitimately enjoy it. These carry over to multiplayer pretty well, but comes with the downside of not only this game but pretty much every Call of Duty game.  The main issue with Call of Duty games, and the reason why I do not recommend buying them is not because of the expensive and excessive DLC, but because the game dies too quickly. For whatever reason, Activision tells their developer companies to force out a game yearly. This causes the very misguided fanbase to drop the previous game and grab the new one. As such, the multiplayer community in this dies, leaving only the cheaters, the max prestige pros (who know the spawns, where to prefire, how to snap onto targets, and have played this since release in 2014), and the newbies who try... and fail... to get into the game. For $60 this game is a ripoff, and for why they don't lower the price sooner, considering how quickly they kill off their own game, is beyond me.   In short, despite myself enjoying this to some degree; don't buy this (or in my opinion, any CoD) game. Call of Duty fragments their community yearly making them choose between buying their new product which is steadily decreasing in quality or continue playing a game that withers in less than 2 years of being released. All this due to a dissipating community on their 'older' games (12 months brah), immediate cut of support, and lack of care for their own product."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Steam please delete this game from my profile and give the money to aid Ebola. Thank you :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I know for sure I will rot in hell just for buying this game. I'm ashamed ... Satan tricked me again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Story is really awesome but the balance of the game sucks!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why did I bother buying this rubbish, oh thats right, because they said they would add mod support for this, and they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lied, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward, you've lost another customer, I'm never buying you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ COD games ever again..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"MP review only: Why are there so many haters of this game was my thought. I liked it, really. Bought all the dlcs and some personalisation stuff. And here I am permanently banned for no reason (not VAC, but some dev ban) and can't even play extinction mode.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game would be better and more fun if the hackers would not be allowed in as with day one (on release) this game already had hackers using aimbots, wall hacks, quick scoping and various other hacks. After promises of no quick scoping, harder for hackers to use hacks and other promises by Infinity Ward, refunds should be given to those who want thier money back. Also tons of game issues such as lag, stuttering, FPS, video quality and such have cause everyone problems playing the game and again with the hackers out in full force it's even harder to play. Maybe in a 6-10 months of Infinity Ward fixing game issues this might be worth half the price it is being sold for. But get a ban program for hackers to get banned and it will be worth the money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No no no. I have liked most of the Call of Duty games especially the older ones, but they seem to be getting worse and worse for every new release. Call of Duty: Ghosts has to be the worst CoD game so far.  I can not get it to run properly, it stutters, freezes and crashes.  When i'm playing multiplayer, if i'm lucky it only crash to desktop, if im not it gives me the blue screen of death, and this happens everytime, sometimes it takes 5 minutes and other times I can play for 45 min - 1 hour before it shuts down.  In singleplayer I cant progress any further as the game keeps crashing on one particular spot in the same mission.  Would not buy again!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no anti cheat so the game is full of hackers no control of servers and still waiting for any news on dedicated servers also lack of fov slider and capping fps is not the way pc should run it if we wanted a x box or ps4 we would have bought one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wonder if Infinity Ward developed an XBOX emulator for this game. This is an unfinished, unoptimized product. They should release a proper PC version of the game. The netcode is garbage, we need dedicated servers. Matchmaking system is a bit slow. The graphics are awesome compared to the previous CoD titles but you need a REALLY high-end computer to play this smoothly.  Also after playing for an hour, I'm now 100% sure that Activision bribes game reviewers. It's amazing to read some reviewers praise the worst spawn system I've ever seen.  The UI is cool, being able to customize the player model is cool. I miss the 'Pick 10' system of Treyarch but this is alright too, I guess. Weapons, equipments and killstreaks are balanced well. I enjoyed having a guard dog companion.  I encountered too many cheaters, almost one in every match. It's quite annoying but maybe it's related to the free weekend that's going on right now. Time will tell.  Still seeing gun barrels sticking out of the walls in this year. Just how hard it is to fix this?  I kind of have a buyer's remorse now because I already own Black Ops II which seems like a better game than this. Play Black Ops II, not this.  I'll update this review after I finish the single-player campaign but I never really found CoD campaigns interesting after CoD4:MW."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Short: I won't buy a new CoD-game, before this one gets patched, until it workes the way, the community wants it to. (Maybe another title by Treyarch, cause their studio disappointed me the least.) FINAL POINT   10/10 would throw away... Disaster, that you can't throw away Steam-Games.  Edit: NOW YOU CAN DELETE GAMES FROM YOUR STEAM-ACCOUNT so you CAN throw it away :D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First of all, i would like to address my time spent with this game. I do not own the game on this account. I just happened to have a friend who bought one, who let me try it out. All of this was before steam family sharing. Otherwise, i spent about 6 hrs with the singleplayer and 20 hrs in multiplayer.  Now to the game itself. Call of Duty Ghosts is the 10th game in the franchise, released in november 2013.  One thing i want to mention is of the game's requirements. They ask too much, yet don't really make it look better than Battlefield for example, which clearly shows that no effort was put into optimization of the game.  The game is of very poor quality and optimization wasn't the only victim. The sounds aren't all that great too.          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  COD: Ghosts vs BF4 - Weapon Sounds PART 1&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unoptimized mess. Developer doesn't care about the community. Spend your money elsewhere.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Definately NOT worth the 59.99â‚¬ wanted for this game, I was very disapointed in this game. I have been playing Call Of Duty since the first one came out when I was 17 and I honestly feel this one is the worst for Story Line, (Modern Warfare and Black Ops story was way better) Playability isn't that good and I don't believe this one was well thought out, I also think it was put together with minimal effort and expense.  As for the multiplayer....don't even bother playing it, It's already full of wallhackers and aimbots. The only thing going for the multiplayer is the new Squads mode, the only part I actually like about this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is my first not recommended game out of the about 375 games I have on Steam. I have to say, I am 100% not impressed. Multiple issues with the gameplay, performance issues, low player count, and as of 23Nov13, a huge hacker problem. The biggest issue, is that the developers actively refuse to do anything about the problems. The forums are filled with problems and the 'moderators' have actually quit ignoring the threads, now what they're doing is giving the exact, and when I say exact, I mean 'word for word,' same generic answers to every thread made for whichever thread type and immediately locking the thread. I have sent multiple emails to Infinity Ward and Activision, I have posted 11 questions on the official forums, I have called both Activision and Infinity Ward, but have literally gotten no help. I have never, even with brand new indie developers had such a horrible experience with a game or its developers. I have actually gone ahead and filed a complaint through the Better Business Bureau because of it. Hope this helps if you're thinking about getting this game. I'd say, PASS."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"How did Mexicans with guns make it into space unnoticed, let alone, allowed to dock onto a space station?  Why do astronauts wear their full spacesuits with jetpacks inside a space station?  'Press Left Mouse Click to destroy satellite' forced moment.  Why were trenches built on Santa Monica beach, wouldn't they get filled with ocean water? Also, why are we stuck on the balcony for 10 minutes with a helicopter attacking us but not really attacking us?  Can A-10 Warthog really be remote controlled like drones?  Why does San Diego look more like Boulder, Colorado?  How come we can unload multiple clips into the deer and they won't die?  How do you and your brother not recognize your dad wearing a Ghost mask who has been speaking for the past 10 minutes?  Was the slow depressing train ride level at the end a figurative characteization of the underdeveloped protagonists in the story who we never really come to care about?  Almost forgot about the dog Riley who was only sort of useful in one level, and then forgettably hid in a corner for the rest of the game."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Note: I am a big fan of the Modern Warfare series. The single player &amp; spec ops there was great. I hated Black Ops.  Setting aside the copy/paste model that is Call of Duty, this felt really lazy. A lot has been lifted from the MW series and the levels are formulaic and generic. Now, that's not to say I didn't have fun. The levels are entertaining, the gameplay is entertaining, this wasn't a waste of time. The problem is that it's 1, maybe 2 non-story related achievements per level. Instead of 3-4 intels per level, its 1 per level for a total of 18. More than half of the intels are unmissable, unlike in the MW series where they spent effort hiding them.  I realize these games aren't supposed to be realistic, but they really jumped the shark to where I'm just going 'Oh come on, really? Really?' The space fights are fun, but they're so over the top &amp; silly that it just underlines what the series has become. The story is very forgettable, the characters are boring, the writing is full of clichÃ©s. The villains in the MW series had legitimate reasons, they were memorable, they were interesting. The main villain in Ghosts is just a stereotypical bad guy. His reasons are 'Because I'm the bad guy. Argh!'  When one of the characters predictably dies in the cheesiest, clichÃ©d way possible, I didn't care. I care more about the dog, Riley, than any of the human characters. The writing, gameplay &amp; storytelling are all very lazy. The game is a parady of itself. They need to stop pooping out this model every year until they can come up with something original. Oh, and then they try to brag about their graphics. I mean, it looks nice but it's not going to blow you away. The graphics in the Metro series look better, and nobody cares about graphics so try again.  I do emphasize that I had fun playing the game, but I can have fun throwing a tennis ball against the wall repeatedly. That doesn't mean Tennis Ball Wall-Thrower Simulator 2013 would worthy of a recommend from me.  I could recommend this game at $5 as a mindless, popcorn action shooter, but greedy Activision won't even bring it down to $9.99 until about 2018. At least the MW series I could say has replay value, redeemable qualities &amp; is worth $10-15. This is quite worthy of all the hate it gets."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :D  Pastry  2 cups all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon salt   2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening   4 to 6 tablespoons cold water   Filling  1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar   1/4 cup all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg   1/8 teaspoon salt   8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium)   2 tablespoons butter or margarine   1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).  2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.  3) Heat oven to 425Â°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.  4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.  5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.  6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it,s a very bad game,the hackers are making it so that the average player want come back to the gam the game crashing all the time for alot of players also puts you off it activision need to get there act together and use another engine because this 1 is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,also start to look after the pc gamer not just the console guys we spend heaps of money on our system also , steam needs to bring back dedecated servers so we can get rid of the hacking maggats that ruin this game, it realy has been a waist of $90."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pure waste of money. Game is still unplayable. Crashes all the time, looks awful and there are tons of stupid DLCs instead of one desperatedly needed patch that might repair the gamecode and make it at least playable. I wasn'r able to finish this game on singleplayer as it causes constant CTDs. Despite so many times i tried to just finish this in SP i had constant crashes and loading times are so long, it is beyond me. So, I tried multiplayer and well, it's dull. Worst MP I have ever seen. Small maps, small teams, dull weapons and game modes. IMO this game is not even on alpha stage. Why this has been released is beyond me. Darnn, I wish I could get refund for this game. AVOID IT AT ALL COST. Do NOT waste your money and do not support these lousy devs who don't give a sh-t about the players and just try to rip you of the money. 0/10 for not being able to run this game without CTDs and finish SP campaign."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful Game. Not even close to being worth the $60 dollar price. Maybe $10 at most.

With awful hit registration, incredibely low health and an unfair connection advantage, Ghosts proves to be the worst Call Of Duty and/or FPS game ever created.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In 2007, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was released, bringing with it sweeping changes to FPS games; Gone were the health pack pickups, the (then) overdone WWII setting and dull sprawling levels. In came tight focussed maps, peppered with jaw dropping set pieces, memorable and inventive levels to break up the pace of the game ('Death from Above', 'All Ghillied Up'), all contributed to make an intense cinematic experience that was genuinely refreshing at the time and well received by the majority of gamers.  Moving onto 2013 and Call of Duty: Ghosts, the latest in a now annually released and stale franchise. Everything that made COD4 such a success is now turgidly reproduced ad nauseum in a manner that slowly renders the players brain to rancid cheese. Linear, grey levels now inject so many set pieces that control is wrested from the player constantly so they can't possibly miss the next explosion or NPC delivering a punch to the face of the protagonist. What was once cinematic and exciting is now just a trudge through a quicktime hell interspersed with the opportunity to shoot some heads of pop up cannon fodder, enemies still using 7 year old AI routines. COD4's NPCs were entertaining, if heavily caricatured characters, from Captain Price's tough &amp; rough SAS leader to Gaz's amusing Jason Statham-esque Cockney sidekick. All helped drive the narrative on as you played, with minimum cut-scene intervention. Ghosts, by contrast, features a cast of cardboard cutout meatheads, who solely seem to exist as moving objective markers for the player all the while urging the player to 'Check your six' apparently for Oscar Mike who I believe has yet to actually show his face in a Call of Duty game to date, despite all the rigorous checking that we're urged to participate in. Speaking of characters, we get to the villain of the piece; All good action narrative needs a great bad guy to orchestrate the violence and COD4 provided us with two of them, Khaled Al-Asad and Imran Zakhaev, extremists forged by post-Soviet Middle Eastern and East European politics, who conspire to drag the world into global conflict, forcing the player in a race against time to save the world in spectacularly enjoyable and overblown fashion. Ghosts' Rorke (Rourke? Rork? Zork?) is a revenge fueled berk, supposedly created by a bit of an accident and some brain washing exercise and.... yeah something and stuff happened, oooh what a nasty boy he is and no mistake.  All of this is presented by a dated graphics engine, hardly evolved from the original COD4 release. Murky, dull textures. A colour pallette that seems to consist of only brown and greys. Animation which looks clunky and unnatural, especially in contrast to the dog, Riley, which has clearly had time invested in to make it move realistically and only serves to make the human characters look even more janky. All conspire to deliver a washed out experience of a game that fails to excite or stir the player.  A by the numbers action game that delivers zero innovation, zero entertainment and the gaming equivalent of an unwelcome, beer induced turd into your Steam library, leaving a putrid smell and a stuborn stain on the side of the pan that no amount of bog brushing will remove."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Disclaimer: I cannot abide the competitive Call of Duty multiplayer scene, and avoid it. This review does not touch on the competitive multiplayer component.  Single Player: In the fashion of the later Call of Duty games, there are incredibly long portions of each mission during which you have no control of your character, and are forced to listen to dialogue or look at scenery.  The portions that you actually DO get to control your character are so narrow, linear, and short, that they are hardly worth mentioning. While there are some neat moments, they only appear once, briefly during the campaign, making it feel like a string of set pieces.  As for the story, it is laughable and unbelievable. I'd say it breaks the immersion, but the game never even lets you get immersed in the first place. I found myself not being able to relate to any of the characters, or finding any of them sympathetic. I'm also not sure if anyone vetted the absurd dialogue before recording it.  Extinction: Aliens made it into Call of Duty! This mode can be fun, if you have a competent team. There is no tutorial on the mechanics of this mode, so seeing new people running around, making things harder, can be difficult to watch sometimes. It can be brutally hard for new players, or teams with new players. It is nice in that it does not have the completely random feel of the competitive multiplayer, but is not just a string of set pieces and cutscenes like the campaign.  Overall: Ghosts plays like a bad action movie, and there is even less gameplay here than previous installments."
Call of Duty: Ghosts," piece.of. trash .   Save your money, buy something else you have on your wishlist. This 'game' is actually shouting 'how to make money with less effort' at you. If you're 'desperately' looking forward to play a Call of Duty game, then play CoD4:Modern Warfare, or the older titles. But please, save yourself some money and time, do NOT support this copy/paste recycling policy of Infinity Ward, TreyArch, Sledgehammer Games and Activision.  The AI literally sucks. This high praised dog and fish intelligence is just a joke, for example: they like to run/swim into walls/stones and many other things... and our human enemies, well ... trust me, they want to get shot. They're like: 'OH YAY, FINALLY THERE'S SOMEONE TO STOP MY SUFFERING IN THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE!'... oh wait, now i get them, thats actually intelligent.    Singleplayer   is like: shoot about 200 enemies, walk a little bit, explosion here, explosion there, again walk a little bit, explosion here, explosion there, shoot another 500 enemies, again explosion here and there, maybe try to sneak in this one?, get into a vehicle and shoot about 50000 enemies and yeah close to the end we can be grateful to experience another countless 9472 explosions because thats so fckin epic......   To summarise my review for the   multiplayer   part: copy/paste from the old games, hackers, cheaters, voicechat kids (nothing against kids, but this...), lags, unfriendly people and the good old 'i ve got the biggest boner' mentality of some players, kill 1 enemy - get promoted to level 245 (totally exaggerating, but still close enough)  If you're totally new to Call of Duty, you can give it a try (I WARNED YOU). But everyone else, everyone who has already 'experienced' a Call of Duty title - skip this like Mike Powell (yes, like that dude with that amazing long jump world record - 8,95m)  In my opinion, its absolutely not worth the money. Buy your girlfriend some flowers, go out and have a drink with your friends, buy your kids some icecream, but this... is as mentioned above a waste of money and time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts," http://community.callofduty.com/community/call_of_duty/english/ghosts/forums/pc   Check this out, all these complaints and none of them are getting answered.  Ghosts was a castastrophic failure. The game had potential, but the developers simply do not care. They released a $2 skin for a KILLSTREAK and even that didn't work.  Terrible frame rate across the board, dead population, apparently it reaches less than 3K at peak hours? NO anti-cheat whatsoever, there's no chance at all at the moment of anyone getting banned for hacking because IW simply does not give a damn...  Not to mention the hackers...oh man the hackers, there's so many hackers it was almost impossible for me to find a game without one...The EXACT same exploits from MW3 regarding killstreaks works in this iteration of CoD, there's a magnum that can destroy a helicopter with 2 - 3 hits, and kill everything else in 1, with near infinite penetration...  Oh, and there's no balaclava! I bet something like that will be DLC!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For a game called COD Ghost, there's a surprising lack of  spook fish  [en.wikipedia.org]  in it. Overused jokes aside, Call of Duty ghost is one of many Call of Duty titles set in roughly the present day. My own experiences with the series are limited to CoD 1, 4 &amp; 5. While shooters are not my main genre, I don't dislike them, and the previous games that I played were quite good shooters. This review is going to focus on the singleplayer aspect of the game. Currently there are less than 150 players playing this game, and that seems to indicate that multiplayer community is not exactly thriving.    Graphics &amp; Sound  You can tell that this game was given a big budget by just looking at it. The game looks quite good, with relatively detailed character models, animations that look believable and so on. The environments look good, with a realistic amount of 'clutter' items, foliage and other such things. And for a game with so much going on, it also runs surprisingly well on my humble machine, indicating that it's well optimized. One area where the game looks oddly bad is in its reflections. There are a lot of supposedly reflective surfaces in this game, from camera lenses, to most doors that you're not supposed to open, to shop windows where they don't want to model the inside. These reflections seem to be portals to some other place altogether, as they don't actually reflect their surrounding, they just show a totally different part of the level, in glorious low res (the reflections look really blocky, as if they've used a texture meant to be viewed from a long distance). The game lacks a real visual identity. Apart from the (rather nice looking) underwater sections, the game looks like any other modern military shooter. While this is to be expected, they could have picked some more visually interesting environments. That would really have helped the game stand out from all the other modern military shooters. The sound of the weapons sound beefy without going overboard, and help make using the guns feel more satisfying. They're not 'realistic', but they fit the tone of the game. Voice acting is quite good, with voice actors who seem to take their roles seriously, and who do a good job at portraying their characters. This helps prevent the game from feeling too hammy, something that otherwise could easily have happened had they hired worse voice actors.   Story &amp; setting  In a not so distant future a nation has built a space station capable of firing weapons of mass destruction at any location in the world. Feeling threatened, another nation hijacks the space station and turns its weapons against its former owner. A band of elite soldiers infiltrate the nation, and coldbloodedly murders civilians, blows up an oil platform and ruins the power infrastructure by blowing up their power plant. Oh, and you're playing for the team that clodbloodedly murders civilians and blows up oil platforms and power plants, and who builds space stations with weapons of mass destruction. I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to feel like I'm playing for the good guys. The game starts with your space station getting hijacked and several cities gets targeted. A few years later the US is fighting a losing war against South America, and the game early on shows how evil the South Americans are when they execute a group of civilians. This is framed as something terrible. But then a little later your team does exactly the same thing, shooting a person who cooperated with you in the back of the head, and this is portrayed as something good. I'm honestly not sure how aware the story writers were of these inconsistencies, if it's an intentional jab at the audience's willingness to just accept things if they're framed a certain way (it would not surprise me if it actually is). Most of the game is a hunt for a former member of the team, who after getting tortured or something switched side (the game never makes it clear what happened, all just alludes to it), and is targeting his former team members. There's nothing wrong with a really stupid action story, sometimes those can be really entertaining. CoD Ghost takes itself a bit too serious for its own good though, and the story is so inconsistent in its tone that it's very hard to take it serious. There's some unintentional humor to be had in the story of this game, but had it either taken itself less seriously or been less stupid, it would have been a far better one.   Gameplay  The gameplay is your standard shooter fare. It's not evolved much since Modern Warfare 1. Move through mostly linear levels, shoot enemies who come in waves, and repeat. Quite frequently the game tries to mix things up with sections where the gameplay changes completely, to varied results. At one point you're playing a stealth section as a dog (which could have been rather good, had it been more fleshed out and longer), at another you're swimming in a reef, and then you're controlling a tank in yet another section, or a helicopter, or a gun drone... The list of things goes on and on, and many of these non-standard shooting sections could have been good, had they not been over so quickly. The game is, as stated above, really linear, and most of the time the game does a good job at making it feel like you're not just being tunneled through it in a very specific way, as the level designers have been good at making the 'right' way be the most obvious way to go. This is good level design. No need for constant UI markers showing you where to go when the level does it for you. Sadly the arenas where you do most of the shooting are not very entertaining. There's very little room to actually move about, you're forced to just move between a few pieces of cover and take potshots at the enemy. And on the few occasions where there were a way to move around and flank the enemy, the AI got so confused that it would just sit there, in front of cover (from your perspective) and not do anything. The AI was clearly not made for any more advanced tactics than 'sit &amp; take potshots'. This is not a problem unique to this game, both EA's Medal of Honor &amp; Ubisoft's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier has the exact same issue, and those games have level design that makes it far easier to exploit. Also, unlike in this games, I was not able to break any triggers by just moving too far ahead in CoD: Ghost.   Closing thoughts  CoD Ghost is not a terrible game, but it's not particularly good either. Many of the small non-standard shooting activities are over just as you'll start getting a feel for them, and the actual shooty bits are not as fun as they should have been, due to how the arenas are designed. The story is also really stupid, and inconsistent, and sadly not in a way that makes for prime popcorn action material. If you can get it for ~5-8â‚¬, it's worth a shot, if all you want is some mindless shooting, but at its asking price of 60â‚¬, even at 75% off, it's far too expensive. "

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity Ward really blew this game I feel it could have been so much more then it is. I bought it the week after it came out and even to this date you will never get into a server. 0.3/10 Stay away.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i have all call of duty and black ops games and its the same old same old full of hackers and they dont deal with them thanks very much
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Trash. Trash. Trash. Be smart and do not waste your money on this garbage. This game was released below alpha quality. Clearly it was unfinished work that was half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and pushed to the public. Squad mode is boring. Gameplay innovations are insignificant. Graphics engine is so poorly written that it makes powerful machines constantly drop in FPS. Even the menus stutter. This crap is pathetic. Activision thinks they can get away with robbing people and making them pay for trash. Do NOT waste your money on this garbage. Go to hell Activision.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've enjoyed this game so far, I really have and I want to play more but there are so many issues with the PC port, it's hard to tell anyone to spend money and buy this game. The main menu/options screen freezes randomly and has happened to many peoples systems, both Intel and AMD, no matter how good your hardware may be it doesn't seem to matter. While I haven't had the issue, I know many others have crashing/stuttering issues in-game as well.  Well lets get into some pros &amp; cons about the game.  Campaign: +Pros:  -Cons: - Story is possibly the weakest of all Call of Duty's - Voice acting is god awful and cringeworthy - Slow and dull, the 4 hour campaign makes it feel twice as long with half the fun as the older usual campaigns in comparison - A step backwards from Black Ops II, no custom loadouts, no side missions, no choices to be made. - Fish A.I doesn't seem to work all the time :/ - The dog 'Riley' they advertised so much is hardly in the campaign. Maybe 3-4 levels total and completely irrelevant.   Multiplayer +Pros: + Gunplay is good as usual + Plenty of soldier customization this time around, including female soldiers. + A far better gun and attachment unlock system + Improved prestige system + Kill time is faster which I enjoy a lot more. + Larger maps which I liked but some may not + New game modes are fun but unpopulated  -Cons: - Rank grindings take much longer - Unlocking soldier customization can be a pain -Spawn system is terrible - Less than a month after release and Multiplayer lobbies are nearly empty - New game modes are fun but unpopulated  Overall: +Pros: + Graphics look fairly nice on ultra, a bit better than Black Ops II but nothing too amazing + Gun sounds are good + Gamepad support  -Cons: - Volume options lacking - Lack of dedicated servers - No FoV slider or mouse smoothing on/off - Extinction game mode is rather boring (I don't like horde game modes usually including nazi zombies)  Game is rather average a 6.5/10 rating seems accurate for this title. You may have fun with this game but be weary you may end up wasting money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"  The most recent installment of the Call of Duty franchise, and without a doubt, the greatest farce offered up by Activision in this series yet  . This was the first Call of Duty I ever played on PC and seeing how it played out, there was no reason to buy it when I did (or for that matter, ever). I can say for certain that following this, I will  not  even do so much as consider purchasing another Call of Duty title on PC developed by Infinity Ward. Some games as well as previous Call of Duty titles are meant to be more user friendly and developed around lower end systems to pass on on graphical fidelity and instead aim for a more mechanics driven experience. Call of Duty Ghosts delivers neither of those two and instead falls on its stupid masked face.   Upon launch of the game back in 2013, it was a poor excuse for a console port to PC. No FoV options, pitiful graphics while consuming obscene amounts of system horsepower while running terribly, ridiculous system requirements (seriously, you need 50GB of my disk space for this rubbish?), gun play that feels 'meh' at best, and God awful multiplayer level design.  I'll admit, there are some interesting aspects. It's nice to see the 'Pick 10' system still  somewhat  in place, but not nearly as well designed as Treyarch's version. Certain weapons coming with integrated attachments is a neat thing, albeit with a rather narrow selection of weapons to choose from. Though this doesn't help that the aforementioned gun play is rather boring, and no gun I ever tried had significant  oomph  to it to make me feel as if I am using more than some dinky airsoft gun from a corner store.  All that sounds bad for the most part, I know. But you know what sounds worse? The actual game. Call of Duty Ghosts has no doubt, the absolute  WORST  sound design in any shooter I have ever played. It's absolutely pathetic. Half the guns seem to sound the same, and I wouldn't mind that if they at least had some depth to the sound. But every gun sounds like you put a rock in a tin can and shook it around! In fact, that would sound BETTER than half the guns in this abysmal game.  You know what else is bad? The level design for multiplayer. I don't know what they were thinking with the pacing of the maps, but I'm pretty sure their minds were obscured by a bit of LSD. The flow of combat in the maps is terrible, and movement feels sluggish and boring. Back in MW2, the movement speed was perfect for the map size and the maps were the right size to begin with. But now we're constantly being given tiny maps compared to what used to be the norm, and to make sure you can't do a lap of them in five seconds you now move painfully slow. Not to mention the maps are organized in a way that makes as much logical sense as using molasses as libricant in your car's engine. And I hope you don't mind respawning within 15 meters of an enemy at all times thanks to the awful spawning system.  Now, the Extinction mode. I'll admit, it looks kinda cool. One of the better co-op experiences done by Infinity Ward for sure, and for the Call of Duty franchise it's certainly something new. But is it a good new? Eh... I'll leave that up to the individual to decide. If I'm going into a co-op shooting gallery, aliens aren't high up on my list of preferred bullet pin cushions. Though I'll award a few pity points for trying to do something with this game in at least one category.  On the subject of the Single Player... I'll admit, I didn't touch it. Let's face it, year after year, people buy into Call of Duty for the multiplayer. If I want a lush and deep single player game, I'll look to a game that is designed around the concept of a blissful single player experience. Knowing how this game is though, I can imagine that the campaign was rather lackluster at best if not a poor excuse for a tacked on side game mode for when you ragequit the online multiplayer. And Squads? I'm just gonna ignore that... It falls within the realm of the online multiplayer, and that mode is a joke in just about every regard.  So in conclusion; this game is not worth your time or your dollars, euros, rubles, or freaking Dogecoins if you somehow managed to obtain this game using them. The game runs poorly, simple features that should have been present at launch were not to be seen, the game looks like a dated console port that has way too much brown in the colour pallete, the multiplayer is the worst experience to date, the sound in game is nearly gag worthy,  and more  while taking up FIFTY GIGABYTES of your monthly internet bandwidth and 50GB of space on your hard drive. It's a waste of space, a waste of time, and a waste of money. Want a good PvP shooter experience? Go buy Titanfall! If you don't want to use Origin's service (I don't blame you there), and you still want to go buy something... Go buy six copies of Goat Simulator and gift five of them to your friends. They will love you for it. Otherwise, avoid this game like the bubonic plague.  Game Rating: 3.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It had to happen eventually, and for IW/Activision it couldn't have been at a worse time.  For a game that was supposed to ring in the new console generation with a bang and kick off a series to outbest Modern Warfare, Ghosts brings a sickening amount of issues, terrible design choices, and lack of innovation (even for such a stagnant series like Call of Duty).  Texture issues, random frame rate drops, lighting and shadow glitches, and even audio problems plague every inch of this game. Graphically, Ghosts looks on par if not worse than Modern Warfare 3 and somehow manages to run terribly. And why can I play the campaign on near max settings but have to revert to the lowest in the multiplayer? I don't know and I don't think IW does either.  The singeplayer campaign is nothing special, a mish-mash of the worst parts of Modern Warfare and Black Ops 2 with a healthy dose of even less 'innovation' and proper storytelling and emotion than any Call of Duty game before it. The only new things this game even manages to bring to the table are the contextual lean (something not even needed on the PC version) and the freakin' dog they hyped up so much that proves to be just as much of a lame gimmick pre as post-release.  And the multiplayer - the one aspect that convinced most to crack open their wallets every year - is HORRENDOUS.  Aside from the aforementioned oddity with the online portion's graphics, all the maps save one or two are ill-designed and way too big for this kind of multiplayer game, you'll find yourself spawning amongst enemy teammates more than once a match, as of two weeks ago (when I stopped playing altogether) IW had yet to nail down hacks and exploits, the kill streak system feels gutted and useless, and the ranking/unlock system is so unnecessarily convoluted that even Call of Duty veterans will have to fumble around the menus, within menus, within menus before figuring it out.  Call of Duty: Ghosts is just a less than mediocre showing from the series and unless you absolutely, positively need your new COD fix take a pass on this one and see if next year's installment looks or is any better."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,The horror!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why did I buy this? This game is not a fun game. It is not even a good game. It is CoD, but it's worse. I would rather eat used tampons than play another minute of this atrocity."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"These are just my thoughts written down in 10 minutes, excuse grammar, or spelling mistakes, i tried to avoid the most of them. I might exaggerate my expressions, but principally this fits to my attitude towards this game in every point.  - Lagg compensation, makes players seeing you 1-2 seconds earlier than you can see them, of course you will lose the gunfight because of that.  - Bad map design: they look pretty, if you could run the game flawlessly. Moreover and most important the maps are way to big, which forces players with lower gunskill or inferior tactics to camp, through the whole game on one spot. This forced playstyle has huge influence on the course of the game. To be more detailed, this map design makes the action running slower, and basically having less fun, cause you die on a streak because of a guy in his tent, cooking some food. This playstyle forces a player to pay more attention, attention which makes you to put huge effort into looking at every spot.  - Unbalanced weapons: This over defensive playstyle is supported with some overpowered weapons, some shotguns are to strong in mods like cranked, and small parts of maps. These small areas are used as camping spots, where players are going on patrol with their shotguns. IEDs help the player to be safe in their camping areas, IEDs are replacing bouncing betties and claymores in one not dodgeable equipment. Everyone is using the same weapons for a reason, probably the ak-12 is the most used weapon in the game, autosnipers, which oneshot you like more difficult snipers, the vector machinepistole which can kill you across the whole map, with even less shots than a assault rifle, and the mentioned shotguns.  - Perk system: Actually you need to run specialist, to have the essential perks that are needed to win gunfights, surviving sound whoring guys, which is, and can be used as another camping tactic, explosives and flashbangs. At all getting to a higher killstreak. Even though running specialist is closely enough to provide you with a balanced basic and same requirements to play against other players.  - Laggs: Due to bad programming or a sophisticated marketing strategy, to make the player buy new hardware make the feeling even worse, decent hardware is not enough anymore to run the game flawlessly.  - Worst Anti-cheat ever: In the last days I have seen one up to three cheaters, who enjoyed their games with their rage settings, killing you with a headshot through 6 walls, or their legit settings, which correct their aims when they are near to the part where they want to shoot at. They can't be asked to use a wallhack, it is more of a foundation nowadays on call of duty ghosts.  - Matchmaking system: It feels like there is no system behind the matchmaking, dicing out the teams, no matter which level they are or which kill/death ratio they have, so the game is usually decided before it even started.Once you left a game, because of a hacker, or because you don't give it a chance, you accepted that you will get one lose for it. So you search again, now it is your turn to guess, which game you will join.  - Spawn system: If players tell you, that people are spawning in a circle around them, might be an exaggeration but there is some truth behind it. Your Killstreaks are often ended by People spawning arbitrary in your face or 10 centimeters behind your back. Once you are dead, you will probably die 2-3 times again, because your next spawn will be at 3 enemy players who directly kill you, again and again.  The gameplay is more sophisticating than in earlier cod's, more tactical, just because of the lower amount of bullets players can stand. Sadly this improvement gets disturbed by all these mentioned facts. Ghosts prevents you from having a constant, liquid competitive gaming, which in the end, arouses fun to you.  There might be some well done realized concepts, and I have fun at the game sometimes, but weighing up all the pros and cons on a gold balance, the cons just outweigh the pros. And that I do not forget to mention, i see alot of potential in this game, but it needs to be realized, work needs to be done for this, we will see if that will happen."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Goods :  - Extinction And SQUAD mode are fun to play  The Bads  - Stupid single player story, barely functional - Same multiplayer for years - Graphics does not keep up with the next gen  Overall : 2/10 in my opinion  EDIT : If you like to buy good game, then SKIP ghosts."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,stabbing yourself in the balls and poking out your eyes is more fun than this game...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Total waste of money money and time !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The worst Call of Duty as of yet. I deeply regret this purchase. PC optimization is really bad, the gameplay is unfun due to really low Playerhealth (The Dog Killstreak has around double the health of the player) and it generally does not feel like an Infinity Ward Call of Duty at all. I might be a bit influenced due to my coundless hours in the Modern Warfare titles, but this is definitely a bad game. Get one of the Modern Warfare titles or Black Ops 2 if that's your thing, but  don't buy this game . Not even on sale or for five bucks. Spend your money on good games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Have a very poweful PC, waited 5 months for optimisations. barely playable now at time of writing. Game is hacked beyond belief and spawn camping is a major issue. Aimbots everywhere and xray vision is apparent in atleast half of games joined. If youre looking for a good game, this isnt it. wasted money, wasted time, wasted life....... Dont even spare a thought for the game, only thing that it has is that it does look nice. Next-gen nice......not quite, maybe late previous gen, but no more. Want a recomendation, pre-oder watchdogs, Darksouls 2, or play Assassins Creed 4. Those games are worth your time and money. NOT THIS. we need to put an end to the COD franchise, or show that they need to release a good game, not garbage year upon year and get away with it. Send em down under.  Edit: At the time of writing, they had released a PC update improving texture quality (didnt appreciate the 2gb download tho) but coming up to the next COD game and there is still major performance issues, yet, they are still releasing DLC??? wtf is wrong with this company, even EA can publish and deliver games better than this and theyre EA ffs. I could have such a rage over this, but im just gonna let my 40 quid slide into a black hole evidently. Utterly dissappointed, if the next COD is the same garbage, i will make a contract with someone stating i will never buy anoother COD game. EVER."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Oprah once said for this game 'Check under your seats, open the box.' then everyone opened the box and then said 'You get a crash... You get a crash... Yes you even get a crash!' True story."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bad game, COD franchise is now cancer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hot Stinky Pile of PooPoo
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst game ever, waste of money and time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Best game since -insert name here- 10/10 would play Black Ops 2 again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As much as I enjoyed the gameplay and storyline of this game, the PC version is an absolute mess. If you hate dealing with FPS drops, frame loss, texture tearing/flickering, random mouse acceleration and a community full of modders and hackers, give this one a WIDE berth. COD on PC is dead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Easily the worst PC port of a game I've ever played. Terrible and inconsistent performance on a GTX670, DX11 features cripple the already low frame rate and cause insane amounts of mouse lag. The game seems to have a problem with high DPI/high polling rate gaming mice since crosshair movement becomes smooth and consistent when using a controller. The lack of an FOV slider is downright idiotic, especially following on from the comparitively well optimised Black Ops 2. Prettier shaders than BO2, but ultimately not much of a visual upgrade at all.   For some reason IW have elected to throw Treyarch's design ideals out of the window and created boxy, large maps with no 'lanes' and no real flow to them. Spawns have a random feel taking any semblance of control and pacing out of the matches. It's very clear that the game has no competitive aspirations, which is fine, but it doesn't make sense following on the heals of Black Ops 2. Could be good for quick, dumb fun if the optimisation didn't completely get in the way.   Oh and the fish AI was a lie."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wasn't going to review this game until it was fixed, but seeing as it's on sale and many might want to buy it, as well as the fact that it's been almost two months and the game shows no signs of improving, I made an exception. Long story short, Do not buy this. The game is terribly optimized, I only get around 30-40 on my rig and it even drop to 20 in some areas. Extra is unplayable for most people. Crashes for NVIDIA users are constant, for example, whenever I play whiteout for about 5 minutes it immediately crashes the display driver, and with AMD, it's nothing but corrupted textures on things like tractors, trucks and even some guns, making it unplayable for them.   As for the gameplay, it's shockingly bad, balance is horrible with Assault Rifles and SMG's being the only practical weapons with all others only useful for playing around. The MSBS kills in 0.056 seconds while most other weapons need 0.140, weapons with built in attachments like the Honey Badger invalidate any other weapon not doing the same. The Riot Shield is completely broken with users being able to shoot through your shield completely or just shooting the bottom of the shield and the hit detection thinking they shot your foot, and on top of that, weapons actually do more damage when shooting someone's feet, the same as the Headshot multiplier.   If you think you can get past all of that for some CoD action, proceed with caution. Probably the biggest reason not to buy this is the lack of any anti-cheat, be it VAC or Punkbuster. Hackers and cheaters are abundant. In almost every lobby I have joined, my first or second one has always had at least one. This is literally killing the game, and it's numbers show, If you don't like team deathmatch or domination you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of luck, because there are no players in any other playlist, and dom is only even populated during the US daytime.   In my opinion, Call of Duty Ghosts is this year's Blunder Of The Year. Some will point and say, 'What about Colonial Marines, what about Ride to Hell?' Now let me ask you, did anyone ever expect those to be good? Colonial marines was in development hell for at least 6 years, and Ride to Hell was made by the guys who make Nascar games. This was a major AAA release with a development cost of several hundred millions of dollars, and this isn't even playable, not even 2 months after release. Avoid at all costs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldn't recomend this game for it's price. The story line was pretty bad.. There was hardly any character development and the character development was uninteresting and not worth wasting time on. The multiplayer is terrible. I haven't got any DLC's because of how bad the matchmaking is so i cannot say all the maps are bad. But they mostly are. They're isn't any map that stands out-they're all pretty bad. And to add to that. You spawn in. Start running and 2 seconds later get killed by an enemy who flanked round the back of you. Nothing you can do.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not optimized for PC at all. What a dissapointment. This game ended my love for the Call of Duty franchise. I am not a fanboy of anything. I play games that are enjoyable. This was a way for the company to steal from their customers. What a horrible experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lag. Glitching. Dubious players who some claim to be hackers sure are close to showing it. Starting out now in April 2015 is asking for punishment: no low level matches as you will be put in with a lot of maxed out players who know maps and weapons back to front. This is a very unforgiving, very poorly optimised game, even though I bought it for $15 it still feels a real waste of money. TOO many negative reviews for this on varied websites; my fault clearly for not heeding.  Got to level 9, uninstalled. No more. Lag compensation is killing this. I tried with my high speed ethernet cable in, and out on wi-fi but still, I am watching killcams of me just sitting there 0.5 -1.0 seconds seeing the enemy later than he sees me, and that means 90% of the time I die before I even get to pull the trigger.   The WORST CoD MP experience from the first to this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best.Game.Ever for you people who love AAA games : - bad Story Line (I don't get every single damn mission) - not only war on earth but also on space? It makes no sense - lol, bad ending (?) - $59.99, 30GBs, and time are wasted for this game, it's great to have business with you guys - multiplayers are bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ts. I can't even find a player alive there (Limited servers?) - most of the DLCs are useless, its good for people who loves wasting money though - i don't see any 'REFUND' button here - i think i'm going to play goat simulator rather than this.  10/10 the worst of all AAA games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recommend you wait to buy the game until all its quirks are fixed, right now it takes too much tweaking, even with required equipment and more. I am having crashing issues that are rather random and make no sense.  I do reccomend that if you have already bought it, you might as well play it! read the guides! make sure you have everything updated, you should be able to play it with some tweaking. Overall, it's shameful how PC players get treated by companies like infinity ward that make no bones about making console games now, in fact the whole COD franchise is becoming pretty much a console game and because of that you will loose some of the better players COD will ever have. This game will make you have panic attacks constantly not quite the adrenalin rush I was hoping for."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! YOU CAN'T EVEN WIPE YO â™¥â™¥â™¥ WITH THIS GAME BECAUSE IT IS DIGITAL! 0/10 S.O.T.Y
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are planning to play campaign only, go for it - it's actually pretty good but if you are looking for a atleast decent multiplayer experience or anything else, don't buy it's super bad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"one of the worst versions of cod ... am so disappointed!! there is no word to describe this game, i can only say 'big fail'  not worth to spend 1$ on this shi** game  full of hackers like mw3 and reporting them useless ..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The meta score doesn't do this game justice. I pre-ordered the entire thing, and boy do I wish I could get my 100+ dollars back. The first 3 months they let hackers run rampid and did nothing about them or the way the game ran entirely like poo. They redeemed some of their name by adjusting the game some, it runs half way decent. It was advertised as a dedicated server game yet if you play it enough you'll find out different. They left the ping feature that is one of the most important parts of online gaming out. No ping bars, no ping number. It's simply that they didn't want you to see that you were connecting to some russian host with over 300 ms of latency. This game is pure trash! Test your ping to ANY Russian server, you'll see what I'm talking about. This cannot and will never be able to be over come with lag compensation. They claim they are delivering the best experience, pft more like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ peoples wallets for regurgitated crap. K.E.M. Strike is the same as a M.O.A.B. as is the same as a Nuke. 3 generations of cod games with this blow everything additude that decent players have a hard time getting yet you see people doing it left and right because it's too easy for them to download scripts. Making the bridge between a Cheater and a Great player be almost null and void. New graphics engine? Right, let everyone know you made the game to run on 4k yet you failed to compress the textures so it takes up 4 gigs of space on a graphics card to run it. Some of the top tier graphics cards don't even run this game maxed, because of lazy development. Seriously, anyone that bought this game needs half their money back for only getting a half â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Falsely advertised as on a dedicated server, I've seen multiple times a migration for peer host. The sheer amount of people that seemly pick this game up and run circles around avid good gamers is tremendous. Its rediculous that you can view their steam profile and the only games they have any time to speak of are these p2p cods. There is a reason they run around with 4.0's in these games and not one of them do all that well in any server based games. It's because they can and will use hacks in p2p games that can't be detected. Activision and Infinity Ward should appologize to pc gamers for this game. Vac is good but not perfect. Even in these games Vac allows the person to cheat way too long and while the community waits for these hackers to be banned they lose patience and these games die out."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even worse than Mw3. The game REQUIRES Directx 11 to even start, so if you haven't upgraded your graphics card in a while, I wouldn't bother. It also needs a huge 50 gigs worth of hard drive space to install, for 'High Res Textures' which frankly look the same as back from Mw3.    I went into Ghosts thinking that maybe, just MAYBE, the multiplayer would have gotten better, but was very disappointed. There are these random moments where your FPS is just fine, and then it randomly drops for no reason. There are no dedicated servers, and the killstreaks are ridiculous. But to be honest I expected terrible things like that.    The main reason I bought Ghosts was for the single player. I've enjoyed the CoD campaigns, even though most are just mindless point A to point B, killing along the way. I started the sp campaign, only to find terrible stuttering through the opening loading screen. Lag so bad you could only hear every other word he was saying. I persevered, thinking it was just having trouble loading the game and the movie at the same time. After about 10 minutes of the choppiest audio I've ever heard, it was done loading and I began the intro...only to find that it also lagged incredibly, to the point of unplayability. I turned the settings down all the way, and it made it even worse!   TL;DR: This game is poorly optimized, and just in general very bad. A truly terrible console port."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I gotta say.. I'm very dissappointed in Infinity Ward.. This was honestly one of the worst CoD games ever made.. It's port is awful, there are hackers in nearly every game, not to mention the game runs so poorly on my computer, which can run BF4 on Ultra settings with no lag whatsoever.. No I do not recommend this game, wait for Treyarch's next game, or better yet just buy BO2. This game really needs to be updated so it can actually be playable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,-Lack of optimalization -Taking 60 GB of hard drive !?!?!!? -BAJILIONS OF HACKERS -Very short campaign (with stupid plot) -6 GB of ram ?!?!?!  All of these makes this game an abomination.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So. I bought it. I should have spent money elsewhere. Activisiion states in their email 'fans have spoken, Ghost is the best CoD to date'. On a console, maybe, meybe. I still doubt it. I never cared about campaign in any CoD, its the Multiplayer that holds atleast some of my interest. So I could care less about SP... Now for the MP. On paper it looks nice, very nice. In reality it's Modern warfare 3.5 .With better visuals, character customisation and slightly better weapon balance. That's it. Also the thing to mention, the one developer responsible for the spawn algorythm should be shot on sight. The system is so bad, that Black ops 2 system looks just about perfect, and it had flaws. Now I'll mention bad things about the game and good things:  Good things: pretty balanced weapons, medium size maps(large if you played Black ops 2), nice visuals, wepons also feel pretty alive, they kick and you can really feel the weight behind it.  Bad things: maps are too large for standart 8v8, terrible, terrible spawn system, no ping is shown, so you don't know why the game lags like shtako, still pretty bad optimisation, possible cheaters, (kinda strange to see insta turns and aiming through walls), poor anti-cheat, rapidly declining player base. (10k people on weekend? Black ops 2 had even more on weekdays)  So in contrast how I liked and enjoyed Black ops 2, even if it had issues with weapon balance( I am looking at you smg's) I can't really paraise this game. Even though it is much more tactical thatn Black ops 2, and promotes cautious play, even camping, and has good moments its nothing that amazing that you can't get from Modern warfare 3. So if you own Modern warfare 3 and can get games without cheaters( who have declined rapidly, as I observed, moved to other games perhaps) you are NOT missing that much. It is not as revolutionary as Black ops 2, and also if you like brainless smg running you will be dissapointed.  This game could have been great, but in reality is is certainly not."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BEWARE OF IT'S SALE!!! DO NOT FALL FOR IT LIKE I DID!!!  Okay... I will give a fair review of the game itself. This game overall is spectacular. I own it on PS4 and I love it especially the extinction mode. Campaign was phenomenal, the new extinction mode was so addicting and awesome. Multiplayer was decent and fun with the dlc's such as becoming Michael Myers and the Predator by doing the field order challenges. I still enjoy this game to this day on the PS4 and wanted to carry on the same experience to the PC to play with my PC buds.   Unfortunately this is such a terrible PC port. It's performance overall is mediocre. It runs good for me but lacks gamepad overall even with keybinding since it moves completely slow and the same to look around. I tried using my wired 360 xbox controller which works like a charm on my other games and it seems like the game has partial support for gamepads overall. I even tried using my PS4 and Xbox controller on ScpServer and Xpadder and none of these seemed to work. I know I have no issues with Xpadder cause I can play CoD4 with my controller without a problem. A great game overall and great development for the consoles, but poor development for the PC. I also tried to verify integrity of the game's cache and optimizing it on my nvidia geforce experience as my last resort to see if that would improve it's performance and nothing. It's quite a shocker cause I have games like Battlefield 4 and Titanfall both with higher specs and works flawlessly and I even had Advanced Warfare at one point and was running very well. However, I do recommend the game for the console versions only. DO NOT waste your money for the PC version. You've been WARNED!! They would need to come up with a major update for the PC to fix the whole game to bring it back to life and to fully operate how it should to be able to recommend it. Otherwise, it's just NOT worth it. I'm so upset and I want my money back."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game ruined my life
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Before you read the positive reviews, please take note of the hours played for each of them. Less than 10 hours of game play is not an experienced opinion. At 110 hours, expectations that I had for the improvement of this game have all but evaporated. After noticing that my submissions for major improvements over hacking, a failed Clan War system, and more were answered on average 10+ days later, I was compelled to write this review.  Game Balance = Fail Clan Wars = Fail Graphics = Fail Administration = Fail Single Player = Win Extinction = Win Squad = Win  Translation: Co-op and single player modes are awesome. Multiplayer plays like it was developed by the same contractors that were building the building that collapsed in advance of the Brazil Olympics.  CLAN WARS: Clan Wars should have saved this game, and in fact, there was an uptick in players logging in. But as soon as the boosting and the exploiting started, despite the many posts, the admins failed to respond.  OVERALL MAJOR BUGS: In addition to the terrible balancing of games, the FPS and Memory for PC is all over the place. There is a huge mem leak at this time of my review, and how many weeks after release is this? How things like these made it into a tested game is unacceptable, and people should be accountable/lose their jobs.  Ping balance- you will play against people from the farthest reaches of the world, with both of you changing places for smooth to sloggy game play. There seems to be a problem with the way the game throttles and balances individual connectivity. Along with that, I dont understand how it makes sense to pair your lobby in the US with FR, Poland, and etc...unless they are just having a really hard time matching games....because...at 9pm PST the other night the entire system had less than 5,000 players.....  RAMPANT CHEATING A poorly admined game that requires you to play on their servers means that they will fix what they want when they want. Call of Duty will never be free of hacking and cheats, but this is by far the worst administered game ever.  From my experience and for my opinion, this is the worst online game I have ever bought. I wish refunds were possible."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'll be judging this game on a multiple factors, them being: Graphics, Performance, Gameplay, Enjoyment and community   Starting with Graphics:   The game doesn't look anything special, I honestly don't know if it's running on a new engine or not, I just can't see a major difference between Ghosts and Black ops 2   Performance:   Now's the funny part, as stated in the graphics section it's nothing special, but it's performance is even worse than it's graphics, it performs horribly:  -FPS drops -low fps throughout the game -crashes and errors -it uses over 3gb of ram during multiplayer  3GB of ram is being used on a game like call of duty, comedy gold.   Gameplay:  I didn't see any difference, it's just the same game with different guns and different maps.   Enjoyment:  While many people enjoyed ghosts, I didn't, I just didn't find anything special about it, every round I played felt the same, the map-changing features are nothing but low-quality Grade-F Bologna.   Community:  Nothing much to write here as it's pretty much obvious, the game is flooded with underaged kids(some with mics) and adults that act like kids(that's just sad), while this is more of an external factor in comparison to the rest, it still maintains a role in influencing on enjoyment and gameplay of the game.  This concludes my first review, Don't buy this, even if your PC is of the strongest you will have performance issues, that's just how the game was made.    Disclaimer:   I am not a Call of Duty Hater nor am I a Battlefield fanboy, I have always maintained a neutral side between the two franchises."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED! this game is a piece of SH*T.. NO DEDICATED SERVER AT ALL.. TOTALLY RELIES ON PLAYER HOSTING resulting to horendous HOST MIGRATION in almost every game! THE DELAY IS HORRIBLE!, GAME GRAPHICS STUTTERS LIKE H*LL!. They released an unfinished game, its like an experiment for them, better skip this one and wait for the next release of COD, hopefully they will not make the same mistake! SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please don't waste your money, it is by far the worst Call of Duty game they have ever made, these so called 'next-gen visuals-' are far from it on max settings on PC, they have removed pretty much every hardcore gamemode apart from the campfests and its just downright terrible. You want your multiplayer fix with real next-gen graphics, go see Battlefield 4!  *UPDATE* Don't even buy BF4 because that's a full priced beta test, the game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mess!! Don't buy either, they are both wank!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unoptimalized piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. My gaming computer well exceeded all the requirements, yet the game managed to make itself average to around 15-20 fps. Pretty much the same as every other CoD game, I recommend against buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Beautiful to see how this franchise is dieing. and Activision does not give one simple f*ck about it ,nor do they about their community. GG Activision, have fun milking every single cent out of this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Such Duty Much bombastic Very multiplayer  Uh...Wow?   5/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i wouldnt recommend this game on steam because lag/fps dropping and its definitley not the best cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yey! New Stacey Malibu! This is the same Stacey Malibu, but she has a new hat this time!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I prefer black ops 2, the new advance warfare aswell, this really isn't worth the price."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was pretty disappointed when I purchased this game. I had bought it, then read the forums when it was installing. This left me with a sour, bitter taste in my mouth. All the negativity reguarding this game, and understandibly so. The multiplayer is god awful. It is to the point where i have tried everything to get it to run smoothly but, at this point, it seems impossible. However, the single player is great. The story pulled me in and I couldn't stop playing. So here are some pro's and con's:  Pro: -The campaign was pretty good and ran remarkebly well.  Cons: -Campaign is insanely short ~5 hours -Multiplayer is laggy, buggy and stuttery -Lack of play base (see above) -$60 price tag (maybe worth $30 tops)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very bad game has ended after a series of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Call of Duty Ghost copy and paste from black ops 2 failed
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The most expensive, high-requeriments, COD 4: MW mod I have ever seen."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sorry to say another cod flop they seem to be getting worse not better guess I'll keep on playing BF4 to remind myself how a good game plays.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I myself do not reccomend this game. Where should i start? The game has way to high system requirements for the quality it produces. Game optimization on PC is horrible, You are forced to download a FOV tool if you play with higher than a 65 FOV. Poor Game Customization, The setting are hard to work through, I had too look up where most of my settings were. Multiplayer, I have seen 1-2 hacker's at MOST in Call of Duty : Black Ops 2, I have seen more than 20 hackers and more than 10 hacked lobby's a month into the game. Patches, They do not address the bugs, glitches and game optimization issues on the PC at all, We have had patches so far that do nothing. Customizing your classes, You have a hard time picking what your class loadout is because of a ridiculous menu lag that will lag you from leaving lobbys, changing characters, and your classes. Servers, There is no dedicated servers at all, So if the host is running the game on a very bad computer with a very bad connection the match is laggy, virtually unplayable. FOV Tool, You need a 3rd party FOV tool to play the game so you do not get sick or get headaches!? Startup, Constant Crashes when you load a map, or if you are in the middle of a match you randomly lose connection to steam and crash. Stats, As for almost the first 2 weeks people were feared of being banned for the FOV tool, You would have bad stats initialy for the locked 65 FOV. There is no way that is known of reseting your stats at the current time or probaly will never be in the current future. My rating for this game is a [3/10]."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I fervently REGRET purchasing this game, and DO NOT recommend it to anyone who is looking for fair, legitimate, and competitive online gameplay.  I have been an avid COD fan over the years, starting all the way back with COD 2. I have purchased virtually every new release--whether from Treyarch or IW--with the almost sole intention of playing multiplayer. Sadly, Ghosts is where I stop; this is indisputably the last COD I will ever purchase.  Why? It's simple: the developers' blatant disregard for online playability, neglect (or perhaps unwillingess) to ramp up anti-hack measures/ban cheaters, and complete inability to optimize the game for computers of varying capabilities all serve to undermine the integrity of the entire COD franchise.  First, in online multiplayer on PC, there are hardly ANY players online. The only two game modes you're guaranteed to find matches in are TDM and Domination. What's the point in having all the cool niche game modes if there aren't enough players online using them?  Okay, so let's look at the cause-effect: why aren't there any players online? It really comes down to two main reasons. The first is that the game is poorly optimized, and is consequently only playable by those with top-tier PCs. 'Just decrease the visual settings', you suggest? Ah, if we purchase a game for $60, should we really have to downgrade the quality settings to play it? No. The developers are generating millions of profit at significant margins; why should WE have to compromise game quality when they have the means and resources to optimize the game to ensure playability for a diversity of consumers?  Fortunately, I have a high-performing PC and do not experience (the majority) of the lag/fps issues that most complain about. Instead, my biggest issue and disappointment is the ridiculous prevalance of hackers. There are AT LEAST 2-3 hackers in almost every single online match. If you take the time to watch killcams of many top-scoring players, a pathetically high number of them are, quite conspicuously, aiming at you through walls/map barriers. Some are even stupid enough to SHOOT you through walls, even regardless of whether you have all stealth perks active or not (i.e. blind eye, incog, off the grid).   I understand COD is a franchise especially prone to hacking--that's fine, that's to be expected. However, the sheer influx of hackers in COD: Ghosts is just completely sad. Of the 5-6 different COD chapters I've played, this is bar-none the worst for hacking. It is quite evident that Activision/IW/whoever's responsible for anti-hack measures have completely floundered. Until cheaters begin to get caught and banned (which likely won't be for a LONG while), I assuredly will not be playing much. In its current state, the quality of online gameplay is shameful, and yields a considerably frustrating experience for those who want to play fairly and legitimately."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Smelly game.  * No graphics tweaks, looks worse than the older games  * â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ players  * Bad drama  *I cri erry tiem"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do yourselves a huge favor and don't buy this game.  'Call Of Duty - Ghosts: Where skill doesn't matter, low ping is everything and where your expensive top-tier PC build is irrelevant!'  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer:  Call of Duty: Ghosts is the 10th game in CoD series. Iâ€™ve been playing Call of Duty for 5 years now and I liked most of them. But this game is really bad. This game looks almost the same as MW2/3 which are games of more than 2 years ago. IW decided to go to take the safe path, since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was their biggest success, they made all prequels more or less the same. So most IW games lack innovation. Also the amount of hackers is ridiculous. In MW2, MW3 were a lot of hackers despite the fact of the anti-cheat system IW claimed to have installed. In Black Ops 2 there was not a single hacker I encountered in the time I played the multiplayer. But after having played Ghosts one week there were already signs of wallhackers and people using aimbots. Itâ€™s really frustrating to encounter hackers after having played a game without hackers for almost a year. Call of Duty is also infamous for their unbalanced/overpowered weapons. This time the guns are not that unbalanced however the I.E.D. makes me want to throw my computer out of the window. It is something similar to the bouncing betty but itâ€™s hardly spottable. After youâ€™ve heard it trigger youâ€™re assured to explode within a few seconds. You also got a dog which has 2 times the health of a human player. It can jump on you from a distance of 5 meter and youâ€™ll die as soon as it jumps on you. There is no animation or anything you just die instantly when he jumps. Is there something positive about Ghosts? Why, yes there is. The maps are much bigger than in BO2. So the game wonâ€™t end up in spawnraping. But then again IW ruined it by its ridiculous spawns. For example when my team got the A and B Flag in domination and the enemy team got only the C flag there are really high chances that the enemy will still spawn at A or B. This is why using specialist or assault strike package is not recommended.   Singleplayer:  The missions in the singleplayer were okay. It could have been better but I did enjoy it for the bigger part. The missions are pretty cool and the campaignâ€™s intro is one of the most beast intros Iâ€™ve ever played in a FPS game. This campaign, though, is one of the easiest campaigns Iâ€™ve ever played in the CoD series. It wasnâ€˜t much of a challenge. When you almost died you had plenty of time to run towards cover and regenerate health, even on Veteran Difficulty. There is, however, one thing I donâ€™t like about the campaign which is the fact it has an open ending. This means IW wants to continue this series in a prequel which will probably be â€œGhosts 2â€ or something like that. I really fear IW will make another game that is almost the same again.   Extinction:  I was really looking forwards to this new gamemode. But it wasnâ€™t as I expected. I enjoyed playing it as long we didnâ€™t complete the whole mission. As soon as we completed Extinction it wasnâ€™t all that fun anymore because it became repetitive. So thatâ€™s a real shame.    Verdict: 2/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lags on gtx760 with normal settings, some joke:D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont buy it it sucks so hard
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I find that this is the worst Call of Duty I have played, these are the reasons for my opinion:  1. Terrible optimisation for PC, I have a good PC and I still can't even run it on high when I could run BO2 maxed out. 2. It doesn't have very many new features, becomes boring very quickly. 3. It has a lot of bugs that ruin the game experience. 4. Lack of dedicated servers so there is a quite a lot of hackers. 5. Poorly designed maps.  Updated review (30/10/2014)  1. Optimisation has improved a lot. I can now run it maxed out with a stable, 60+ fps. 2. Extra graphic features added for Nvidia graphics cards. 3. Still major mouse/input lag. 4. FOV changer implemented in-game. 5. FPS still capped at 90. 6. Very small player base, last time I checked only ~2,000 people currently online."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"kind of weak, not recommended yet"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,They tried hard but didn't quite make it. Nice graphics but not optimized for PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So disappointed, this game is disgusting stay well away from this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  I have 4-5 hours played on this game it is absolute bunk."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,People need to stop hyping CoD game. They are never to your expectations.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Softcore = hardcore. Terrible maps. Bad game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy i regret buying this game and want my money back
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is emptier than the soul of a 40 year old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It shall be called  Call of Trash: Crash   One of my worst investments I've ever made. Game crashes after awhile, sometimes after 2 hours sometimes after 15 minutes. Everything tested. Also i have the half of the FPS i had in MW3... this is one of the  worst console to pc port ever made "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not sure what Infinity Ward was thinking when they made a 60 GB game and a game that's lagging like hell for everyone, I got a good PC but I do get lag spikes really often comparing to BO2.  Add Mod Tools and Rentable servers for PC and I'm sure you will get players back, I'm still sticking to the older CoDs or waiting for the next Treyarch game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I gave into the hype and I bought this game on the first day that it came out. Throughly disappointed in every way: typical Call of Duty game with a rushed and kill-without-thought story and uninteresting multiplayed. Completed the campaign in 6.6 hours. 2/10 because my dog could pounce on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the worst cod I've ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't usualy write reviews, however I thought I would save people some time and money. This game is the worst creation known to man, it's been moved from the consoles to pc, and they've done such a terrible job. They can't even optimize it so a menu doesn't have fps lag, even on the lowest settings. Let alone have a good fps in a match. The Call of Duty series has yet again been proved to be a cash cow and nothing else, these games should be a peice of art, not something that is unplayable. The single player campaign was just the same as all of the other Call of Duty's, just run and pull the trigger at anything that moves, some may find this bareable, and this is not the main flaw in this game. The main flaw is the multiplayer,I've spent more time trying to connect to the online serices than I have actually played on mulitplayer, and i'm sure it's not my interent as Black ops 2 works straight away. Once I do manage to get online, I can't bare to play more than five minutes, bullets don't seem to hit people, there's a lot of fps lag and all of the features such as dynamic maps just aren't really there. To conclude I feel that this is the biggest waste of money ever, if you want a Call of Duty game, I would suggest Black Ops 2 or MW2, DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON GHOSTS. I would rate this game 1/10, it's barely playable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Way too much Delays, the spawns are terrible. The fact that they removed Search and Destroy, Capture the Flag and Hardpoint which are great compedative gamemodes is way beyond me! Did NOT include rentable servers and LISTED SERVERS which is one of the bases of PC gamer communities!!! Question for Infinity ward: Why do you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over the PC-gamers!? They had and still have locked FOV on 65!!! Did you not learn ANYTHING from the game Black Ops 2!? The amount of cheaters in the game is HORRIFIC! Another problem who would have been much less of a problem with LISTED SERVERS, where active community members can ban all player with Vac Bans and also the ones that clearly cheats! All in all, so far this game has been a DISASTER for the PC-gaming communities. I will NEVER buy a new COD title if they don't clean up the mess they made with this game.  So far I feel like I WASTED all the money I put into the game and the seasonpass!  Thank you Infinityward for this Peace of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not complete and should not be considered a AAA title.  It's been over a year since launch and most PC users are still having one or more huge issues with the game. With no official fixes and unofficial solutions not working for most, the game is for me and many others not completable.  With the few hours I was able to play [as now it crashes at the same point every time]I see there has been no real change from the early days of COD. Still feels clumsy with useless friendly AI, impossibly accurate enemy AI and is still extremely strict on where you can/can't go. With game titles from less well funded developers giving us increasingly more in game freedom and well balanced AI this title feels left behind.  Even though I got it on a huge sale for a COD game [Â£9.99] I feel ripped off, I can't complete the game, the developers don't care once they have your coin and the game has not been developed since the first Modern Warfare.  3/10 I have played far better alpha games than this.  ========= EDIT BEYOND THIS LINE=========  OK so after a few months I attempted to play the game again to see if anything was different. Other that a few minor OS security updates, and a GPU update getting ready for GTA V [NO GHOSTS UPDATE] it finally allows me to go beyond the glitched corner. Although after a while I am forced to restart the game as all light sources cover vast expanses of the screen and make it unplayable. Get rid of one problem and get a new one.  But my stance on this game is still unchanged. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the story is hopeless, AI still painful, and the restrictive game play even extends into the space battle where they managed to make a corridor out of the debris...endless space and I'm trapped in a 10m area.  DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have a high-end PC and i can barely run this game on medium settings. Preformance is a joke. Otherwise it's just another call of duty game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Laggy very badly optimised P.O.S not worth getting by a long shot. Even if it worked there are like 2k people that play it so you get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lobbies.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Please avoid this game. Infinity ward is a shell of its former self. This game is the same as mw2 and mw3. It was a waste of money and I am very dissapointed. Please get Black Ops 2 or Battlefield 4 instead and save your $$$. The Call of Duty franchise has been completely ruined and I shall not buy any more of the upcoming Call of Duty's much like the others whom bought this crap. Go read some reviews on this game and you'll see why. At most this deserves a 2/10 (In my opinion).
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game since MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is absolutly broken for PC, the lag and the frame cap just everything about it was not optimized for anything.lf you are to get this game for anything get it for console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of duty black ops II better!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy until the VAC system is added, you'll just run into hackers in every lobby."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Anytime i join a game online it picks the worst possible host and everyone lags
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This saga is getting worse each game they release. Activision, you fail as a company, you fail as business people and you fail at developing experiences to your users."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IS THIS THE BEST â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME EVER??  THE GAME IS LAGGIN' OMG CAN'T TELL HOW? MOUSES AIN'T SOFT AT ALL. REALLY DESAPOINTED
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There are moments when you can tell that its ripping off of previous COD games. While Modern Warfare series was grounded in Cold War and War on Terror tensions, Ghost takes place in a make believe reality where 1) space is weaponized (we have really important treaties to prevent this) and 2) Venezuela unifies Latin America and starts a space program (Brazil would not be so easily subdued). So basically repetative gameplay with a mediocre plot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is really bad they took no time to listen to pc player its always a port over and they dont understand that pc platform is not the same as console . Lag hackers with no way to stop them , if we have a real player owned dedicated server things would Be a lot better . This game is a no buy and i will not get the next one till i see things change."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Flappy Bird is better! 0/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Giving me money for playing this game would be too much!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its sucks dont buy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is really bad they took no time to listen to pc player its always a port over and they dont understand that pc platform is not the same as console . Lag hackers with no way to stop them , if we have a real player owned dedicated server things would Be a lot better . This game is a no buy and i will not get the next one till i see things change."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Once again, shafted by the greedy Call of Duty Series by Activision  Activision are showing no effort whatsoever to update their game to remove the stupid FOV lock or for their game to work on any form Ultra-Wide Screen Resolutions and are incompetent in sorting out in game hackers  Another Completely fail Call of Duty game, thanks for nothing Activision, don't bother with another one    I would NOT recommend this game to ANYONE, even if it was on a sale for 10 cents, i wouldn't bother spending money on this   Thanks for nothing Activision"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know what happened. I played the game at gaming-expo and it worked flawlessly, but after I bought it here, what did I get? A buggy mess that is horrible optimised. If you want to buy Call of Duty game for a multiplayer, get Black Ops 2. If you want to get Ghosts for a dog, well, it appears in ~2.5 missions, and you play as it only once, and this moment was in the preview on youtube."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I pre-ordered this game a few months before from the amazing black ops 2 , but by far this is the worst game upto date from other call of duty games .   The Multiplayer is completely unbalanced   - All weapons classes are way to overpowered  - 5 second Misleading killcams - System Requirments is ridiculous and is still unoptimized up to now - No Anti hack protections against hackers in multiplayer   -Severs is always empty with little people playing  - Horrible map designs  - 6 vs 6 on battlefield sized maps slow gameplay - Squard war is broken - Plain and predictable story line with better fish AI - Overpirced with no promised dedicated severs. - Low resolution textures and graphics - Depressing colour to the background. - The soundtrack and gun sounds is horrific - Killstreaks are hard ti earn and the specialist is completely broken - Spawn system is random - Do not purchase any overpriced DLCs  - Extinction is dull when playing solo - Poor pre-order bonus freefall  - Private map bots are overpowered  Do not purchase this game unless you seen the actual gameplay and felt like experiencing extinction with its predictable story . The multiplayer is deserted with no one playing so dont expect much from this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Despit the COD Review saying i have only played for 5 minutes i have played for over 6 hours. Becuase the Executables are Single Player and Multiplayer then they show different times.  The good point is the Extintion game mode is fun. Thats about all i can say that is good about the game.  Game looks terrible, i have optimised video and no joy. Tried custom settings and still no improvement. The textures are awfull. The Framerate is unstable, Items like the red dot site on the gun dissapear and reappear.  When your doing well its annoying to be kicked out of Exinction modes when your a good bit through and cannot get back in. Even the Manu at the start and the opening cinematic lags and jitters the audio sometime bunny hops in and out. The ammount of Ctrl Alt Delete's i have had to perform for crashes is far too much for my liking.  This will be the last COD game i buy.   I do not reccomend this game for the PC. If you do have a console however i think the experience may be much more of an improvement there in regards to stabbility,   Hope this helps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer only review &lt;rant&gt;This game.... I should be using the 'I'm not even mad, that's amazing' meme here, but the problem is i'm both really frustrated and amazed. What is amazing is also what's frustrating, and it is how a team as large as Infinity Ward, with as much money as Activision gives them, can produce a game that just plainly sucks so bad. I mean, its incredible, really. When a game is unplayable at launch, unplayable a week after launch, and just barely playable (but still not fun) almost a half year after launch, you are doing something wrong. People saying it doesn't feel like Call of Duty are right, because CoD is a game. This doesn't feel like a game, it feels like an infinite rage generator. &lt;/rant&gt;  Graphics: -Nothing special, especially considering its optimized so poorly that you would need a titan just to run it at medium settings. -It literally runs worse than crysis, but without coming near the same graphics level.   Gameplay: -Such lag, much delay, so teleport -That is all -Well, no, that is not all: -You die too fast, why does every gun have the damage of a Barret the recoil of the MW3 ACR? -IED, its like a claymore fused with a bouncing betty, then given steroids, and its anoying for everyone.  -UAV, you broke it, nuff said -Don't ever make people rely on a mobile app to do stuff you otherwise can't do in-game. The whole clan wars thing is kinda cool, but to everyone who doesn't have one of the few phones your app supports, it's rubbish. Also, the app is just as poorly optimized as the game, it runs like crap, lags a lot, and bugs all over the place.  -KEM in a care package? Who decided that was a good idea? My guess is some 12 year old kid who doesn't know how to play and just wants some easy kills... -The new prestieging system is a nice try, but a miss in my opinion. I like the Black Ops 2 system a lot more.  -Squad points, you just get them here and there, there is no acomplishment in unlocking anything.  -You added the 3-way split killstreak system back:D But you broke specialist, since the last killstreak is no longer all of them -Talking about specialist, why are there so many perks? More =/= better  Sound: -Finally something slightly positive, kinda, maybe, not really -The sound whoring (positional sound, for those who don't know) works, really well, but that doesn't matter because the game is already lagging so much it doesn't matter if you know someone is behind a corner. Its kinda like having nice wheels on a car, but the car is missing its engine.  -The guns all sound like nailguns....  DLC: -Really? -Wow -That is just asking for it. Why the heck would anyone want to throw away more money at a game that is already broken. Wolf skin, Cpt. Price skin, and so on, maybe you should have focused on fixing the game insteaf of making an extra 10 bucks off the 5 people acually buying it.  -Can't speak for the map pack DLC's as i have not wasted my precious money on them, but they are most likely alright. What bugs me about the DLC's is how they focused on DLC instead of fixing the broken game. (you don't spend your money adding a new TV to your house, if the roof is missing do you?)  Enjoyment: -None to be found -Like, at all -Even getting a kill or a killstreak just feels random and unrewarding  All in all: 1/10 I mean, at least the game starts up, that all it gets a point for, being able to start.   PS. Except for launch week, Black Ops 2 has generally had more players online."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is poop don't buy it lol
Call of Duty: Ghosts,garbage dont waste your money on this game if you want to play with hackers then play this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No. No... Just no.  I liked the campaign better than mutliplayer, but I dont just buy First Person Shooters for a campaign.  The story is written decently, but the levels and characters make it look like a low budget Sci-Fi movie. The only 'good' part was the Dog, but he only appeared in a few missions.  The mulitplayer is the just horrid. Bad Maps, Bad Guns, I dont even get why there is 30+ perks, and the Character Customization. I'm just waiting for the MMO of Call of Duty, cause this game is turning out like a very bad MMO. If you want this game, I suggest Tetris first. Why? Tetris is better"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay while it worked. The game crashes in the same place (towards the end of the factory mission - mission 13). Verified integrity twice. Getting Direct3DDevice::Present failed (DEVICE REMOVED). After it asked me to run it in safe mode and I did it, it now fails to start altogether. If you google it, many people have had the same problem and there is no clear and user-friendly solution. Do not buy this game until they fix it. I am running it on i-5 2500k, gtx 770, windows 8.1 pro  EDIT: updating nvidia drivers to 347.09 resolved the issue. However, the stuttering of sound at the end of loading screen cutscenes has yet to be fixed.  So why still a negative review? This game cost many gamers and myself a lot of time trying to overcome its bugs. It should have worked straight out of the box or pretty close to it at the price they were asking for it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Jesus christ this game is horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a disgrace to PC gaming, I will never buy another cod again. I run a high end gaming rig and achieve 20-40 fps with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing frame stutters on low settings, yet I run Battlefield 4 at 75+ FPS on ultra.    69/420 Would Waste $60 again  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There are a lot of bad things to say about this.  First at all this game is terrible optimized I can play this with 60 fps but sometimes drops random to 20 while I can run bf4 on ultra without drops.  Second, the weapon balance in multiplayer is terrible most weapons kill way to quick and some way to slow.  Third, the map design is terrible I would like to see map types from modern warfare 2 back and cod 4.  Fourth, It has alot of graphics issue's.  Fifth, One cutscene is just copied from the ending of modern warfare 2   sixth, Unbalanced kill streaks like the guard dog it is doing way to much for it's amount of kills I think this should be like 7 kills at least.  Seventh, They promised dynamic map events but there isn't a whole lot dynamic events to the map like a falling gas station except when someone gets a K.E.M strike.  Eight, you can get a K.E.M (nuke) out of a care package  Nineth, squad points  tenth, the perk system in previous cods you could only have 3 perks (except in black ops 2 you can have 6 at max there) while you can get around 8 perks here.  The only real positive what I have to say about this game is the campaign is quite good.  And I know I can't create a game myself but cod's are getting worse every year and I hoped ghosts was actualy good but they realy screwed this one up, if you want a good military shooter than you should stick with battlefield 3 and 4 counter strike is also good aswell.  So this is (proably) the last cod I'm ever gonna buy.  As a verdict I give this one a 3 out of 10   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The story is for the most part boring. Nothing really exciting happens exept for the space and underwater missions. The multiplayer is a joke. The game is horribly optimized and a pc port disaster. Even if they fix this game on pc its already too late. If you were looking for fun multiplayer then don't bother with this game. The entire multiplayer traffic goes into two game modes while the other game modes are left empty. If you have a low end pc this game won't even run. You need to have at least 6 gigs of ram and its an 8 gig install. Idk where all that memory goes but it certainly wasn't in the graphics or gameplay. What a ripoff.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't get this game seriously. Its just the same old MW2.5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Played a bit of SP and thats turning out decently so far and thats being generous. MP is just a nightmare, I don't think I ever bothered to stop playing this game as soon as i launched it. Extremely poor pc optimization and absurd requirements due to the laziness of the port. Its full of bugs and lag. After release, there was a patch made and even then nothing has changed. This is like Guitar Hero all over again. Just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ after â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Just go back to MW3/MW2/Blops1/2. Infinity Ward is a joke of a company now. All the original founding members that made CoD great has left and went onto better things. So, please don't buy this game. It's just not worth your money and time. You could have a grand meal instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another game with no effort put in to it. Lag, stutter and unoriginal."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game left a perminate â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ stain on my account in the forum of a vac ban all because of a 90 fov slider. in 100% honesty if you still buy or play this game you need help
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't even have any words to describe this game. It's intense,the gameplay is smooth and awesome,the leaning is useful,the weapon recoil is just perfect. This is by far the best CoD ever released.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Looks bad, plays even worse... Please stay away!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I very much regret that i own this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the worst CoD ever made and one of the worst game ever! the multiplayer is a joke, terrible netcode, random respawns, hacked lobbies filled with cheaters, multiplayer already dead after less than a month, laggy, awful optimization... and i can keep going... this crap is a scam, it doesnt feel like a CoD game at all, it feels more like a cheap free to play game. Save your money! avoid this POS of a game at all costs! If you like CoD, stick to mw1, mw2, or blops2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My perspective of the game COD: Ghosts is bad Its a negative review so for the fanboys, please don't read my review &amp; opinion.   Storymode/Campaign Now even though there are a few flaws that where already being discussed about on the internet. For example 'The moving fish thing' and the same animations as in MW series, I still liked the singleplayer and its story. Of course we already been through the whole repel-down thing, but there are scenes that will still blow your mind. Thats all i can possible say without spoiling to much.  The multiplayer isn't a game from this time, i think they should have put more effort into as it now seems they didn't. there isn't really one bit that stunned me playing the MP. The whole class thing seems to look familiar to BO2, which you either like or don't. It also seems to be focused on crew/squads which is kinda a kick to the nuts for the lonewolfs. I might still give it some more time but it ain't no love on first sight thats for sure.  '4 friends want this game:' Don't!! please just don't. nah its your own choice, just don't say i didn't warn you. '2 friends already own this game:' my advice to them, get a six shooter and put it under your chin.   My lawyer suggest i leave this message so here we go, Spoon and friends DO NOT advice anyone to hurt themselfs in anyway. If you magically somehow didn't experience the game same as written above, keep in mind that this review is based on personal opinions of certain individuals.  Enjoy the game.. or not. Peace, Spoon"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It was bound to happen at some point. MW3 was a sign of things to come - Cheers to Treyarch for making Black Ops II and releasing it out officially on a higher level than 'BETA' status. GHOSTS will be a fully developed title at some point - MAYBE for PC. When that time comes I am sure there will be some good games to be had.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you liked BLOPS2 then you probably will not like this game. If you like camping/sniping then it may be your kind of game.  If you like to run and gun just say NO and save your money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of time and cash.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of time and money hackers gallore and no dedicated servers for PC players dam console port
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible game. Buy it at your own risk.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is broken single player ai gets stuck then everyone ends up just looking up at the sky or having a yelling match with the other ai not shooting and when you leave your team behind you die, wtf COD not gg"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I very much regret that i own this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, servers wont work properly and cant even connect to a single game. Only thing worth something is extinction mode.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The PC version of CoD: Ghosts is nothing but a joke, horribly unoptimized mess.  - Low Quality Textures on the Extra Image Quality setting. - Frame Rate Drops. - Stutters/Judders a lot. - Occasional Crashing - Audio Crackles and Pops when playing in Full Screen. - Frame Rate also cannot go above 91 without an FPS Unlocker from what I've heard. - Iron/Reflex Sights can get messed up like the Iron Sights getting stretched abnormally or the Red Dot Sights getting obstructed by weird grey triangle textures.  I've had to turn off many Graphics settings in-game, mess around with NVIDIA Control Panel, force the game to run at Normal Priority in Task Manager, run the game in Windowed Borderless and get a fan fix for the low res textures to make the game at least decently playable.  If your gonna get this latest installment of the Call of Duty series, I suggest getting it on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 because you know why? Because it runs the best of every platform this game is on... yes even over the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Ghosts because they have frame rate issues as well (Plus the Wii U version which has no DLC support aside from getting Free Fall in an update)"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has a very poor PC optimization. Consistent lags, no FOV changer, poor support for the aspect ratio of 21:9. Sometimes the game lags more, sometimes less. Sometimes it's even unplayable. The game also has very bad maps. Some maps are too big, some - too small. Free Fall bonus map is a joke. You die too randomly there. I also think that developers didn't pay much attention to the killstreaks. The only killstreak I like is the K.E.M. Strike. It just feels like they put a ton of effort into it and forgot about other killstreaks. But besides these problems, Call of Duty: Ghosts has very nice weapons, which feel so much better than in Black Ops 2. Also, the game has a wide selection of perks. The gameplay isn't much changed but feels better than Blak Ops 2 and MW3. At the moment it doesn't seem unbalanced. Even though this game has a ton of issues, I think it made it's way to my TOP 3 COD games list. Just because I like it's gameplay much more than other Call of Duty games. Unless you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan, I wouldn't recommend this game. It just has too much issues that need to be fixed. At the end of the day, I give it a raiting of 6/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terrible port, poor map design, and not even enough players to play anything but TDM  Need I say more?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,looks like a ps2 game and the gameplay is like rambo the videogame only that you can move
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game will kill Call of Duty better than Battlefield ever will.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This ruined everything of Call Of Duty. I think this game should be taken off of steam because its such a shame. The worst part is, the fact that its stealing ideas from Halo and plus they rushed the game. Black Ops and Black Ops 2 was probably the last 2 good cod games. This should not exist, because it disgusts me and fills me with shame for buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth the time or the money.  - Terrible Port - Seems to care more about Dog Fur Physics and DLC than fixing the Field of View - Fake Infinity Ward (The Infinity Ward we know and love are working on Titanfall)  Can I get my money back on this? 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I went into this game with high expectations, but I was very disappointed with this game. First of all, I had to upgrade my PC to get past that stupid error in the beginning because I didn't have 6GB of RAM. But I thought: Well, since the game has such high specs, it must be worth it. Furthermore, the game itself was a bit more than 40 GB. And to be honest, I think that most of that space just went to Fish AI and Dog AI. The Singleplayer Campaign was alright, and the ending was pretty good, although unrealistic (Welcome to CoD). The loading screens with the cutscenes were really laggy, and the audio kept on buffering, too. There were huge gaps in between missions (You just jumped from random place to random place), and most of the time you still really didn't know what was going on. The characters weren't intruiging whatsoever, and the only character you remember after you finish the campaign is Riley, the dog (Oh, the irony). The only thing I feel that's good about the campaign is the voice acting, which is quite well done. (I guess it's good 'cause Infinity Ward didn't get a chance to mess with it.) The Multiplayer is, in one word, horrendous. It's like Infinity Ward didn't even bother, nor test their Multiplayer, that's how bad it is. They feel like they can get away with making the same game over and over again, but this time that's not the case. The time to kill is way too fast, the game is infested with campers thanks to this. Soundwhoring is WAY too easy, which also leads to more camping. The dog is too overpowered, it has more health than a player and it just one-shot kills you, while you can't do anything about it. THE MAPS ARE WAY TOO BIG! After 5 minutes some matches still have about 30 kills per team. The teammaking is worste than ever. Also, the spawns are absolutely horrible, you just spawn in front or behind enemies. And the worst part is, Infinity Ward really doesn't seem like they want to fix any of their issues. Instead, they just opt to dish out more DLC. The DLC is, by the way, quite creative, but the fact that you have to buy the DLC to make this game 'fun' (to some extent) is a majour downfall.  The game is also very poorly optimised for PC and there are barely any options. Also, the graphics are horrendous, too. I swear the graphics in Black Ops 2, and even Black Ops 1, were better. The colour scheme is bad too. I wish there was an option so you could change it, cause it's really hard to differentiate different objects. And the final nail in the coffin is the fact that pretty much no-one plays it on PC. There are about 2K people online, and the maximum amount of players nowadays is about 3K. So it takes forever to find a game.  So, overall, I really wouldn't reccomend this game. Since most people will buy this game for the Multiplayer, I seriously suggest that you don't even bother with this game. This game is definitely the worst in the Franchise. With Advanced Warfare around the corner, I hope that they can deliver a better game. If you want this game, I just suggest sticking to Black Ops 2 for now (It's better in pretty much every aspect, and it has more players online). Oh and by the way, Extinction is a worse version of Zombies and it only has one map (unless you buy the DLC, obviously).  My rating for this game would be a 3.5/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The 1939 Invasion of Poland was more balanced than this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terrible port, poor map design, and not even enough players to play anything but TDM  Need I say more?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,looks like a ps2 game and the gameplay is like rambo the videogame only that you can move
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game will kill Call of Duty better than Battlefield ever will.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is too horrible. I can't even finish the campaign. The story is horrendous. I was a fan of the Modern Warfare trilogy but this game's campaign is pathetic.  Astronauts with guns? Laughable exposition? Zombies ripoff? Absurd and cliche bad guys?   All and more!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This ruined everything of Call Of Duty. I think this game should be taken off of steam because its such a shame. The worst part is, the fact that its stealing ideas from Halo and plus they rushed the game. Black Ops and Black Ops 2 was probably the last 2 good cod games. This should not exist, because it disgusts me and fills me with shame for buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am able to play this game on one computer but on the one I use more often for gaming it is incompable for my graphics card, and no help has been provided by either the graphics card producer or Infinity Ward."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"poorly ported game, initially not even playable. not even patched for bugs &amp; fixes. Treyarch did it right in blackops 2 and infinity ward screwed evrerything on this game...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth the time or the money.  - Terrible Port - Seems to care more about Dog Fur Physics and DLC than fixing the Field of View - Fake Infinity Ward (The Infinity Ward we know and love are working on Titanfall)  Can I get my money back on this? 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Imagine that they used the dog as a selling point for this episode of this neverending franchise. From that point the game goes even more down. The so called 'story' is so hollow and pointless that when you are in the middle of the campaign (2 and a half hours aprox) you forgot why the hell you are doing what you're doing.  Avoid as a disease this horrible PC port. Doesn't run smooth even if you have a computer that can run Crysis 3 with all settings to max.   Hey, but they added an option to increase the dog's hair realism."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Extinction is amazing. The storyline is predictable, the characters lack personality. Not next gen graphics at all, yes it does in fact run on the same graphics engine as MW3, it is just an updated version of it, but the clearly dated engine just makes most of this game look like crap compared to other 'next gen' titles. Multiplayer is plagued by really bad spawns, guns that all feel the same, poor map design and inconsistent audio. I could on for a very long time about the different things that just make this game lowzy, but the morale of the story is.   3/10 Would not buy again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unplayable and overpriced. Nothing innovative as it has been promised by Activision. No dedicated servers. No ping indication. Laggy, slow and glitchy. Broken SLI support. How is it possible that I can play ARMA 3, BF4, COD MW3 and Black Ops 2 on medium and high settings and Ghosts on minimum? Singleplayer is way worse then previous COD's (I could barely forced myself to finish it ).  Update. After 2 months: SLI fixed with Beta nVidia drivers. Multiplayer is unplayable since IW somehow managed to release a game without anti-cheat implementation. Oh goody :) Seriously how is it possible that people who were reported two months ago are still playing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's pretty fun, but most games turn into camper city, tons of server lag (bo2, cs:go and bf 3/4 all run with a max ming of 40ms on my connection) And it seems to not be optimised for any pc. after like 3 updates, it's playable gpu wize, but the terrible connections make it unbearable. you get shot once, and the kill cam shows 5, it's clear most of the time is spent working on the console version, BO2 works great on pc. and all the PC only features such as FOV were removed for ghosts.  on the days when I get a good servers, where the entire other team is not camping, the game is pretty fun, but even with all the updates, and running it on my i7+7970 with 16gb of ram, it still dose not run as smooth as bo2.  from what I've read mw3 has similar issues, WILL NOT be buying annother IW cod game for PC!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Biggest mistake I've made on Steam. That's the last time I pre-order a game.  Put about 16 hours into the Multiplayer, but I ended up uninstalling it in disgust. Couldn't make it run smoothly on any settings (even though all my other games run smoothly). No FOV slider. But worst of all, it's just not fun. I prefer objective game modes, but there's no Demolition mode and the Domination mode spawns you randomly all over the map making team tactics difficult if not impossible. Time after time I've spawned right into enemy fire. large maps with small 6v6 teams, with many of the players just camping a dark corner somewhere. Frequently see hackers ruining what little entertainment value there was.   Waste of money and time - back to Black Ops 2, which has its flaws but at least it's fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible game, can't even play, ram is way to high (even higher then arkham). Would rather buy an album of T.S songs then this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player campaign was great fun and The Extinction mode is good, BUT THE MULTIPLAYER IS REALLY BAD: so much lag, hackers, silly maps THAT SUCKS! I don't feel like playing call of duty anymore."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nub game rofl
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've played every Call Of Duty since COD2 and Ghosts is the worst PC multiplayer title to date. No high hopes left for the franchise.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy/Buggy/Hackers... Treyarch obviously gives more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about PC than Infinity Ward*;/ The sniping is fun tho, however regular guns are a little bit OP."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont bother, waste of money, Cant even play the last game on my copy. called the support to be told it was my system, even though I can play skyrim for 12hrs straight without a mention of errors.  Always supported COD since Big red, till now this is the Last game I will ever buy from the COD franchise...  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The original assumption I had before buying this game was that it would be just another CoD replica of the old formula for 2013 with Doge edition. Since I never owned or played any CoD games in the past, I've decided to give this one a try.  It was worse then I thought it would be.  It definitely earned the notorious title for being the worst CoD game ever played. It's quite a record to break out of the norm. Hahhahahahha!  It's not properly optimized for PC. At all. It's mindboggling that even if its configured correctly with my MSI GX60 gaming laptop with a AMD Radeon graphics card (HDD of 750 gb / 7200 RPM), I assumed that it would run the damn game with minor flaws. But no, constant experience of heavy lag and frequent crashes are still occured. The FPS is out of control, the graphics are trimmed to mediocre even in the highest setting. So despite fixing it with different anti-alising settings and playing it in low quality, it's not smooth and fun to play. As a matter of fact, you couldn't even play it, period.   I think this game was designed intentionally in favor of the consoles so the 'next gen' archaic requirements such as the Xbox One would generate some more profits. Just as shown in one of Microsoft's Full Press Conference of the Xbox One video, this could be the explination why the PC servers were â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because Infinity Ward put no effort with the PC version.   TV TV TEEVEE TV SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS CALL OF DUTY DOGE DOGE DOGE OF DUTY. The issues were obvious in the start, we just didn't believe it.  Better off with Black Ops II."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gameplay 6/10 The gunplay in this game is like any other Call of Duty game but feels dumbed down a bit compared to older titles. There isn't much to comment on other than guns fire bullets and those bullets kill quickly. The movement is no doubt the smoothest of any CoD game right now. The fast vaulting, the transitions from prone to couch to standing is really well done.  Graphics 5/10 The game has low resolution textures that aren't really interesting to the eye. The foliage is a definite improvement over the last game. The water is disgusting low resolution and static. The guns and character models on the other hand are much higher resolution. Effects such as bloom, depth of field and sunrays aren't anything new so that's the reason for the low score. Though props to Nvidia for including Physx fur tech which to me looks really amazing, but the amount of time you spend looking at dog fur is next to none. Physx turbulence adds dynamic effects to smoke and other decals much lags more than it does good.  Audio/Music 5/10 Throughout my whole playthrough of the story I can't recall any song or music within the soundtrack that caught my attention. The audio design for guns is minimal to me with most guns sounding the same just pitched differently. Explosions have a noticeable lower bass volume to them making them less epic and enjoyable.  Story 5/10 The story is functional. Nothing amazing. Plot twists are somewhat expected and is just another story of a few guys saving the world from destruction. Voice acting is rather okayish to bad, no noticeably good voice acting.  Setting 7/10 The story does take you around a few places. The forests are a nice change to the environment as well as the snow but external conflicts happen rarely as most gameplay is focused in tight in door corridors. The game although ugly as it may be, does the forest scene rather well by throwing around foliage and trees and other decals.  Overall 5.5/10 The smooth gameplay is what keeps the game above the 5 mark. This game has got to be the worst CoD game I've played in a while in terms of story and overall design. Compared to Black Ops 2 or even Modern Warfare 3, this game is truly a step backwards in all aspects of gameplay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single is ok but multi is a failure. Extinction is not bad. Dont buy it until price drops 10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Needs good security against cheaters/hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please do yourself a favor, don't buy the so called 'game'. First of all, runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the PC, I have a very high-end computer, and I can't run this at it's lowest settings.   Second of all, the amount of people on here makes it hard to find any game that isn't team-deathmatch. Half the game types are emtpy.   If by some miracle the game works for you and you find a lobby, I can almost guarantee somebody in that lobby is hacking... And if they aren't, the game is boring AF and the killstreaks aren't even worth getting because they do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-all.  The single-player story is supposed to be great, but the gameplay itself is way too easy, and short.  Overall it gets a -10/10 from me, boring gameplay, lack of support from the devs, and worst maps ever in a COD game... Please don't buy this game, you'll regret it within the hour."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥InG sucks a bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Jessus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing christ this game is terrible. the plot of the main story is so stupid and boring that i stopped following it about 30 minutes in. The ending was crap too. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iNg Terminator over here gets shot in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing heart twice, is in a train that gets flooded, and falls 2 stories high, and this mothaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥a gets back up and is completely un-injured. The story wasn't even the worst part of the game. The mutilplayer offers nothing new. 'Yay, a new running anamation' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i want new weapons, not retextures. No that's not even the worst part. I went 25 and 0 and got called a hacker and got reported by a god danmed ten year old who sounds like his balls haven't dropped yet, for being good at this sad excuse for a video game. they need to really think over their ideas, because this games was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. P.S. Thi game is the perfect gift for that little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in your life that you want yelling through your household. Rated M for 5 and up"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is when Infinity Ward knew they messed up. Game was okay, never did touch online multiplayer except for the alien mode and campagin. Other then that i believe i did waste my money. I should had listened to the community  Pros + Alien mode + FANTASTIC weapons + Dynamic Multiplayer maps + Cool gamemodes in Multiplayer + Controller support + Squads mode (Practice with bots) + Cool Personalization packs + Much better anti-cheat system  Cons - Multiplayer has only 'GHOSTS' and 'FEDERATION' teams - Too many DLC - Campagin has a bug to where you must lower graphics, if not you will be playing on a white screen - No internet connection bars or ping system in the Multiplayer scoreboard - Weapon textures sometimes gets screwed up  - Bugs to where AI doesnt progress"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,3 Words: Don't Get It
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is horrible!More than a month after it's release and it still isn't optimised enough.I have only played it for 10 hours because of the fps drops,bugs etc. Inf.Ward must take a look at the PC version not focus all their efforts to fix the console 'issues'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thankfully, I didn't buy this game, it was gifted to me. I have been sitting here playing this 'game' for the past couple of hours and I believe I'm close to the end. I don't even know if I'm going to finish the singleplayer at all. I lost interest in this game when I first launched it, but I'm not going to be 'that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' to the person who bought me this 'game'....On second thought I'm gonna call it 'Advanced shooting range 2013'. So anyway, I'm trying to get through it without losing so many braincells in the process and as I'm playing this 'Next-gen shooter' I'm messaging my friend about how stupid the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'm experiencing and I didn't want to be alone when I played this so i didn't Contemplate suicide. IGN gave this game an 8.8 (great). Hey IGN, get your egotistical heads out of Activisions â™¥â™¥â™¥ and write a REAL review. Let me help you IGN. The game is repetitive, gameplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, voice acting is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing god awful and WHY IN THE ACTUAL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DID THEY MAKE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DOG A BIG â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DEAL?!?!? YOU SEE THE LITTLE FURBALL LIKE 3 TIMES! Also The part when you go into space WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! When That shuttle opened and I'm in a shoot out I said to myself I'm done I'm â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING done. I'm gonna stop before I have a heart attack. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU ACTIVISION AND IW!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,+ Single Player Campaign + Audio/Video + There are no OverPowered weapons + Great Create-a-Class system + Multiplayer is fun...  - ... but only for a few days - Worst challenges in MP to date - Worst 'Pointstreaks' in MP to date - Worst maps in MP to date - Extinction is short and without replayability - It costs 59.99 euro (without microtransactions)  7/10 (SP) 6/10 (MP) 2/10 (ex.)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"NEVER  i say, Dont buy IT.  This game is NOT anticheat protected.  97% of TD-MATCH is hacked lobby.  I go play MW3!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,biggest pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ known to man
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont get the game graphies card too high
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty to date. Multiplayer is smaller than previous games. PC performance is horrible while graphics are no change from previous titles.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts looked like a good game. And was hyped up. The truth of the matter is, it's a bad game.  Let's start out with singleplayer.  Singleplayer story doesn't really make sense, ending is stupid, and there are some bad glitches.  Multiplayer, oh boy.  This has to be the worst multiplayer I've ever seen since MW3. Yeah duel render snipers, ooo, ahhh. But it's not any better. Weapons are still overpowered, and worst of all, it's terrible, and I mean TERRIBLY optimized for the PC.  I hope you took this review seriously and remember it. Save your $60 for something else.   Rating: -10000000000000000000000000000000/5  Thank you for your time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will never touch this game again, it is awful -1,000,000-OUTTA-10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Still complete garbage with the Ram Limitation. I have 8gb 1866 Ram. I can't even finish the first mission of campaign without it crashing 3 times -_-
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Some reasons to buy this Call of duty, and some reasons not to:  Dont buy it because:  1. If you are looking for hackers, you dont have to look too far, they are in your team and the enemy's team 2. It's not so different from previous CoDs 3. Crashes, FPS drops, bugs and laggs arent rare at all... 4.The System Requirements are insane and indefensible 5.There are not enough people in the un-popular modes, so you will have to play TeamDeathMatch or Domination most of the time. Actually, there are more players that playing at the previous CoD: Black Ops 2. 6.The game intended to Xbox and PlayStation. they sall it for the PC gamers only for the money.  Buy it because: 1.When you get your chopper, you are happy. The gamestyle is good. 2. If you havent played CoD before, buy it now! You are missing the best FPS experience at all times! 3.This game goes good with friends: You play, you laugh, you enjoy. You wont be alone anymore! =P 4.At the moment, when in BattleField you go through objects, and Titanfall steals ideas from CoD, its the best FPS game that you can find. 5. You wont finish this game so easily: The way to Max prestige is very long, and there you dont get the feeling that you are repeating yourself. 6. The Extinction mode is unique, you wont find it anywhere else. If you like this mode i advice to buy the Season Pass.  If you like this game, and if you arent, i want you know that although this CoD is controversial, the previous CoDs were awesome, so Do not disqualified the next CoD! He may be much better, as any other CoD. Just dont kill the great FPS game series Call of Duty, only because one of them!   Thank you for reading, slep a like on the LIKE buttom if you liked this review! Feel free to comment! =D"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,only played it for extinction.         no one plays extinction.           should've got it for the xbox.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. don't waste your money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The best character was the dog.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been playing for 37 mins now, it froze 6 times already!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Oh god why did waste money on this. same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as MW2 and MW3, i'll bet that they are now making a CoD:Ghosts series, and you know what, it's gonna suck too and be overpriced. I still see low-res textures, i see Free2Play games with better texture work than this and you need a high-end pc for this. To me it it looks like Ghosts could run like MW2, MW3 so what the hell did they do that requires so many resources from a pc. Rip off, just like black ops 1 and 2. MW2 i can accept but 3 no. You haven't improved anything only replaced â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that was there with new.  NEVER AGAIN!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is one of the worst optimized games I have ever played. To give you an idea of how poorly optomized this game is I can run Battlfield 4 at ultra settings with an average framerate of 30 and I can't play this on a mix of normal/high settings without hitching/stuttering, it should be noted that this problem is largely resticted to the multiplayer and not the single player from what I've seen. It seems like the only way to fix this (in part) is by disabling distortion, motion blur, DOF, terrain detail and shadows (the last one doesn't actually disable them it just makes it less dynamic). I'm not sure if there will ever be a fix for these major graphic problems but until they do this game will have a very small online community.   Even on sale I would strongly suggest that you DO NOT buy this game on pc. While the game itself is fun and the pc controls are good it is still one of the weaker games in the series. If you have your heart set on getting COD Ghosts I would suggest you buy it on console instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not even worth 20â‚¬. This is why:   -It has rlylry bad performance even with good machines and for the performance it takes the graphics are not much better then COD-MW2.  -The game has various fps, lag issues. Some caused by Hosts but the most are due to unknown reasons. Just take a look in the community hub and type the keyword 'lag' and u will find like 1.500 entries with no solution.  - It feels like every patch they release just makes it worse. After the last patches it got just unplayable for me. (ingame lags and lags in main menu.... ye in the menu... srsly not kidding)  - Sometimes the game is just crashing when u start it. For me its like 90% of the time when i start it first time. I have to kill it in task-manager and restart to get it working.  - It feels like the game gets pay to win. Everytime they release a new DLC it comes with overpowered weapon(s). For those who play cod-ghosts: the ripper for example feels like a .50 cal smg that ripps apart just everything.  - Hackers! &gt;.&lt;  All in all this is not more than a beta version of the game.  And im not saying that to just show my anger or smth like that. I played a couple of betas and i playd alot of cod titles and this one rly feels like a early access game.   *Edit: 130h played in Multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do Not Buy This Game! This is the poorest release in the Call of Duty series. For being a multi-billion dollar company Activision/ Infinity Ward's standards do not even measure up to many of the Indie game publisher today. From poorly optimize code to bad game mechanics Call of Duty Ghosts is a big step backwards from Modern Warfare 3. This will be the last Call of Duty I purchase developed by Infinity Ward as they are not the old Infinity Ward we once knew. The new Infinity Ward is only concerned about rushing out unfinished software while taking your hard-earned money. If you like Call of Duty stick with the older games or wait till Treyarch releases their new game later this year. If you buy this game, I am warning you, you will be disappointed and out of $60 so do not do it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't say this game is awful or gross! No! This game is good FPS, and it's really interesting to play, if only you have played not too many games like CoD.  I definitely wouldn't recommend you to buy it if you played at least Call Of Duty:Modern Warfare 2(which is a great game actually) beacuse it is nothing new(exept story, and REALLY HIGH system requirements) in Ghosts in comparison to older versions of Call Of Duty(not speaking about Call Of Duty 1 and Call Of Duty 2 of course)! P.S. And Ghosts costs a lot more money than other CoDs :'c"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"HACKERS, MORE HACKERS, OHHH! AND MORE HACKERS!!! Exactly like in MW2 &amp; MW3 or even worst!!!   -Tons of hackers that makes this game unplayable. -The lobby takes forever to find a match. -The clan vs clan thing is trash, (Donâ€™t even work correctly, and you need to add and external APP so you can manage your clan, REALLY?.) -Lag on the menu reallly?... and lag on the game.   This company donâ€™t care about PC.ï»¿  (Black ops 2 was a good game, no hackers or the ones that hack get ban super fast).  Score: 7"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To be honest I'm doing this for the pillar of community badge.....DON'T GET CALL OF DUTY...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.......................................................................................................
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Once upon a time, there were a new competitor to the Medal of Honor series. Call of Duty came with its great gameplay, cinematic feel and feet-on-the-ground action.  Over time they developed their Call of Duty franchise into the golden nugget that was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  This was, and is the Call of Duty highlight, because after that, they became repetative, unsatifactory in graphics, and felt like they lost their focus on the feet-on-the-ground basic action.  And today we have Call of Duty Ghosts; a post-apocalyptic game, with the same graphics as always, and gimmicks as for example the very animated attack dog.  This game just dont captivate you. Neither in the graphics, story or gameplay. I found it actually kinda boring. Like something i already seen so many times.  I really wish Infinity Ward a great success, but this game is a waste of time and i cannot recommend it to anyone.  Better just to buy the old Modern Warfare 2....   Maybe next title is better....who knows.....this was a wash up anyway.....   Over and out!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game sucks, get treyarch games they know what to do! Instinction is a joke"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The same generic call of duty FPS. Good thing i got this for free, otherwise i would be very upset if i paid any money for this crapfest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"laggy as anything, but still a good play every so often"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wasted $60 on this game back in November 2013. Waste of money. I got excited when steam refunds were announced, but you apparently can only refund games that you bought 2 or less weeks ago. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Horrible voice acting, choppy movement, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ textures, too many hackers, the story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and the multiplayer is god awful. This game should have been marketed as a point and click game. However, I'll give this game the benefit of the doubt and say that despite my utter hatred for this trashâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ title, the portions of the game where you play as Riley were really fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer hardly ever has anyone online...roughly the most you will find is 2000 people. THe story mode is epically boring and quite fake...I mean...who invades in space and carries guns??? All in all...waste of money...plus the game is HUGE!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Possibly the biggest waste of money ever created, developer's give 0 care to customer's and practically gives you the finger if you buy this game. Full of hackers and the developer refuses to acknowledge it or do anything about it, they refuse to patch in something to eliminate hackers. Reporting on this game serves about as much use as sticking your big toe in a bowl of hot water while trying to keep warm in Antarctica."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a Game: Nice. Fast paced. On CoD Line. No vehicles, no complications, just run &amp; gun. Its Fun. As Technical: Overall bad performance on lot of setups. Strange game crashes. Weird bugs. As support: No support at all. Delayed Fixes. No hard anticheat policy (game is full of them). As product: They lie. No dedicated servers (they said yes). Only money scam (unicorn skin, clown skin,etc, maps,etc) but no fixes, no dedicated servers, no support, no anticheat.  End words: Game is fun but production / support is like a scam / joke."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The same generic call of duty FPS. Good thing i got this for free, otherwise i would be very upset if i paid any money for this crapfest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"laggy as anything, but still a good play every so often"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You're better off throwing $60 into a fire.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wasted $60 on this game back in November 2013. Waste of money. I got excited when steam refunds were announced, but you apparently can only refund games that you bought 2 or less weeks ago. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Horrible voice acting, choppy movement, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ textures, too many hackers, the story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and the multiplayer is god awful. This game should have been marketed as a point and click game. However, I'll give this game the benefit of the doubt and say that despite my utter hatred for this trashâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ title, the portions of the game where you play as Riley were really fun."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer hardly ever has anyone online...roughly the most you will find is 2000 people. THe story mode is epically boring and quite fake...I mean...who invades in space and carries guns??? All in all...waste of money...plus the game is HUGE!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Possibly the biggest waste of money ever created, developer's give 0 care to customer's and practically gives you the finger if you buy this game. Full of hackers and the developer refuses to acknowledge it or do anything about it, they refuse to patch in something to eliminate hackers. Reporting on this game serves about as much use as sticking your big toe in a bowl of hot water while trying to keep warm in Antarctica."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is like anal - you think it will be good, so willfully allow it to have its way with you, then as soon as it enters you, you feel like you have been butt â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed for the rest of your life. You talk to people and feel like you need to tell them, but are too embarrassed. Well here it is, I let this game into my life, and now I have to live with my past. I am mortified."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a Game: Nice. Fast paced. On CoD Line. No vehicles, no complications, just run &amp; gun. Its Fun. As Technical: Overall bad performance on lot of setups. Strange game crashes. Weird bugs. As support: No support at all. Delayed Fixes. No hard anticheat policy (game is full of them). As product: They lie. No dedicated servers (they said yes). Only money scam (unicorn skin, clown skin,etc, maps,etc) but no fixes, no dedicated servers, no support, no anticheat.  End words: Game is fun but production / support is like a scam / joke."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Was so eager for this game, but unfortunately it just wasn't good at all. On PC there are tons of hackers and it is also very poorly optimized. For basically having the same graphics as MW3, the game runs very slowly. Save your money and buy 20 double cheeseburgers at McDonalds. I'd rather be fat than bored."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There are too many hackers! and no point in reporting them for their cheating as no gives a toss (ACTIVISION)! Made a billion bucks on the first day of sales however keeping it real and surporting the fans,,, disapointing!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This actually made me consider suicide. No Joke
Call of Duty: Ghosts,20 hours n I finished the game... and the NUMEROUS segway / cut scenes / movies... added ABSOLUTELY nothing to the game or story line... pretty weak in my opinion.  Spend your money on something that lasts longer..... like an ice cube in the sun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy it ... Just tried mp mode. My first mp match already got a hacker on the other team.... The developers do not do anything about this They just don't care about this game after it is released  Let's talk about campaign mode. It has the same elements found in older cod games which makes it sightly better than Battlefield 4. The campaign mode still worth a try with the new levolution effects.  But overall.... Just dont buy this and dont support the lazy developers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Are you serious? This franchise panders to the dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥ kids out there who don't know what a FPS is. The graphics are crap even on MAX settings. It isn't worth the money and neither will be any that come after it because they build these games so fast they dont want to waste the man hours on actualy building a decent game. It cuts into their profits and you actually think they care about your satisfaction or their proffit margins? You make the decision.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A:'Hey! Hey! did u know Call of Duty Ghost!' B:'Hoo....i know' A:'Did u ever played it?' B:'Nope, tell me something about that game, is that about Ghost? Characters from Modern Warfare 2 who get killed by Sherperd and die together with Roach like a gay?' A:'Ehm, nope! it's about Ghost squad!' B:'Hoo...can we use Cloack?' A:'No' B:'...Flying?' A:'Hmm nope' B:'Then, why using 'ghost?' A:'Well don't know, i don't like that game anyway' B:'Why the hell you asks me then..' A:'I think, that game already dissapear like a 'Ghost' '  -Bad SP, Boring MP but -Good Extinction Mode and Squad Mode OwO b  6/10 - Overall Rating 4/9 - Call of Duty Ghost/Battlefield 4 5/7 - Call of Duty Ghost/Call of Duty Advanced Warfare  A:'Anyway, why you review it just now?' Me:'Up to me!' B:'I guess he is bored'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you value your money, do not purchase this at any cost.  Terrible PC port, poor performance, lack of options and nausea inducing locked FOV. The worst multiplayer and campaign in any Call of Duty title yet, the ghost of Infinity Ward has made it time and time again clear they don't care about PC gamers in any capacity beyond getting their money. The only thing this game has going for it is the Extinction mode, but even then if you want a FPS horde game there's plenty out there like it, and they'll run better, have better gameplay and come at a fraction of the cost.  If you want a good Call of Duty get Black Ops II, it has the sort of options a PC port of an FPS should have, it's a good game, and relatively hacker free in multiplayer thanks to Treyarch who have actually shown at least some level of competence in post release support of their game (that means anti-cheat, banning hackers, fixing bugs etc, not Â£12 packs of poorly designed maps so you can run around a slightly different area whilst getting killed by a teleporting aimbotter.)  If you're considering buying this because Infinity Ward made MW1 &amp; MW2, don't, because any of the talent Infinity Ward had has either moved on to Respawn or to various other studios after Activision cheated the developers out of their post MW2 completion bonuses."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is probably the worst new COD I have ever played. The choice of good weapons is slim and the tactics that people use aren't good. Jumping around and knifing everyone, using choices of weapons and attachments that don't make the game enjoyable for you, and people overall just ruin the game experience for you. The graphics are unmatched compared to what Battlefield 4 has to offer. Unfortunately, Battlefield 4 isn't avaliable on Steam , and I wish it was. The graphics in this game are absolutely horrible, unless you are on the highest setting. If you are on a lower setting than 'Extra' when it comes to texture quality, the game doesn't look good and the camos won't even look like camos! It still locks you at 30 FPS too! In conclusion, never buy an Infinity Ward Call of Duty, and wait for Treyarch or Sledgehammer to make a game that will actually be good. The only thing we get in this game is Fish AI in a horrible campaign. Good luck Infinity Ward, you shouldv'e given up after Modern Warfare 3. So glad Advanced Warfare is coming out soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So I played this sorry excuse for a Call of Duty for a total of 8 hours and I get a random developer ban with no reason why. I played thousands of hours on other Call of Duty titles that actually had effort put into it and this game was just horrible. The games went downhill pretty fast. After Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty kept spitting out bad quality to worse quality games over these last few years. I realize that IW has become the welfare parents of the video game industry; just spitting out children every 9 months with no regard of actually taking care of them after they are born."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks frustation simulator 2069
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE GAME IS BROKEN AND BAD! BUY IT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO WASTE 60$!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Stay away from this game. It's a badly optimized console port with high system requirements, old graphics, laggy and buggy multiplayer and boring singleplayer. Not worth your time nor your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Have in your mind that Black Ops II is very best!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PIECE OF S.H.I.T !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"1.) Game sucks my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  2.) I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ better games than this.  3.) I'll still play it. 4.) If you wouldn't pay $60 for a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ then dont buy this, because it's a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Single Player is pretty good. The Multi Player sucks really big donkey balls
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is probably the worst new COD I have ever played. The choice of good weapons is slim and the tactics that people use aren't good.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is so terrible it will make you hit the crapper, worst call of duty game ever made!! I play it only because I had already spent my money on it, but if you have not yet bought the game I advise not to purchase it!   Also.......  Dear people that play call of duty ghost, be prepared to get your money stolen from you... Activision are starting to ban innocent people that do not cheat! They will give no warning or proof in acknowledgement to why... Have fun while you can...   D-Emerald"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The singleplayer campaign is alright, online multiplayer is a whole different story. The online community is pretty much dead, last time I checked there were less than 400 people online and the majority only plays TDM so objective based playlists are mostly empty at this point, even FFA only had 12 active players when I last played it. Another problem with this game is because the TTK is so low camping seems to be the most rewarding playstyle so that's what most people are doing. The bland color scheme also makes it difficult to see your enemies, which usually makes for a very frustrating experience. I played this game on my 360 a couple of years ago and ended up selling it. Gave it a 2nd chance on pc and I still don't really like it. The singleplayer campaign has some cool moments but that's about it. It's just not a very good game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst Call of Duty game i have played. The textures is worse than thoes in CoD4. The game doesn't even run good at my computer with i7-4770k 3.50GHz, GTX 770 and 16GB RAM. Even with everything cranked up to extra, textures still looks bad.  There is too much particles so its extreamly hard to see the other players on some maps. So the game doesn't look good at all. Dark, gray, dull and with awfull graphics.   And one more thing that i really hate about this game is that you cant see your ping!  There is not ping-bar or anything.   So if you still wanna play CoD - Go play Black Ops 2 or CoD4. Not this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the best COD titles released in the franchise looks rather spiffy with the updated game engine and plays real nice. Shame it is a hackfest with cheaters in every lobby and nothing being done about them :*( This game has been bleeding players scince launch with the lack of anti-cheat being huge and no server admins scumbags just do as they please with zero repercusions. Atleast Treyarch tried and we could see they was upsetting the cheaters with lots of crying in the forums unfortunatly the same canot be said for this title and it is killing the game.  Untill something is done i refuse to play this yet more money given to Activision for another turd. shame on you InfinityWard   Still no Sli support for those of us that buy multiple VGA cards (at great cost) also this game is not very wel optimised at the time of writing this there are many with descent PC's that just cant run it.  Shame it could be good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game was really fun at first but now I'm hatting it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i swear a poop stick made this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game, I play it so much nearly everyday. The best part is the fact I always get 360 no scoped, it simply turns me on."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This have to be the worse Call of Duty game ever made! Campaign is boring as hell and the multiplayer is so annoying! So many hackers!! This game was not worth the money, how did they even get this game out when it sucks so bad? DONT BUY THIS GAME! 0/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player portion was just okay. Typical Call of Duty story: bad guy threatens America, you go in and blow stuff up.  Nothing special there. Multiplayer is horrible. I put about 15 minutes into it, which is 15 minutes too much. Upset I spent 60 dollars on this. Don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD Ghosts is the newest installment of the game series that consistently fails to address the gameplay problems of previous installments, while adding â€œrevolutionaryâ€ new features that add nothing to the quality of gameplay. To get the full experience, stab yourself repeatedly in the eyeballs and genitalia with a rusty HIV infected syringe and send me your $59.99 instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have played more than 500 hours at this game, I am participating to the clan wars, and I still play a lot with friends. But I do not recommend this game to those who don't have it yet.   Paradoxal, isn't it ? Let me explain why :   I was a fan of MW3 and, of course, I decided to buy this game, specially for clan wars. Now that I have it, I play it. It would be a waste of money not to play and I want to achieve all the goals in clan war before i quit playing this game. But for those who don't have it yet, I want to inform them about all the things that could disapoint them.  1) You need a very good PC to run it : I mean, even Battlefield 4 runs better than Ghosts ! And... it is not more beautiful than other COD games. Battlefield 3 or Crysis 1 's graphics are still better ! This is not my own opinion, this is the opinion of many players. So, if you want to play this game, prepare yourself to pay a lot for a new graphic card, etc.  2) map packs are not worth it : they are expensive and nobody plays it. Specially because new maps are not mixed with old ones. Because everyone is playing the old ones, it's getting harder and harder to find people to play on the new maps. For example : the free fall map was exclusively reserved for players who pre-ordered the game. 'They' finally had to make it free and playable for everyone because ABSOLUTELY NOBODY was playing it ! Season pass is not worth it too, because it does not even include coolest stuffs (and sometimes very useful ones) such as extra slots for loadouts, wolf skin for the dog, or captain price skin.  3) because fewer and fewer players are playing it, it is already more and more difficult to find players to play with. Only TDM and Domination are still played enough. Specially for clan wars, this lack of players will be a big problem.  4) clan war is a total failure. Because I was getting bored shooting on noobs when I was playing MW3, I got very excited when I heard about clan wars coming on Ghosts. I thought it would be a good occasion to meet and fight against best players, to participate to some kind of online competition. Good thing when you don't have the occasion to play in LAN or in real LAN tournaments. But Clan war is nothing like that. You don't fight other clans, you play as usual and the competition only counts the number of victories. The clan that gets the most victories during a certain time wins. So, clan war is just a 'who will kill the most noobs' competition. Except for diamond division, it is even a ' who will not sleep ' competition (because clans who sleep the less will, of course, play more and get more victories. Clan war is the most disapointing part of this game.  5) Hackers were a big problem. Every day, every night, there was at least one hacker every 4 or 5 matches. 'They' finally reacted and banned tons of them. But it was too late. Now, because of those massive bans, it's even more difficult to find players to play with. They should have made a system like : warnings first, then punitions like stats reset, and then Ban.  Morality : For those who have this game already, let's continue to enjoy playing it. The community is small on Steam, but we can still have fun. But for those who don't have it yet, please think twice. specially about the cost of this game, because it will include the upgrade of your PC (if you don't have a decent and very recent one). And, as mentionned above, the second biggest problem is the fact that less and less players are playing it, for all the reasons I explained : tons of good players who quit playing because of the cheaters, then, tons of cheaters who got banned, technical needs : not everyone can afford a so good PC for the moment, map packs that are dividing the community even more, and, last but not least : many players who leave for other good games such as BF4, Titan Fall,... and even old cod like MW3 (many of my friends went back to mw3) etc.  Best regards.  (Post Scriptum : I had a GTX 580, and I had to upgrado to GTX 780 to run it fully)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I want to love this game but too many problem, game is laggy has hell even lag at the main screen, it is clear that this game was not made with pc in mind, also too many hack and IW doing nothing about it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad game , full of cheaters/booters + DEM FUKIGN NOOB KIDS!!!!!!!!!! "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terribly optimized. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC port. Overall the game sucks.  Pros: ...  Cons: Infinity Ward
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy as hell, crap graphical settings, just crap all round."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What complete bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this is.  Won't even run since last update, waiting for Activision support is no use coz they take so long to come up with answers that don't work and you've tried them all before. Never had any probs with any other COD game I own. The game is not very well optimized. it runs really poorly. The graphics look terrible. I can no longer be bothered to write.  Ghosts = A terrible so callled COD game  I have uninstalled this piece of steaming dung from my PC. It refuses to work and no fix has ever been mentioned. I only hope a better job is done on the next COD game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First missions are boring, but they are getting better and better. Multiplayer is nice, but worse than in MW 3 or MW 2. Graphics is very, very wick. Worse than in CoD from 2009. Campaign is very short and the story isn' t as interesting i suspect. If you wonna play good FPS, buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 or Modern Warfare 3. They are cheaper and better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is nice but there cheaters everywhere and every 2nd player is a cheater some quys think activioson the **************  sells cheats/hacks to the player and there is nothing anticheat in the game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you acitvison
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No no no, to start it was ok but pretty soon the multiplayer became rife with cheaters and abusive players, again IW unleashes a broken game for pc players with no support and nothing as was promised. Do NOT buy this piece of crap!! This is my biggest regret of 2013."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(Multiplayer ONLY) This game was just terrible since the release date. Too much lag, not much customization to audio, and no one plays. Finally they put FOV slider in but worst $60 ever spent on a game. Gift it to someone you hate."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC port is terrible. Do not buy this laggy piece of junk.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love this game, I play it so much nearly everyday. The best part is the fact I always get 360 no scoped, it simply turns me on."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible,simply unintresting,lame,poor story.Broken gameplay and deserted multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an buggy, unoptimised sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very disappointed! They could have done a much better job at this, I like the maps but the coding is very buggy and requires a very beefy computer to run it at even decent settings, you have no control over FOV (Field of view)  Although they fixed the lag switch problem, now there is loads of hackers everywhere, I was really excited until it kept crashing :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You kidding right? recommend this game.  Connecting to online services majority of times takes minutes and mind you this is on 30MB up and 2MB down connection. IW and Steam seem to obviosly ignore the fact that there are still millions of issues with this game. This is rushed, terribly executed, non playable game, if you can even call it a game.  Swimming in millions and dropping crap like this on the market, have you no shame."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if i knew now how badly yet again we as customers are being let down by the people who are supposed to be admins for the servers id of saved my money, NOT a single thing is being done against the cheats in game, reporting is futile and accomplishing nothing.. i still see the same people using the same cheats, laughing and mocking people trying to play fairly, its a disgrace and one Activision and Iwnet should be ashamed of. I would HIGHLY recommend avoiding ANY future releases until they use a STAND ALONE ACP instead of one like Steam that requires SERVER ADMINS on DIDICATED SERVERS to be of any use. As Customers we are being totally lied to, ignored and basically â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of any money we have for the sake of profit and at the cost of online gaming FUN. If i was asked is CoD Ghosts worth getting id have to say NO.. if they cannot be bothered to ensure our gaming online is for the most part cheat free and show themselves to be actively doing something to combat it, then why should we bother to line their ever deepening pockets. You can ask Activision on twitter at @activision not that they would be any more reliable at acting on anything, in fact im sure they have by now perfected their replies .. 'we cannot reveal what we do' thats because you do NOTHING!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!: FPS is horrible game run's like shiza I get like fps drops from 80-29 it is 100% un-playable if you wanna play this game with smooth fps get a console. has Boring multiplayer, Same game everyear, extinction is horrible zombies was better, no one play's this game multiplayer is a ghost town. 60 doallers for this piece of garbage? It's the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everyear no gamechanger same multiplayer and feel it's gets boring really quickly. The only good thing is the campaing it was pretty good i'm not going to lie it was my favorite campaing out of all COD's. Also the graphics are pretty good. I really regret paying 60 doallers for this game it should cost 20 doallers. If you want a real crazy FPS shooter get Battlefield 4 or Counterstrike Global Offense.  Rate:6.1"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really want to like this game. Female characters are a great addition, but they don't look really feminine. They don't have to look like a doll, but right now they almost look like men. I also like the special events and how clanwars work. It is just sad that it only works with an app and that there is no other solution to it. But these are just small issues I have. A big downside is: It is full of hackers and it feels like nothing has been done about it. There is no real Anti-Cheat solution right now and that influences the game experience heavily. It is a fact that nowadays a lot of people try to break games to make it easier to achieve things and brag about it. Seems like they opened them every door to do so.  I wouldn't recommend buying this game right now. Unless you want to have a lot of frustrating moments. I really hope they will fix this soon. The amount of bad reviews is rediculous.  See you ingame...(I will still play this and hope for the best)  GunChi  AWW nice, Woman looks like a woman with DLC now !  But a half year later, no anti cheat program :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not waste any money on this pathetic excuse for a game. I bought this as a relatively cheap buy from a CD-keys website, which I have used before, and encountered no problems whilst doing so, with the service, or games supplied. I decided to buy this as I have always been a massive fan of the Battlefield franchise, and stopped playing Call of Duty after the release of Modern Warfare 3. I thought I would return to either justify the mocking this game has recieved or form my own opinion on it. Sadly this could not happen as I couldn't even launch the game. These crashes have been happening for people since November of last year, And I, today, in April 2014, am experiencing the same problem. My PC â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the minimum requirements for this game, and my drivers are up to date. Thats all I expect to have to worry about when playing a game. But Infinity Ward have other things in mind. They should be ashamed of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing disgrace. If you wanna buy this, do yourself a huge favour and..... Don't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an buggy, unoptimised sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,FOV and servers you dogs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THE WORST CALL OF DUTY EVER !!!! DON'T BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad COD game, and a horrible PC port. If you're looking for a good COD game for the PC, get Black Ops II instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please do not buy this game, you suffer regret straight after doing so."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First person shooter? Really? - This is a disgrace to the franchise and entire genre. Another 6 months and it might have been ready for release. Until you hear about a game changing patch from an INDEPENDENT source, dont waste your money!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The lamest shooter SP I've ever played. There is no story, there are cliches, and random illogical events, and you've already finished the 4 hour long campaign. The scripting is static, there is NOTHING dynamic in this game, unless you sit around and wait for the slow NPCs you will bump into them at every _damn_ door that needs to be kicked down, you will be teleported away between scripted events, just because you didn't stood still, and you will be insta-killed for -no actual reason- just because the scripted message: 'Don't go there yet, some more enemys spawned there like 0.1 sec ago' is two seconds late, UNLESS you sit, and wait around every time like a mentally capped zombie. MP: There is no actual recoil, the maps are way too small, and simple, altho you can choose from a lot of weapons pretty much all does the same damage with the same accuracy (except the big snipers obv.). Pointless killing around is fun for a couple of hours, but for 60â‚¬ .... no, thanks. There is no optimalisation. This game was made for consoles, meaning both the hardware requirements, and the intellectual requirements.  I honestly see no point in buying/playing this game. Just grab a previous one of the series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst COD I have ever played and it might be the worst FPS I've played. I'm running it on 24gb of ram on a 290x and a i7 proc and it still suffers from frame drops. I ran the SP just so I could write this review.. changing the video options kicked me back into the stupid intro movie every time.  I'd like to call the multiplayer part of this game COD : Clowns, because that's what it is. Running around with Hollywood characters to make up for horrid maps and horrid guns. Maps are too large and the guns kill to quickly. The perk system is a mess of complexity and the system for picking up challenges/briefcases is also just a mess.   The audio options has about as much depth as the irony video on YouTube (if Quake was done today) and in traditional IW manner you can't turn off annoying stuff like music in multiplayer. Basic stuff that was requested back in MW3. Well actually you can by renaming some music files in your library, I posted a tip about that in some reddit thread and to this day my blog post are some of the most popular posts when I look at the stats..  Their removal of the UAV does not work at all since you now never know what level of UAV the opposing force has, something that alters your gameplay in previous COD games (ie, if the enemy has an UAV up - be alert/or go with a stealth class...if they have a VSAT up, be stupidly alert). The maps also foregoes of the classic three lanes and instead turned everything into an effing mess making it impossible to do well in a consistent manner and rewards sitting on your behind too much.  More than anything though the visuals are cluttered and foes are hard to spot. It stutters and has frame drops no matter on what system you run it. Maxfps settings are gone and the FOV slider was too little too late.  I don't see myself buying an IW game ever again and I will not pre-order another COD title until I see proof positive of how well they perform on PC, has maxfps settings, soild settings for mouse sensitivity (F the freaking slider, if I want 1.004 then let me).  The only thing that is good about this game is the movement system and the hit detection, wich they fussed up anyway since all that big talk about dedicated servers was just plain horse dung..more often than not you are running on hosts as opposed to BO2 wich has ded servers only for PC.  Just to write this review I ran SP for like 5 mintues. It crashed twice. Well done IW, well done. Stick your silly camos, your brotastic tier-1 crap and utter arrogance far up where the sun don't shine."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No i do not recommend this game to anyone. At least not at the price they are asking since this COD has been the biggest failure for PC ever. I pre ordered this game and have tried playing both single and multi players. I liked the single player but the multiplayer is a piece of crap. The maps on the highest settings are not really graphic at all, Frame rates drop on you all the time, Ping bar is missing so you can't even tell if you are lagging because of your connection to ping due to it not even being there, Spawns are horrible, and i mean horrible i have had soo many times where my enemy spawns no more than 2 feet beside me, i am not joking. Map layouts are horrible and i still have not even had a mp match on the supposed free fall map which i did try out by myself in private match and found that map not to even be half what was promised. There are no servers at all only quickmatches by activision. Also when you try to find a match you are lucky to even find 15 lobbies on a good day in TDM. I am serious, i rememeber MW3 BO2 all of these had 60+ lobbies to join well into their life. Even now i can open MW3 and find more quickmatch lobbies for TDM then i can find in COD Ghost. Ghost was a joke, They have fixed ram issues and several boot up issues but the gameplay issues are still the same.  If any of you were expecting the gameplay to be anything like the modern warfare series, then you are in for a surprise. It is what i would call a half breed between the MW series and the BO series. People bought this because they wanted MW series type of gameplay. Others buy BO series because they like that better. Well this one mixed both and it is rotton horrible. If Infinity ward doesn't fix this game then i will skip CODs from here on till i find another proven good one. I am looking forward to 'Enemy Front' and 'Homefront 2' by Crytek. Well this is the end of my review of this game and i really hope they fix these issues because i paid $60 pre order for nothing. I still play more MW3 than i do in this game."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 would never play again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I want to like this game. I really do. But this when the game crashes 10 seconds in any match, you really regret buying this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Compensation lag; dont listen to the naysayers. It exists. Deliberate or not I dont care, but it has completely tarnished the multiplayer experience. I kept playing to perk up and develop squad points believing that it would improve my multiplayer experience. Maybe my gun wasnt spec'd out enough? Maybe I didnt have the right perks? What a waste of time.  And to be honest I only started playing the multiplayer because the single player campaign wont let me proceed past a certain point without a CTD. You see each previous time the game C'dTD, if I restarted it and tried again, 1 out of 5 times would be successful. Only until I reached a point in the game that I just cant seem to get past without a CTD. In all of this madness, I felt I needed to get my money's worth. So I switched to MP. But my sole multiplayer experience was serving as cannon-fodder to those with a poorer internet connection; the ones who benefited most from compensation lag.  I had several COD games on my wish list. No longer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There is no aspect of this game that doesn't run like a mentally challenged horse on amphetamine. Don't bother.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Waste of money. Even main menu is lagging.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Jezus, when will they stop this cr*p. I decided to give CoD another chance. Well, this is sh*t. I only played it because I wasted money on it. The story is sh*t, the weapons suck and are very unbalanced, and the multiplayer feels like its an autistic baby from black ops and modern warfare. Why not actually spent time working on a good game, instead of producing a new one every f*cking year??  4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The singleplayer story is great. The multiplayer maps and weapons are terrible.  If you love to be killed by perks, mines, air strikes and so on every 2 seconds, then this game is a good buy for you!  The graphic looks the same as Call of Duty 4. This game needs a graphic update for sure!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"GOOD: - Campaign + Multiplayer + Extinction!  - Eminem &amp; Snoop Dogg made video and song about this and have voice pack - Pssh... sellouts. - Extinction. No one ever told me there's aliens in Call of Duty... It's like a replacement for Zombies but with aliens. It's a whole lot better than zombies, in my opinion because zombies just 1 hit you = dead. - Soundtracks   BAD: - Not many players - Bans you for changing FoV - Bad graphics. Same graphics from MW2. - Message of the day / Begs you to buy newer CoD games and DLCs - Everything is the same from previous games. For example, when closing / opening the door, it uses the very very old sound effect, most notably from Max Payne 2001. From Modern Warfare 2 to this, everything is the same. The animations notably when killing an enemy, is the same animation triggered from CoD4. - Poorly optimized. I have GTX 960 12gb ram, i5 6600k and the game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Remember the forest mission? That was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing painful to play as I play only like 40 frames per second. - Bad video advertising. It has good graphics (pun intended), idiotic characters on campaign? Did you know what this means? They're trying to advertise us that makes it looks like we can have coop campaign.  Also, what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ does this have to do with Riley from Modern Warfare series? EVERYBODY likes him and are so obsessed that some soldiers in the army have that ghost scarf like his.   3/10 It's a bad COD game.   I however liked the campaign and extinction. I give extinction and campaign 9/10. Especially the space mission. It made me curious about space and stuff (if sounds can travel, if there gonna any be war in space, etc)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you hate your life and gaming buy this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Came in expecting to get spooked by a ghost, but the game was too bad for that to happen. 1/10, at least it has Fish AI."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,We all complain about call of duty but this one is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.     -Sayed 'Helpful' Man
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another Call of Duty, except IW treats us like absolute crap with this title  Disgusting Port can barely play it  Campign is a rehash of Modern Warfare 2  2D Fire 40GB AAA game with 2D fire did i metion this game has 2D fire? oh and no VAC so cheat all you want with the 800 people who still plays this trash"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would rather Cut my own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off then play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again! WOrst Game is history!!!! WHERES MY REFUND! I give it -1/10 HACKERS EVERYWHERE!!! WORST GAME IN THE HISTORY OF GAMES EVER, I STILL CANT BELIEVE THIS WAS IN COMPETITION WITH BATTLE FIELD 4 Call of Duty Ghosts Producers GO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOUR SELF!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign was alright up to a point. I can't progress past this point as the game will never, ever get past the next level's loading screen. Every single time, it freezes.   There are numerous fixes posted, none do anything. The game also looks absolutely terrible for a given performance setting. I.e. to get smooth FPS, you have to make it look like Nintendo 64. Black Ops 2 looks and runs great on high, same system.  I hear the multiplayer is dead. Just watch a let's play and save yourself the money. Terrible."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This could be the biggest piece of garbage i have ever played.  Same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ spawn system as in MW3. Got hacked 3 days befor the release, awfull class system and just the whole game in general is awfull. It's MW3 Vista. This is The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ brother of MW3 and i strongly recommend some other FPS as TF2 or CS:GO or BF4 over any of the cod games.  MW series got way to many hackers and BO is an bad attempt to copy BF3.  2 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CoD games a row made me completly lose faith in this series so bye bye CoD"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Looking at the number of people playing Ghosts you'd think the game was a couple of years old. Ghosts has been out for less than half a year and already it's hard to get into a lobby on some of the game modes.  Matches without connectivity problems are few and far between. The lack of players doesn't exactly help.  Worst of all, the game is terribly optimized. It doesn't matter how badass your PC is, if you crank up the video settings the game will stutter. It doesn't even look all that good maxed out. And I can't begin to describe how bad Ghosts look on the lowest settings. Imagine playing Goldeneye on the Wii with the TV screen covered in snot, it's far worse than that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A frenetic, fast-paced shooter with a cheap blockbuster, explosion-filled singleplayer campaign and long-lasting multiplayer. This formula hasn't been changed in 6 years. If you were buying Ghosts hoping for a revolution, like I did, you will be dissapointed like no Asian dad ever was, when their son brought Fs home. If you came expecting something quick that would keep you occupied and like all the millitary stuff, you shall enjoy this game. The multiplayer hasn't changed as well. The enemy will still spawn on you from time to time. You will still get shot in the back and from the side for no reason. And you will get yelled on by a tween, stating he had intercourse with your dear mother. Gameplay flaws aside, there are the TECHNICAL ones. The ridiculous RAM requirement (was fixed from 6 GB down to 4), the occasional LAGS (if you look from side to side you get tearing), especially on startup of a match. And it doesn't even look that good to have the right to drop framerates. It's seriously not optimized for PCs. Checked on both a fairly low-end notebook and a mainstream, capable gaming desktop. It's the kind of port-it-from-the-xbox-and-slap-it-on-windows port. I realized I made a mistake AFTER purchasing this game. Have I tried it before, I would go with Treyarch's installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. Overall, the game is enjoyable and the campaign is truly epic, but the technical problems and the slowly-getting-old gameplay mechanics are something that will probably bug the most of players, who are familiar with the CoD franchise or FPS in general. For your first Call of Duty, this is not a bad pick, however."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WAIST OF MONEY, IF I COULD I WOULD RETURN IT AND GET MY MONEY BACK."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can only comment on the multiplayer part of the game, so far, but the experience I've gotten has been fairly consistent.  The game started out really bad on PC. Horrendous performance and optimization on top on some good ideas and stuff that simply didn't work out. Sadly, none of the patches have helped to minimize the problems or decrease them to a comfortable level.  Especially in comparison to the stellar performance of Black Ops 2, this has to be the, by far, worst PC part of the Call of Duty series. If you're a multiplayer fan, simply stay away from it. I'd seriously doubt it would ever get to the point of being playable. Especially now as DLC started to drop in and players subsequently dropping out.  As a big fan of the series I'd always recommend getting World at War or any of the Black Ops titles. The first two Modern Warfare games were very good also. But this one? Stay away from it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"By far the worst Call of Duty game to date. The only people still playing it, it seems, are the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that made people hate all of the other Call of Duty games. Still looks like Modern Warfare, yet has unjustifiably bad performance. This game has definitely cured me of my Call of Duty addiction. Titanfall here we come!  For some reason I keep revisiting this game every month or so to see if it has gotten better. Seems all they are able to do is make it worse. This was definitely the last time I will do that.  I never leave reviews for games, but this one is just so deserving of a bad review that I had no choice. I do not recommend this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The singleplayer campaign is really nice made, i liked it. But that is also the end of what i liked. The mulitplayer just looks like something made for 4-5 years ago. You are better off listening to some music than gun sounds. It is just so badly made. The extinction mode is just not worth playing alone. You either run out of ammo really fast and can't reload because the aliens are attacking or you knife the sh*t out of them and hope for the best. And squads. WTF Activision?!? What is this sh*t?   Overall. Just DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Unless you wanna spend 60 bucks for a nice single campaign.  â˜…â˜…"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buggy (Crashes most times I play it, on resume, or loading the next bit)  Laggy (During video the sound and picture go out of sequence, so you see the punch, count to six and hear the punch.)  AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (They run at right angles and don't have fluid motion)  Some points are impossible (Because you have to hit keys at exactly the right moment) Plot (I still don't know what is going on and I have played 6 hours) Old school graphics (Not great for 2014, but for 2007 rally good)  Overall - Glad I got it in the sale. Certainly not worth the DLC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not worth the money! i only play squads just to try to get my moneys worth from the game. everything is P2P matching, so many lost games to the host quitting, outrageous pings, and less reputable players. no real anti cheat in place, no dedi's. will never again believe a word from activision, treyarch, infinity ward. CoD has died. first week saw 35k to 40k players online, not bad. now lucky to see any where near 15k online. says a lot. shoot, BO2 has shown a major increase in players over the past week or so. proves how bad ghosts really is."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS: - better graphics - not the 6 bullets death â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t anymore  CONS: - Clearly just copy pasted from previous parts - couple new things, but nothing changed majorly - badly ported from the xbox - they didnt put enough time and effort in pc version  Other words, activision is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for making this abomination.  dont buy it unless its like 20 euro max."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dear Activision,  Please stop your developers from making Call of Duty (The game I once loved playing for countless hours) into something that is complete poo.     Yours Truly,  Duff c:"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's god awful
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't waste your money....  Another COD without dedicated servers.  Way to go COD, you screwed us over again lying pieces of crap!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts, Infinity Ward showing the world how lazy they are. This game has the most pathetic PC port for it being a 'Next Gen' title. The graphics are not indicative of the money spent on this game, neither is the story or the gameplay. The story is short, I played through it slowly and it took me six hours. Thats pathetic. The multiplayer is awful, there is NO playerbase, the connections are awful, the gameplay is choppy. If you buy this game, you will regret it so spend the money on something that works. Infinity Ward spent many millions of dollars to 'make' this game, yet im amazed at how little actually went into it. They took the ending from MW2 and reskinned it, they took the engine from Black Ops 2 and downgraded it. This is the biggest scam of a 'new' game that i have ever had the misfortune of being caught by. Hopefully others are luckier."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game that made me think first: 'what are they doing?' This game is not finished and requires really good pc to even run without problems. CoD: ghosts focuses on intregrated attachments and AI controlled Bot killstreaks (dog, juggernaught and so on...) If you are going to buy any CoD game, do not buy this at full price. It's not worth it(i bought it half price and i haven't played it much compared to earlier ones). If you are going to buy any CoD game, I would recommend earlier cod's(black ops and modern warfare series.) Extinction is a nice extra add but i don't find it as entertaining as Black ops zombies. Multiplayer is not the greatest (actually the worst that i have ever played) but someone likes it, but i don't anymore. And there is no way to see your ping! Singleplayer is avarage, it would have been better but it's still playable.   Everything in one sentence: Do not buy it if you don't have good gaming pc or connection.  Extinction. 6/10 Multiplayer. 3/10 Singleplayer. 6/10 (*Updated*)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can only comment on the multiplayer part of the game, so far, but the experience I've gotten has been fairly consistent.  The game started out really bad on PC.

As a big fan of the series I'd always recommend getting World at War or any of the Black Ops titles. The first two Modern Warfare games were very good also. But this one? Stay away from it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a very poor effort for COD. The laggiest version of COD so far, this game even has massive lag on the menus even before you get into multiplay. The lack of dedicated servers for a game like this is a joke and shows the emphasis is on console gaming rather than PC gaming. If you already have one of the games in the COD series, I wouldn't bother getting this one as it brings nothing new. Known issues like bad spawning and lag have not been addressed and it feels like it was rushed out. Overall a poor effort :-("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the most terible COD Games in this series and terrible optimization.  Freeze, framedrop, lags and crashing.  Graphic problems is also included. Sometime I have played for 15-20 minutes and this game was poor graphic. I have to restart game to continue game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There's just so many things to criticize this game about... So, the first thing. Optimization. I'm running a high end computer with over the required 6gb of RAM. I have 16. I also have a GTX 770 which should easily cap this game on ultra settings. I didn't get what I expected. I'm getting around 60fps and then I get sudden dips to 20 for no apparent reason. This happens every minute of gameplay but it is still VERY annoying. The next problem this game suffers from is the map sizes. These maps are becoming pretty big. Just stay with the same map size, nobody said that small maps were bad. Battlefield is from making big maps. The campaign really saves the game from what I've played but the game is mainly based around multiplayer which is something in which IW has failed terribly. This game is also missing a FOV Slider. I don't know why but every Call of Duty game that IW makes is just missing so many things that the Treyarchs version isn't. The week this game came out, there were a lot of hackers around already. I also have to download 3rd party programs to do something that I should be able to just adjust IN GAME. The graphics are simply, terrible. Yes, I agree that they've finally made that move from the previous generation of Call of Duty games but come on... These aren't the 'next gen graphics' that we were talking about. The graphics aren't even compressed and they still manage to look somewhat terrible. This game is also filled with campers but I can't blame IW for that. My biggest problem is the fact that the main menu lags. Lags a lot. So does the mouse when you play the campaign. I was getting a lot of what is know as microstutter but I was playing without SLI. This is the thing that really annoys me about this game. The people at IW have a lot of money. More than you can imagine and they also have a huge fanbase. The fanbase gives constructive criticism but IW doesn't do anything about this. I remember tweeting to a person who is meant to take criticism from fans and I ended up being blocked. Oh yes, did I mention, I get over 60 fps on ultra settings in Battlefield 4 but get a lot less on Ghosts? I play Ghosts on medium by the way. It just seems that for this generation of shooters, I'm going to stick with Battlefield 4 and I also recommend that you do so too.   Game rating: 2 / 10 Campaign Saved the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"one of, if not, the worst call of duty of all times do not get this it is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and does not deserve to be a call of duty titled game. CoD has made better with little more equipment they have had in the past all i can say is giant waste of my money on this game. for all the people that dont have this game you are lucky you still have your money.     &lt;----- FAIL!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What a bad port!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"game is fun, but the FPS is horrible and the RAM usage is ridiculous, sort it IW"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player = win Multiplayer as with every IW game = epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!! Game has no more than 10000 players, very hard to get a game. If your a HC fan you will be sorely dissapointed. Hackers every where not even trying to hide it because IW does nothing to stop them, reporting a player does nothing. Simply put IW no longer cares about the PC community as we are such a small part of the sales. If you spend the money on this game after reading all the reviws then you have no one to blame but yourself."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PC multiplayer is absoulutely filled with cheaters, and Activision/IW clearly does NOT care - they haven't lifted a finger to do anything about the poor gaming experience that PC players have as a result of the cheaters, nor have they even publicly admitted there's a problem.  They actually seem to be on the cheaters' side, having stripped us of any and all power to deal with them (reporting does literally nothing, dedicated servers are gone so we can't kick them out ourselves, and to top it off, Friendly Fire isn't even an option in the game anymore so we're permanently stuck in kiddie mode!).  This is bad enough by itself...but then you add the horrendous 'game matching system' where you'll sometimes sit for 10 minutes just to find a game, even though there's 12,000 players online - skip this title. There are several reasons many veterans have gone back to playing the OLDER versions (BO2, MW3).  Personally, I'm done with Hacktivision."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I pre-ordered this on Steam, after all, the previous games had been fun, not without faults, but still fun! Well, that was 40 quid wasted! Don't get me wrong, the single player game was OK, but waaaaay too short. The multiplayer on the other hand is a complete waste of time! Where to start? Lag/stuttering, call it what you will - it's like watching a poorly made stop-motion animation! There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to how you get kills. I've emptied clips into opponents, only to be killed with a hard stare. It can be so unbalanced as to be almost vertical. Various forum posts will tell you to turn off this or that, or even that your PC just ain't good enough. A mate has a dogs boll$&amp;ks gaming rig and even he binned it after a week. As the the hackers/cheaters/script kiddies, call 'em what you will. In the last 10 games I've played I've been against 6 hackers - they're easy to spot as they have every perk and upgrade going, can kill you from the other side of the map through half a dozen concrete walls and tend to have k/d scores like 75/2. Also, they tend to boast about it as IW and Activision don't ban these idiots. If you go to the forums to complain they just give you a stock answer about reporting them ingame. Well, sorry guys, it's been a fun ride. But if this is the way AV and IW want to treat PC gamers then there are other companies out there who I'd prefer to give my money to. Now, what's this BF4 everyone seems to be on about?..."

Its multiplayer is a nightmare and does not even deserve to compete with Battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"netcode - bad. lagger wins, bad graphics unless setting to extra, full of hackers - no vac - cant detect simple payed hacks, no dedicated servers.   simple words: buy black ops 2  NEVER PRE-ORDER A GAME AGAIN...!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The source of all my regrets. I want my $60 back.   Crap optimization accompanied with a 4-month wait for a FoV slider- But oh wait, it only goes up to 80 and will randomly bounce down to 65 without warning.  It took a bit of scouring the internet (mostly Reddit) to find a proper optimization guide. A computer surpassing all requirements can't even run the damn game on max settings.  Not to mention community FoV changers were all of a sudden considered hacks even though previous titles such as Modern Warfare 2 and 3 had accepted them with open arms (and official approval for MW3). FPS-cap removers also considered HAX.  Story was really bad too. Dog got shot. He lived but was removed from duty. Dog should have been main character, at least he has a valid opinion.  *barks*"

Not to mention community FoV changers were all of a sudden considered hacks even though previous titles such as Modern Warfare 2 and 3 had accepted them with open arms (and official approval for MW3). FPS-cap removers also considered HAX.  Story was really bad too. Dog got shot. He lived but was removed from duty. Dog should have been main character, at least he has a valid opinion.  *barks*"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Remember this is only my own view of the game! I bought the Limited Edition of this game with the 'special' Free Fall Map. I was so excited to play this game and it turned out to be bad. The Multiplayer is lame and slow paced. Black Ops 2 was fast paced which made the gameplay fun. The Extinction Mode seems fine to me but is hard if you get a team of idiots. The campaign was alright but only the ending bothered me. I paid 50 bucks only for a campaign. I wouldn't recommend that game if you ask me. Infinity Ward got some interesting DLC packs no doubt but why should I buy DLCs if the main game sucks. Some people like it some people don't. I belong to the people who dislike this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible. I've played this game on a near daily basis for over 3 months. I have 175 hours of gameplay. The games storyline is boring, drawn out and after 10 minutes i had to stop. The multiplayer is the worst experience i've ever had in my gaming career. The multiplayer only averages 1000-2000 players (worldwide) online at a time (that speaks amazingly for the online experience alone). It is more or less a pre-Alpha, half developed sloppy mess. Most of your time will be sitting in a lobby waiting to play. And when you get in a game, about 90% of every lobby has an ESP hacker or aimbotter. This is because the multiplayer has absolutely no anti-cheat engine. and to top it off, every game you play whether its full of hackers or regular players, youll have a team-based lag depending on who the game decides is the 'best host'. If i were to give this game a critic rating score, it would be a -2/10, not because I hate it, or because im 'mad bro', its because this game was not completely developed upon release. And the creators have not fixed any problems since its release, but they have had time to add purchasable content which i find to be funny."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is terrible,wish I never bought it. I am done with the COD franchise, the only thing that makes it worst then buying this crap is is me not being able to get a refund from Steam because steam doesnt refund people. Never again!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I personally do not recommend buying this game, $60.00 USD is to much for a poorly optomized and overall machine bogging game.  Multiplayer: 3/10 Campaign: 6/10 Extinction: 8/10  The best and most redeeming part of this game is Extinction, it's a bit more thought out than Black Ops 2 Zombies, and is the sole purpose I have the amount of hours in the Multiplayer part."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WAIST OF MONEY, IF I COULD I WOULD RETURN IT AND GET MY MONEY BACK."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS: - better graphics - not the 6 bullets death â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t anymore  CONS: - Clearly just copy pasted from previous parts - couple new things, but nothing changed majorly - badly ported from the xbox - they didnt put enough time and effort in pc version  Other words, activision is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for making this abomination.  dont buy it unless its like 20 euro max."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not worth the money! i only play squads just to try to get my moneys worth from the game. everything is P2P matching, so many lost games to the host quitting, outrageous pings, and less reputable players. no real anti cheat in place, no dedi's. will never again believe a word from activision, treyarch, infinity ward. CoD has died. first week saw 35k to 40k players online, not bad. now lucky to see any where near 15k online. says a lot. shoot, BO2 has shown a major increase in players over the past week or so. proves how bad ghosts really is."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buggy (Crashes most times I play it, on resume, or loading the next bit)  Laggy (During video the sound and picture go out of sequence, so you see the punch, count to six and hear the punch.)  AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (They run at right angles and don't have fluid motion)  Some points are impossible (Because you have to hit keys at exactly the right moment) Plot (I still don't know what is going on and I have played 6 hours) Old school graphics (Not great for 2014, but for 2007 rally good)  Overall - Glad I got it in the sale. Certainly not worth the DLC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've played black ops and mw3 in our local leagues and refuse to play this year as Ghosts is now the title they moving forward with.   What upsets me the most is I pre-ordered this game! Graphics are a step backwards, controls feel slugish and aiming feels horrendous! Menu lags and wow SP has such a weak story line it's not even funny. Nothing about this games is appealing!   Rather buy BF4 or wait for titanfall to come out. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Theres nothing new and exciting about this game. Looks like a repeat of mw3 even though they said they have changed the engine i don't see it. Game play is as to be expected without dedi servers and dont forget about the joys of hackers who openly tell you they are cheating and still not banned. I think meta crtic was to kind giving it a 68. Single player is also a joke takes about 3 to 4 hours. not worth the cash imo let alone paying for the extra maps they charge for save your cash on this one!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A frenetic, fast-paced shooter with a cheap blockbuster, explosion-filled singleplayer campaign and long-lasting multiplayer. This formula hasn't been changed in 6 years. If you were buying Ghosts hoping for a revolution, like I did, you will be dissapointed like no Asian dad ever was, when their son brought Fs home. If you came expecting something quick that would keep you occupied and like all the millitary stuff, you shall enjoy this game. The multiplayer hasn't changed as well. The enemy will still spawn on you from time to time. You will still get shot in the back and from the side for no reason. And you will get yelled on by a tween, stating he had intercourse with your dear mother. Gameplay flaws aside, there are the TECHNICAL ones. The ridiculous RAM requirement (was fixed from 6 GB down to 4), the occasional LAGS (if you look from side to side you get tearing), especially on startup of a match. And it doesn't even look that good to have the right to drop framerates. It's seriously not optimized for PCs. Checked on both a fairly low-end notebook and a mainstream, capable gaming desktop. It's the kind of port-it-from-the-xbox-and-slap-it-on-windows port. I realized I made a mistake AFTER purchasing this game. Have I tried it before, I would go with Treyarch's installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. Overall, the game is enjoyable and the campaign is truly epic, but the technical problems and the slowly-getting-old gameplay mechanics are something that will probably bug the most of players, who are familiar with the CoD franchise or FPS in general. For your first Call of Duty, this is not a bad pick, however."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"By far the worst Call of Duty game to date. The only people still playing it, it seems, are the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that made people hate all of the other Call of Duty games. Still looks like Modern Warfare, yet has unjustifiably bad performance. This game has definitely cured me of my Call of Duty addiction. Titanfall here we come!  For some reason I keep revisiting this game every month or so to see if it has gotten better. Seems all they are able to do is make it worse. This was definitely the last time I will do that.  I never leave reviews for games, but this one is just so deserving of a bad review that I had no choice. I do not recommend this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is NOT a good multiplayer for the Call of Duty series.   I've TRIED to have fun with it, but it seems too damn right impossible. Now, I'm going to talk about how well the game runs.  Frame rate: Not bad, not good. Field of view (FOV): Locked at 65. (Quite horrible, because most games should have at LEAST a field of view of 80, but I prefer 100 or so. As should most people.) Port: Very bad. Very bad indeed. (mainly to do with random stuttering on my beast of a machine.) Textures: They look like Modern Warfare 2 and older.  Dont waste your money on this crappy port, buy Black Ops 2 instead, it's a better game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wow, the ridculous aspect of recycling game assets hits its pinnacle with Call of Duty Ghosts. I've played them all, ever since the original PC release over ten years ago. Although the single player is fairly decent, yet still forgettable; the multiplayer was an absolute disaster in every way. The maps were designed to appeal to the worst sort of player in the Call of Duty community: The clinically insane. You know the type. The bat-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ crazy, bouncing off the walls, 'tigh-maps' lunatics that can't sit still for more than 2 seconds. These are the people who typically have their mic open the whole time spewing all kinds of hate and typically get more profane the more I kick their asses. A release for the terrible gamers out there. Unfortunately, they have become the mainstream COD gamers. The graphics were atavisitc in the MP mode. The worst case of consolitis I've ever seen.  The multiplayer was a massive disappointment the overshadowed the whole game. Perhaps it's time for the franchise to go away? Only time will tell, with the release of Advanced Warfare, if some respect can be salvaged in this series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its CRAP!!, NEVER buy a CoD game from this bunch of crooks!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,About as enjoyable as a swift kick to the scrotum. Terrible pc port
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Innovative, balanced, diversified, fun. All adjectives, which are not associated with this game.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is bad it has the record for the quikest time i ever got bored of a cod. this game causes lag even though my pc can handle these bad graphics this is a terrible pc port from infinity ward i would give this game a 1/10, I hate cod and this is the WORST thing that has came out of infinity Wards Â£Â£Â£Â£ craving mouth, my pc can handle BF3 on it's highest settings at 120 FPS yet this 2006 looking game runs at 16 FPS. So to round this up, if you like un original bad looking games that run at 16 FPS then buy this game, if not then keep your hard earned money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst CoD I've ever played. 1/10. One point for the dog.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Broken Game Of The Year! :-)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,       quality game 1/10 uninstalled&nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The story line, while really nothing new, was pretty enjoyable and I do quite love extinction but-   The main multiplayer is utter crap, in my opinion.   The game itself is terribly optimized, tries too hard to take all your resources, causing it to lag more.   The IED in HC is insanely overpowered, due to its huge blast radius and-  The spawns. oh lawdy, lawdy, the spawns. Awful, just awful. I have had so very many moments where I spawned right in front of the enemy.  My last part is purely personal preference.  Gameplay style. You basically must camp. No other option. I like to run and gun. I have a horrible attention span. I could blame it on my ADHD but, I won't. I am an impatient son of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. My reflexes are good enough to get me through well on most games. This one however, due to the lag caused by poor optimization, renders my reflexes moot and useless.  Therefore. For the reasons I have mentioned before I would not recommend this game until many more fixes are released.   Also if you like to run and gun. Bad news. Unlike MW3 where it was still possible, this one is much harder to do so on. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD ever!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Best thing baout this game was the fish AI, and even that was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing burn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS IS JUST NUCLEAR WASTE. DONT BUY THIS.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Believe it or not, the campaign is actually good.  It's just that all other aspects are so dull and stupid - not to mention the zombies copy-off: 'Extinction'.    Pretty meh, only would recommend if on sale, or buy it off â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or something for cheaper.  &lt;$20 would be alright for this game - but I still wouldn't go for it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really disappointed with this game. I was a fan of COD series but MP is a joke. Crappy gfx even with everything on highest. The nasty head bobbing when you run is just aweful. Its not smooth like in black ops2, It hurts my eyes. It just feels a cheap 20 dollar game. SP seems okay for what I played, but dont really care for sp. Thank god Battlefield 4 is a decent title. Even if has glitches, it is a much better game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am so let down I could CRY. I was feeling like a big shot when i bought my 1,000 gaming PC. I thought to my self now i can play COD the way it was ment to be played.....WRONG. This is just the worst. I installed it and deleted it....Then like a glutton for punishment i installed it again thinking they fixed it. Nope. They took my money and ran. I wish METRO LL had multiplayer cause if it did I wouldnt be typing this."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty ever. Infinity Ward â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up with this one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is further proof that Activision has absolutely no idea what it's doing anymore. The single player is 4-7 hours long, depending on your skill level, and is full of the same trite bull. It's a glorified shooter-on-rails. Put, click, and shoot.  The multiplayer portion of the game is what really ruins the game, in my opinion, however. It's buggy as hell, for starters, and lag seems to be an issue no matter how decent a connection every player in a given lobby has. To boot, as with every CoD game in the last decade, hackers make their appearances in droves. The difference with Ghosts, however, is that no one is doing a damn thing about it. Within the first three months of Ghosts, it's already as shabby and hacked-apart as MW3 was in it's last months. Steam doesn't do anything about it (and why should they, it's not their game), and Activision has, once again, put aside the pleas of its fans and left out any sort of hacker control. No votekick, no PunkBuster, nothing. For any legitimate players, your choices soon dwindle down to playing against Bots, which have neither skill nor allows for any real EXP gain.  The most frustrating factor to me, however, is how terribly the servers are. First, we never really got those dedicated servers that were promised before launch, did we? No, all we got was this terrible hybrid system that disallows for any control over who and where you play. Even worse, though, is that, because you have no way to look for servers, you're stuck, just as in MW3, waiting for a lobby to find enough players to launch. For sometimes as much as half an hour at a time.  Ultimately, Ghosts is a tired and vain game, with nothing new or fun to offer its players. Don't make the mistake that I made: don't buy Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A game that was highly anticipated but was poorly executed. The major issues are Gameplay,Menu Lag,Sound problems. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game blows... laggy as hell, and too many hackers!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game does not live up to my expectations. However, the campaign is very well-written and the multiplayer is as intense as it used to be back i the older games. But why won't I recommend this game then? Well, the biggest problem is that nothing 'really' new has happened. Yes, they've made a few cool changes to the perk-system but honestly once you get used to that, you realize that the perks you can choose are pretty much the same. The second largest problem is their way of designing maps in multiplayer. In the older games (here I think mainly of MW1 and MW2) the multiplayer maps were taken right out of the campaign and put into multiplayer to be used in different game-types. For players like myself, who loved playing both the campaign and the multiplayer that gave the maps a kind of 'homely' feeling. The maps back then had better design and felt more intuitive.  As I see it they've run out of ideas and have begun running in circles instead, just destroying a once good formula for a game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty ever. Infinity Ward â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up with this one.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have owned and thoroughly enjoyed every COD From the beginning up until COD:Black OPS1. Ghosts single player was fun for the short time it lasted. What I usually buy COD for is the Multiplayer. After BO1, the multiplayer sytems SUCK!  The only reason I tried Ghosts was due to the LIE that they would have dedicated servers. The first month of playing against HACKERS who had cheats on the day of the release of the game made me quit. During the first month playing, I was unfortunate enough to get stuck in a hacked lobby at level 41 only to come out at 60. 'LUCKILY' for me, six months later when I gave this crap network code another attempt, I was not one of the ones who had been perma banned due to the first six months of hackers ruining it for the honest players, I merely had to go back to Level 1. Thanks. So, having hated wasting the money, I try again. The maps are good, the weapons are good, the cusomizations are good. The matchmaking system STILL SUCKS. IF you are luky enough to find an open lobby, you have a good chance of getting sucked into a foreign host, and then you are gonna die alot. People cry hack left and right, but its just the crappy host system! It can't help but be biased. PLEASE bring back RENTABLE servers. People can find ones that work well for them, that are close to them. The Run and Gunners can play their style. The Snipers can play their style, The Tactical Servers can have their style. Heck, even the racists can have their own servers and call each other the N word all game long! I game to relax and have fun, not to have some twelve year old who just leaned their four letter words curse everyone out every time they get owned. I am gonna play this one out until it dies (and with a mesley 80-90 hardcore players online at night lately, it might not be long) but I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MULTIPLAYER GAME WITHOUT RENTABLE SERVERS."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Full of cheaters, they seem to never get banned. not a great game, slow too"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,wasting my time to post a review for this shityy game .. yukk!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-awful. -want money back. -framerate is terrible, even on lowest settings. -no optimization for PC. -at most 6000 players online ever -peer to peer lag is awful -still matchmaking, on a PC game, i mean come on, it's 2014, get with it, no pc gamer wants this. -most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weapons, like a revolving shotgun and the M4 just rehashed over and over -lame killstreaks -the chainsaw is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  -akimbo is somehow still a thing, have you ever seen a real operator do this? -the whole 'ghosts' thing gets VERY cliche'd -i would get more fun out of this much money spent at laser tag."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"1. Go to your library. 2. Find Call Of Duty: Ghosts/ Call Of Duty: Ghosts Multiplayer and right click on either one. 3. Find the tab that says 'Delete Local Content' and click on it. 4. A small page should open up on your screen, it will say something like 'Are you sure?' and you're going to want to click yes. 5. Then wait about 5-10 seconds. 6. Buy Battlefield 4, and then you're done!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible. Do not attempt to buy this at all. Activision needs to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It wont even run and when I figure out HOW to atleats get it to start up I have a black screen. Not like COD was ever my favorite FPS franchise but this is not even funny.

Call of Duty: Ghosts works find when itis inside the game, but it freezes on every cut sceen and has to be shut down with task master. All fixes shown on the internet have been tried and the main exe file has been run in compatability mode in Windows 10. I have had enough! Do not buy this game unless unless you want an exercise in frustration."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was waiting for this for such a long time but after playing the Multiplayer for a while, I'm so disappointed. It's not at all optimized! The menu lags, FPS drops, connectivity issues and what not! I have a very good system and a very good internet connection, still the game lags like hell and connecting to online servers is almost impossible.  COD is one of my favorite franchise but I won't recommend the game to anyone unless Activision patches the problems which I don't see happening anytime soon!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"well, just another CoD... (advise: I've only played single player)  good: - longer than other CoDs (Missions are about 15 to 30 minutes = ca. 7 hours for all. for Modern Warfare 1 it took me about 2 hours to install and 2 hours to play..) - some more open levels, even one to sneak. and driving a tank and flighing a heli is nice.  bad: - story is boring (and unrealistic) - gameplay is boring.... on normal I found myself more often on sightseeing while the other squard members shouted for me but...hey, you can take your time^^...and the rest is just clay pideon shooting. and I'm not that good at shooters! and it doesn't really matters which gun you take.. - combat underwater and in space sucks. - those damn videos while loading the level...always stuttering... - like others said: weird textures - nearly 30 GB Ã´_O  my fazit: nice if bought under 5 bucks....but for 60 it's just a scam.  my walkthrough:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Let's Play [Walkthrough / Playthrough] Call of Duty: Ghosts - Mission 1: Ghost Stories [blind]&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Boring and generic campaign, punctuated by one or two fun set-pieces such as the space battle. Like all CoDs, the standard maps are underwhelming and you have to buy the season pass if you want to pad out your experience. Also, aliens mode is nowhere near as fun as zombies."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I regret paying for this game. First of all, it's a major dissapointment, like every other CODs, second, all the weak â™¥â™¥â™¥ DLC's are over priced and lastly, the game is so poorly optimised it should be criminal selling this game without saying anything bad about it.  Activision has a habit of not caring about pc users but they seem to be getting worse every year ( Selling black ops for 43$? wtf man ) They overcharge for everything, keep their prices so high up they could buy their own country! And the game is barely playable on an average PC ( I can run BF4 no problem with low-mid graphics and Advanced Warfare on Mid graphics ) But not Ghosts.  I love the idea of having customisation in a game, a lot. But 5$ for a skin? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you. People already pay 65$ for the game, almost 60$ for a couple of cheap and small maps...now we should pay a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton more for all those interesting customisation options? This is the reason Activision is dying. Fanboys are keeping them running, only that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is broken and badly optimizied for the PC port. Horrible game with outdated graphics, this game really makes you feel that Infinity Ward hates PC gamers. This game makes me cry."

I have all the specs to run this game. 2nd patch came out, and still they didn't fixed most of communities problems. But they added dynamic fur, yay! And they don't care. Avoid this game from buying on PC. IW don't care about PC community. The game itself is mediocore and ok, but 'optimization' ruins it. Oh, and a cheaters! Remember MW3 on pc? Yeah, same here. Tons of hacked lobbys, boosters(and IW can't do anything about boosters), and cheaters. Save you money and nervs."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but when i go to play multiplayer my GUI is just trashed and my stats are BEYOND fuuuucked up and I randomly get banned!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Boring crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This has got to be one of the worst games I have ever played. It lags, and lags, and guess what, it lags. The over all balistics and and gunplay is so far from being realistic. I mean, even for a COD game its bad. I have been killed by sniper shots that were 10 fet above my head. Yes i know, why over 400hrs? Mostly for the sake of my friends, it was one of the few games we had in common. I regret every hour of it. Hackers are fairly common. The graphics are horrid unless you have it on all ULTRA; even then, its not so pretty. On high it looks like Doom 2. So, save your money, and do'nt make the same mistake I did."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have honestly never had a game run so poorly in my life. Though the game seems as though it would be legitimately good if it ran properly, I have never had a game that was so poorly optimized for PC. The game is boarderline unplayable; it is laggy and prone to the most catastophically terrible FPS drops I've ever seen."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game but when it first came out there was a lot of hacking/cheating. They finally started to police the servers, and the cheating dropped off significantly. HOWEVER, whatever triggers they are using to find such people are too restrictive (or just in error), and last week I was permantly banned (after playing for about 400 hours). To be clear, I do not cheat, have no interest in cheating, and do not have or use things like FOV. One solution is to just buy a new game (i.e., give them more money) and start from scratch. The reason for not doing this is that I have no idea why I was banned and would likely just end up getting banned again. Because of this, I do not recommend this game (at least the multi-player version)."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a review for the multiplayer of Call of Duty: Ghosts, as the game is so poorly optimized I'm not even going to begin to attempt the singleplayer (and we all know we don't play Call of Duty for its story). I am a Call of Duty fan. I have been a fan since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but this game may be the game that stops me from purchasing another Call of Duty. This game's PC version was poorly executed, and if this is the treatment I expect to get with future titles, you can forget it Activision. To start with, I have a fairly nice machine. I can run Skyrim on the highest graphical settings with HD graphical mods with excellent FPS, but I have to run Call of Duty: Ghosts at a medium setting because of how utterly poorly optimized this game is. Graphics are not everything, but they are an important part and in this respect Call of Duty fails. It's 'revolutionary graphics' looks pretty much the same as other titles in the franchise. On to the gameplay (when the game decides to let your machine play), it's not bad. It's a pretty decent ARCADE SHOOTER. This game is not in any way meant to be realistic, and if you come into the franchise on that assumption you are wrong. The upgrading and leveling system is pretty nice, but nothing spectacular. The game hardly improves from it's predecessors. Not the mention, Activision insists on its horrible 'Hardened Editions' or DLC models. This game is just another cash grab, and I feel ashamed that I have given so much money to these people. Do not purchase this title for the PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Backspawns are real
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I was playing this game and suddenly it crashed. Fatal error its said. I am dissapointed. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only good thing about this game is extintion mode...not worth it :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when not let me in say sever unablityfull grrrrrr
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad, Dont buy it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm not really enjoy the campaign of this game though because i think they too focus on multiplayer and which result shall we say Really Bad Ending Campaign
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"words connot describe how crappy this is,i mean really!There are not any! "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Rewards, progression .. huh? this game offers no unlocks no progression it gets very boring I would say its fun for 20 minutes to an hour then verry boring. It has very poor performance it has really bad optimization overall DO NOT BUY"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hello, my name is Akiba, and I've bought CoD: Ghosts.  I know I shouldn't have, and I've vowed to never touch a title of the series again, but I am weak, and look where it got me.  Please, I beg of you, don't make the same mistakes I made. Say no to CoD from the start, don't even touch it once, to maybe, just see for yourself what it's all about, it's not worth it.  Buying CoD is as smart as buying cigarettes, you know it's bad, but you still keep at it. No! Enough is enough, time to quit for good!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even to this day over 5 months after launch this game performs bad i.e. choppy frame rate in multiplayer even in private matches with bots, crashes, massive lag, no anti-cheat and a lame story line in single player. Players complain about this game diverging in design from past COD games but I have played all of the major COD titles exept COD3 (only on console) and the COD Ghosts maps are muliti leveled and large like COD 1 United offensive, a game that had drivable tanks and jeeps, COD 4 (pipeline, overgrown etc.) COD WAW that also had drivable tanks, COD Blops that had rapper IceT voice acting in MP. So COD ghosts is a true COD title and some of the concepts are cool but this game performs bad. The very last COD made for the PC was COD4 modern warfare, I remember IW's Grant Collier talking in interviews on youtube before the COD4 release about how important the mod community was and how the PC version had dedicated servers and was made with PC gamers in mind. But the past is the past and the COD franchise is now a big JOKE to many PC gamers and players of other more 'hardcore' FPS games use the term 'a Call of Duty player' as a insult. I did spend $120. on two copys of this game for myself and a family member believing it was built on a new game engin using new powerful game programming features, sadly we both are very disappointed with this game and I would never recommend this game. The player base on PC MP has dwindled down to less than 2000 players at prime time compared to BF4's(another troubled game) 30,000 players at prime time. Only buy this game if you need to complete your COD collection but otherwise DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Trrrrrrrrrable game.... This might be the end of the COD series, or the beginning of the end at least......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not support the Call of Duty franchise anymore because it has gone down the drain. Especially on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lets get started on this rant, shall we?  So, I've finished the campaign and hit 1st prestige on Multiplayer, and I can safely say that this Call of Duty is an insult to the Franchise and all gamers. Complete and Utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Disgusting Maps, whoever made the maps needs to take happy pill. You die in a second. Slow paced as hell. Isn't optimized for PC at all. Dedicated Servers is a lie.  Also, Not to mention the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DLC that has just been released. 'Wolf Skin' Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing serious, 5$ for a DLC that changes how your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing killstreak looks like? Come on Infinity Ward, money â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  Infinity Ward.. what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ have you done. If you don't have Black ops 2, go buy that instead of this piece of crap game... At least Treyarch tried.  One last thing, you call yourself â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing innovative? Fish AI and a dog that you have in the first missions than is left behind until the end of the game.  YEAH, YOU'RE SO INNOVATIVE. HOW DID YOU KNOW I WANTED FISH AI ALL THIS TIME?  Infinity Ward you are garbage, and your game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Worst of all Call of Duty. It should never had been released to PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is such a failure. End of story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly do have a fun time playing this game, which I do with all Call of Duty's, and is the reason why I buy it every year. But it is unfortunate that a company on the level of Infinity Ward can mess up so much on a PC port of their game, the platform that their foundation is built on. I am somewhat sympathetic for them since they did have to create next gen versions of the game as well, on a two year development time, but I draw the line when they make a PC version that is sometimes almost unplayable, in multiplayer atleast. The single player portion runs great for me, all of my setting can be put at the highest, and the game truely looks good. I really enjoyed the single player, I liked the new characters and the whole concept of this small team of so called Ghosts. The storyline was also a refreshing break from the last 3 Modern Warfare games, which is nice. Unfortunately, multiplayer is a different story. The framerate and stuttering are ridiculous at times, leaving the game virtually unplayable at times, forcing you to lower your settings and possibly even the resolution to smooth out the gameplay experience. It feels like a mediocre company ported the multiplayer, while IW did the single player, they almost feel like to completely different games from a graphical and technical standpoint. This is a shame considering that the engine this game runs on is 10 years old, and they make these high requirements for this game that could easily be run on a decently powered PC. Although I do have fun with the multiplayer, and Extinction mode is all kinds of fun, I would say that you should wait to see if Infinity Ward patches things in the near future, or wait for the price to go down drastically.     -Brandon"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Waste of money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have honestly never had a game run so poorly in my life. Though the game seems as though it would be legitimately good if it ran properly, I have never had a game that was so poorly optimized for PC. The game is boarderline unplayable; it is laggy and prone to the most catastophically terrible FPS drops I've ever seen."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Unless you like the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as black ops 2 this si the game for you with all new â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t including the Invisible dogs, die as soon as you become alive. small - medium maps ( why add snipers????) when nearly every map has a building every 5 meters. they need a massive map like wasteland from MW2 except 2 twices as big. otherwise not worth getting"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good= Some nice graphics and some decent maps. More ADS-orientated gunplay and useful sniping than Black Ops 2 (which was actually a good game).   Bad = Crap unlock system. Most of all - no anti-cheat protection so the game has almost as many hackers as MW3 had in its prime. Developers couldn't be bothered (or weren't allowed to work) with things like anti-cheat, proper dedicated servers (for all games) and important options like field of view, sound and visible ping etc.  Shame- could've been a good game. May have even gotten away with some of the settings restrictions if it actually had some effective anti-cheat, now most games get ruined.  Ah well, it least it means I won't get tempted to buy DLC.  Don't buy it - instead buy something where they've made the effort towards PC gamers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the most unoptimised piece of trash I've played in a while. I have 2 gtx 670s, 16gigs of 1600mhz DDR3 ram, and an i-7 2600k overclocked to 4.5 ghz and this game CHUGS, (it doesn't even look that impressive) yet i can run Battlefield 4 at max settings at a constant 60 fps with 64 people running around. Aside from that you CANNOT change the FOV at all, making a lot of people get motion sickness. I just don't understand why this is so unoptimised, but clearly the devs dont give a s*** because its been out for almost a month and these been no performance optimization. STAY AWAY. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL REGRET IT LIKE ME"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, not as good as I thought it was. I haven't even finished the campaign"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not support the Call of Duty franchise anymore because it has gone down the drain. Especially on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I can't even join my friends. This game is so freaking broken...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont like it . MW3 its the best
Call of Duty: Ghosts,LIXO DE GAME! NÃƒO COMPREM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this crap for the love of God, you want your money saved? Don't do like me. Buy Bf4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game have alot good things to offer,but it have its negative sides too...i like the grey-ish lightning in maps,new weapons and new killstreaks but there are alot of negative sides...Like the game isnt optimized for PC yet and its really laggy and its full of bugs,glitches and there isnt any dedicated servers....overall rating for me is (7.5/10)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,laggy and hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IW really surprised me with this game! They managed to make a game that is even WORSE than MW3. Waste of 60eur DONT BUY!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hackers are not regulated 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There's more cheating on this game than all the rest, great game but wouldn't recommend playing on line, won't be buying any other COD games till they stop the cheating"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Disgusting game filled with hackers. My 1.90 KD being ruined by them and they are not getting banned. Good job.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The rampant cheating that is allowed is sickening! Big waste of money. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Awesome SP but a little expensive if you are only going to buy it for SP. Black Ops II is still the best MP CoD title. Way too much caming in the Ghosts maps for my liking.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay..this game is not bad in single player,but.. FXXK THE MULIT PLAYER! 1.Many hacker in game 2.DLC is so fxxking expensive 3.Map design is not good 4.Camp=Win 5.The game is not cost 60us i guess PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME! "
Call of Duty: Ghosts," Do not buy this game.   This game is not optimized for PC. Also, there only about 1000 people on during peak hours with hackers in just about every game. In addition to this you can not view your ping so you never know if you have a good connection to the host.  If you really want to play this game get a console version; it will have more people, less hackers, and will actually run well. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i cant belive i bought this game its so garbage and a waste of money i would have rather bought darksouls or watch dogs. in conclusion â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CRAP! Leave it alone and stay away, WASTE OF MONEY. Broken, Hacked and no support.  still crap!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Worst of all Call of Duty. It should never had been released to PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The WORST GAME EVER DONT BUY IT !!!!

I have never enjoyed Call of Duty, but this takes the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gold. Stay away- just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stay away! It's not worth it! This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage- 0/10!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Truely another piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ brought to the PC by activison not even giving a single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about their consumers and fanbase and presenting them an unfinished and not optimized product. Random crashes/freezes, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ textures and a lot of other graphics related bugs make this game an offense to the gaming industry. 0/10 would not recommend."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sure, the trailers were great and all. But this is IW 2014 in a nutshell. Horrible gameplay, constant lag, horrible fps rate. For a major CoD fan, this is Activisions biggest flop"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"same as all the other C.O.D series, hopefully COD AW will introduce new things, Hopefully."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THIS GAME SUCKS, THE WORST I HAVE EVER PLAYED. WISH I COULD GET HALF MY MONEY BACK. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE THAT IS A RUN AND GUNNER. ITS A COMPLETE CAMPFEST, WITH CRAP GLITCHES. EVEN THE MENU LAGS UP WHEN YOUR TRYING TO SETUP A CLASS."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros--&gt; squad mode with bots= the bots are actually comptetent and are actually a lot smarter than blops 2 and some other games, i have seen some interesting behavior that they exhibit single player=decent storyline extinction mode= extinction is interesting enough because of trhe jumping aliens... much more of a challenge than shuffling zombies because of that  pro and con--&gt; the maps are somwhat large  cons--&gt; really poorly optimized for pc graphically, i mean i am running a $1600 gaming laptop with high end graphics and lots of ram and its like only on medium settings... MSI GT70 windows 8 Nvidia 770m(its a high end graphics card for laptops) 16 gigs of ram intel i7 cpu  crap support for dealing with hackers and the game has now gone to crap  now i don't recomend this game... get blops 2 or hope advanced warfare is good"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,buggy and poorly optimized re-hash of a god knows how old ADHD shooter. Treyarch is doing better than IW at this point.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy this for PC
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worthless piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Once again shows that no regard is given for the PC community. Blech. Wretched game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the spawns in this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wasted my money on this game don't really play it because it's not up to par compared to the rest.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC version: There are two different development teams working on Call of Duty to allow a release every year. If you liked MW3 you will like the game. It is the same game with minor tweaks. The hacking in this game is tolerated by the developers. They have done nothing to try and stop the cheating. I will never purchase Call of Duty again that was designed by this team.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the worst call of duties ever to exist, they focused on jerking off instead of designing the game, the graphics are terrible as if it was 2009 or eailer, The gameplay stinks and there are less then 7k people on worldwide at a time, YOU WILL waste your money if you buy this game, The game is so laggy with fps that half of the maps are almost un-playable, and the single player had a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ending, They promased thousands of different customizations but theres only a few hundred, And yet again, despite the whole pc and mac playerbase wanting Rentable-dedicated servers, They kept the random â™¥â™¥â™¥ group finder that allows so many hackers to get in and do what-ever they want with aimbot and wallhacks, good job â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing the call of duty series who ever decided that this alpha version of the game was fit to be sold as the real thing.  Don't buy this, I promas you who-ever read this you will hate the game, as for me I'm done with the call of duty series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is the first attempt to bring COD into the next generation. But it is overall a not enjoyable experience. Featuring terrible graphics, optimization for the PC 'no FOV Slider, 90 FPS Frame Cap, Unoptimized engine, and overall confidence in itself. The Campaign is alright, featuring a decent villan and good set pieces, I give it a 3/5. The Multiplayer is unbalanced, unoptimized, features gigantic maps, and a overall lack of dedicated servers. I give it a 2/5. Extinction is fairly fun, offering a decent storyline and fun gameplay. I give it a 4/5. Overall COD Ghosts is not worth 60 or even 50 dollars. I'd recommend buying it for 40 or 30 dollars. Overall it gets a 3/5."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why not tell pc players that you don't want us as clients... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is poorly optimized.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Could of been a better game if they did more to it. For example, in the campaign it crashes at a certain levle"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just bad in general, Animations, fps, constant lag (everywhere). Boring as hell due to being able to unlock any weapon when you get points. Whats the point in ranking up now? So yeah. Find something else to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD ever, it's not even finished"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy this for PC

Call of Duty: Ghosts,worthless piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a gamer, I understand the limitations that many game studios have putting out a good game, especially a good pc port. But, you would think that the developers behind the Classic Modern Warfare experience on PC (Infinity Ward) would have a little more respect for their PC fanbase. As small as the PC COD community is, we do have high expectations, just as our console friends of this yearly series. So, it came as a huge shock when I discovered how limiting the PC Ghosts experience was. The core game is Call of Duty with all of it's usual bells and whistles such as a set-peice filled campaign, class driven multiplayer, and the new co-op extinction mode. To put it as simply as possible, if you came for COD, you get COD, but that's just about it. Also, if you have a beast rig that makes titles like Battlefield 4 glow with realism, expect COD Ghosts to look like a muddy and uninspired mess. With the budget Infinity Ward has, and after boasting about their new game-engine, you will be suprised to see just how last gen this title is. To be honest, this is by no means the worst looking COD title out, but for next-gen, and also being compared to their competition Battlefield 4 you might not want to account visuals as a game changer for your purchasing descision. The online is addictive (and frustrating) like previous titles which alone does make the game worth a whirl, but with horrible clan support, no real compelling or inspired weapon upgrades, and with horrible FPS drops the online will get tedious and make you question why you're not on Battlefield at times. For 60$ game is a no-go in my humble opinion. I'd wait for the bargain bin sale before picking this COD title up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the spawns in this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

And it was.  This is by far and away the worst Call of Duty ever (and I suffered through MW3). Do not buy.   And as a side note, after the first mission, my entire PC crashed and required a reboot.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Maps are too huge, too many places (making enemies attack you in every direction), map sizedoesn't balance with amount of players. Kills are too quick. Loads of over-powered weapons, sniper scoping looks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Graphics are sht and very greyish compared to blops 2(blops 2 had beautiful and colourful graphics), had to run them on lowest possible settings to have fine performance, unlike black ops II which at any settings had great performance. Campaign is â™¥â™¥â™¥ crap, no event that makes you feel emotional, you don't have any choices. Only good thing is that its an FPS and I like dogs, but no overall improvement from the older cod games, it's a backwards movement for me. Black ops 2 by far obliterates cod ghost, wasted $70 This is just my opinion so don't hate."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this crap. I'm an idiot gamer, I play these games so you don't have to."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where do i start... I started up COD Ghosts and decided to play the campaign. The campaign in my opinion was not all that bad it lacked a basic story like most fps games, but it was ridiculously easy at some times. I spent a good eight hours on the campaign so it is pretty normal for the series. So COD Ghosts if you were only to play the campaign i would give it a 6/10. So i finished the campaign and started up multiplayer, this is where everything went down hill. Start it up make a charecter first lobby i join is hacked, so i leave the game and then play another. The texture quality of everything was terrible considering the game has a huge install size. It lags (Its not my components i can play BF4 on ultra at 60fps) and half of the thirty minuets i spent on the multiplayer I was wondering what kind of LSD the programmers were on when they coded it. So in total for multiplayer i rate it a 2/10. So a combined score for ghosts considering most people play the game for multiplayer 3.5/10. I also forgot to mention before the patch that fixed the pc side of the game it was completly unplayable, worst cod ever if anyone is debating this vs BF4 Get BF4."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"[EDIT for new developments]  Another year, another CoD.  I find this one of the 'better' CoD's in terms of customization and visual appeal, but that is heavily overshadowed by its glaring flaws.  (This applies only for the MP portions, not the SP or Extinction)  For one, there is no form of built in anti-cheat, not even VAC, so hackers are more commonplace than they have been in previous iterations on the PC, which quickly makes for a unpleasant experience.  [EDIT: Their is now a anti-cheat, and it does work, to a degree]  Second, the hitreg is at its all-time low, with being shot around corners and bullets disappearing into nothingness commonplace, even at seemingly low pings, which you cannot even tell since the game no longer displays that for you.  Thirdly, the map designs in this game are absolutely terrible, with them ether being too big (Stonehaven), or too small (Strikezone), with only 2-3 maps being a reasonable size for the average 6v6 TDM match.   For the fourth point, gun and equipment balance is out of whack in this iteration, with Assault rifles essentially beating every other weapon type in all situations, even snipers and SMG's, and explosives like IED's (the new Bouncing Betty/Claymore) being nigh impossible to see without a specific perk, which really drags down the experience when you just randomly die due to a IED placed somewhere you cant even see.  For the final nail in the coffin, the game has horrendous performance issues, even on beefy computers. With framerates dropping below 60 even on the smaller levels, it disrupts gameplay quite a bit when your framerate drops in the middle of a gunfight, causing you to die when you should have lived.  + Character Customization +/- Updated engine adds prettiness  - Hitreg - Lack of Anti-cheat [EDIT: Their is a anti-cheat in place, it works to a degree] - Poor map design - Poor weapon and equipment balance - Poor optimization   Overall, If I didnt get this game as a gift, I would not be buying it, but if you got it for free, its a good bout of fun. Just be prepared to scream bloody murder at disappearing bullets."

Developers couldn't be bothered (or weren't allowed to work) with things like anti-cheat, proper dedicated servers (for all games) and important options like field of view, sound and visible ping etc.  Shame- could've been a good game. May have even gotten away with some of the settings restrictions if it actually had some effective anti-cheat, now most games get ruined.  Ah well, it least it means I won't get tempted to buy DLC.  Don't buy it - instead buy something where they've made the effort towards PC gamers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lets get started on this rant, shall we?  So, I've finished the campaign and hit 1st prestige on Multiplayer, and I can safely say that this Call of Duty is an insult to the Franchise and all gamers. Complete and Utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Disgusting Maps, whoever made the maps needs to take happy pill. You die in a second. Slow paced as hell. Isn't optimized for PC at all. Dedicated Servers is a lie.  Also, Not to mention the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DLC that has just been released. 'Wolf Skin' Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing serious, 5$ for a DLC that changes how your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing killstreak looks like? Come on Infinity Ward, money â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  Infinity Ward.. what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ have you done. If you don't have Black ops 2, go buy that instead of this piece of crap game... At least Treyarch tried.  One last thing, you call yourself â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing innovative? Fish AI and a dog that you have in the first missions than is left behind until the end of the game.  YEAH, YOU'RE SO INNOVATIVE. HOW DID YOU KNOW I WANTED FISH AI ALL THIS TIME?  Infinity Ward you are garbage, and your game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the most unoptimised piece of trash I've played in a while. I have 2 gtx 670s, 16gigs of 1600mhz DDR3 ram, and an i-7 2600k overclocked to 4.5 ghz and this game CHUGS, (it doesn't even look that impressive) yet i can run Battlefield 4 at max settings at a constant 60 fps with 64 people running around. Aside from that you CANNOT change the FOV at all, making a lot of people get motion sickness. I just don't understand why this is so unoptimised, but clearly the devs dont give a s*** because its been out for almost a month and these been no performance optimization. STAY AWAY. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL REGRET IT LIKE ME"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not support the Call of Duty franchise anymore because it has gone down the drain. Especially on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Trrrrrrrrrable game.... This might be the end of the COD series, or the beginning of the end at least......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Worst of all Call of Duty. It should never had been released to PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is such a failure. End of story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, not as good as I thought it was. I haven't even finished the campaign"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly do have a fun time playing this game, which I do with all Call of Duty's, and is the reason why I buy it every year. But it is unfortunate that a company on the level of Infinity Ward can mess up so much on a PC port of their game, the platform that their foundation is built on. I am somewhat sympathetic for them since they did have to create next gen versions of the game as well, on a two year development time, but I draw the line when they make a PC version that is sometimes almost unplayable, in multiplayer atleast. The single player portion runs great for me, all of my setting can be put at the highest, and the game truely looks good. I really enjoyed the single player, I liked the new characters and the whole concept of this small team of so called Ghosts. The storyline was also a refreshing break from the last 3 Modern Warfare games, which is nice. Unfortunately, multiplayer is a different story. The framerate and stuttering are ridiculous at times, leaving the game virtually unplayable at times, forcing you to lower your settings and possibly even the resolution to smooth out the gameplay experience. It feels like a mediocre company ported the multiplayer, while IW did the single player, they almost feel like to completely different games from a graphical and technical standpoint. This is a shame considering that the engine this game runs on is 10 years old, and they make these high requirements for this game that could easily be run on a decently powered PC. Although I do have fun with the multiplayer, and Extinction mode is all kinds of fun, I would say that you should wait to see if Infinity Ward patches things in the near future, or wait for the price to go down drastically.     -Brandon"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game had huge potential and was completely wasted. On release it was no better that a late Alpha release with a ton of bugs that haven't been patched in the least. Exploits and hacks are rampant in every lobby you get into with IW not doing anything about it. On the average there are barely 4k players and those numbers are dwindling fast.  Save your money and buy something else.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"same as all the other C.O.D series, hopefully COD AW will introduce new things, Hopefully."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,buggy and poorly optimized re-hash of a god knows how old ADHD shooter. Treyarch is doing better than IW at this point.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its a great game defineltly a good multiplayer, bad think is its poorly ported to PC.. i have a great computer i can even run BF4 on High but this even struggles on Low."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a joke, I'm a long time COD fan and I have to say, how the mighty have fallen. Performance issues abound, confusing gameplay elements, Crashes, the list goes on...   On the plus side, the fish are realistic."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC version: There are two different development teams working on Call of Duty to allow a release every year. If you liked MW3 you will like the game. It is the same game with minor tweaks. The hacking in this game is tolerated by the developers. They have done nothing to try and stop the cheating. I will never purchase Call of Duty again that was designed by this team.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its not too bad like some people say it is, but i would say its very disappointing . Half of the time you cant either connect to the service or you experience a lot of stuttering or fps lag. This game was rushed and the developers just dont care about the game anymore, they just want the money so i would say do not waste your money on this game, its broken and overpriced."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst Call of Duty of the last years. Unoptimised for pc, plenty of bugs, lack of console and really bad gameplay. 3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TBH its the worst of the whole franchise i feel sorry for the actors who were hired to advertise this garbage their name is tarnished.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"same as all the other C.O.D series, hopefully COD AW will introduce new things, Hopefully."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sure, the trailers were great and all. But this is IW 2014 in a nutshell. Horrible gameplay, constant lag, horrible fps rate. For a major CoD fan, this is Activisions biggest flop"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a game that you can play for a decently interesting single player campaign. There are some interesting features that were not featured in the previous CoD games (Reilly, ODIN satellite strike etc) but these are only minor things.   Multiplayer is not even close to being as good as Battlefield 4 (on console, that is).   If you have money and you want to spend it on CoD, why not do a throwback and get back to MW1 and 2?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a gamer, I understand the limitations that many game studios have putting out a good game, especially a good pc port. But, you would think that the developers behind the Classic Modern Warfare experience on PC (Infinity Ward) would have a little more respect for their PC fanbase. As small as the PC COD community is, we do have high expectations, just as our console friends of this yearly series. So, it came as a huge shock when I discovered how limiting the PC Ghosts experience was. The core game is Call of Duty with all of it's usual bells and whistles such as a set-peice filled campaign, class driven multiplayer, and the new co-op extinction mode. To put it as simply as possible, if you came for COD, you get COD, but that's just about it. Also, if you have a beast rig that makes titles like Battlefield 4 glow with realism, expect COD Ghosts to look like a muddy and uninspired mess. With the budget Infinity Ward has, and after boasting about their new game-engine, you will be suprised to see just how last gen this title is. To be honest, this is by no means the worst looking COD title out, but for next-gen, and also being compared to their competition Battlefield 4 you might not want to account visuals as a game changer for your purchasing descision. The online is addictive (and frustrating) like previous titles which alone does make the game worth a whirl, but with horrible clan support, no real compelling or inspired weapon upgrades, and with horrible FPS drops the online will get tedious and make you question why you're not on Battlefield at times. For 60$ game is a no-go in my humble opinion. I'd wait for the bargain bin sale before picking this COD title up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this games is a bad port and should be took off the steam store as its a 50 % chance youll be able to run it. even if your pc is high end.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campaign is okay. But the multiplayer is filled with hackers and lag. This game isnt for the PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,0/10 keeps crashing FOV nauseating
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"lots of frame drops, slow load, freezing, crashes at startup sometimes, gameplay is fun if you havent played cod in a while. but the constant framedrops and lagging is pretty annoying and iw doesnt even admit or comment the problems players have. that they fix a user interface bug instead of the lagging what effect a majority of the game is really really annoying for a fps game. So for know i dont give a good advice about the game FIX THE DAMN LAG! THERE ARE ONLY 3000 DUDES ONLINE FFS! WAKE UP"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"typical cod. nothing really outstanding about this yearly installation. still caters for hackers as it's difficult to report anyone (if it does anything) plus side is it does have a few (!) sniping maps.  if it continues the trend, i won't bother with anymore cod's"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where do i start... I started up COD Ghosts and decided to play the campaign. The campaign in my opinion was not all that bad it lacked a basic story like most fps games, but it was ridiculously easy at some times. I spent a good eight hours on the campaign so it is pretty normal for the series. So COD Ghosts if you were only to play the campaign i would give it a 6/10. So i finished the campaign and started up multiplayer, this is where everything went down hill. Start it up make a charecter first lobby i join is hacked, so i leave the game and then play another. The texture quality of everything was terrible considering the game has a huge install size. It lags (Its not my components i can play BF4 on ultra at 60fps) and half of the thirty minuets i spent on the multiplayer I was wondering what kind of LSD the programmers were on when they coded it. So in total for multiplayer i rate it a 2/10. So a combined score for ghosts considering most people play the game for multiplayer 3.5/10. I also forgot to mention before the patch that fixed the pc side of the game it was completly unplayable, worst cod ever if anyone is debating this vs BF4 Get BF4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"[EDIT for new developments]  Another year, another CoD.  I find this one of the 'better' CoD's in terms of customization and visual appeal, but that is heavily overshadowed by its glaring flaws.  (This applies only for the MP portions, not the SP or Extinction)  For one, there is no form of built in anti-cheat, not even VAC, so hackers are more commonplace than they have been in previous iterations on the PC, which quickly makes for a unpleasant experience.  [EDIT: Their is now a anti-cheat, and it does work, to a degree]  Second, the hitreg is at its all-time low, with being shot around corners and bullets disappearing into nothingness commonplace, even at seemingly low pings, which you cannot even tell since the game no longer displays that for you.  Thirdly, the map designs in this game are absolutely terrible, with them ether being too big (Stonehaven), or too small (Strikezone), with only 2-3 maps being a reasonable size for the average 6v6 TDM match.   For the fourth point, gun and equipment balance is out of whack in this iteration, with Assault rifles essentially beating every other weapon type in all situations, even snipers and SMG's, and explosives like IED's (the new Bouncing Betty/Claymore) being nigh impossible to see without a specific perk, which really drags down the experience when you just randomly die due to a IED placed somewhere you cant even see.  For the final nail in the coffin, the game has horrendous performance issues, even on beefy computers. With framerates dropping below 60 even on the smaller levels, it disrupts gameplay quite a bit when your framerate drops in the middle of a gunfight, causing you to die when you should have lived.  + Character Customization +/- Updated engine adds prettiness  - Hitreg - Lack of Anti-cheat [EDIT: Their is a anti-cheat in place, it works to a degree] - Poor map design - Poor weapon and equipment balance - Poor optimization   Overall, If I didnt get this game as a gift, I would not be buying it, but if you got it for free, its a good bout of fun. Just be prepared to scream bloody murder at disappearing bullets."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wow people are really dissing this game. Not that it's praise-worthy, but still, such bashing.  Well, it's Call of Duty - whaddya expect ? If you've played any title since the first Modern Warfare, you already know what you're getting into. In the end, it's a pretty refined (gameplay-wise) MP experience, and not much else.  On Multiplayer  Still that crappy matchmaking, but some of the larger maps I've seen in CoD's history with smaller teams creates a better experience than tight arenas full of people. I've been spending a lot more time skulking around looking for people, and I'm pretty mobile. Nothing much new with the guns except for more balance than previous titles - you no longer see everyone running the same OP setup.   I liked the new customization system better than BO 2 Pick Ten - you can remove secondaries to have more perks, and you're free to mix and match the perks to your liking, with the potential to create unique classes. Of course that potential is hindered by the fact that it's mostly perks you've seen before, and that a lot of them are pretty useless (Takedown removes the symbol that hangs in the air for the enemy team where you got a kill, which is meaningless in hardcore, Resilience removes fall damage which seems a bit random anyways, with not a lot of high drops ingame ANYWAY, Extra Lethal or Tactical - Scavenger should allow you to replenish grenades. But I digress.)  The maps are pretty boring, I can't say that I really enjoy any of them, while I do hate the verticality and openness of some. But that's probably 'cause I'm a stoner that doesn't think. That ''dynamic map'' map thing, could've been a lot more interesting. One map can be radically transformed, another can be filled with smoke for 30 seconds, one has occasional earthquakes, but other than that ? It's pretty much opening or closing doors. AMAZING !!! Not.  The new lean ability is pretty cool, but seems a bit broken, not engaging when you'd think it would or vice-versa, sometimes exposing you too much automatically. But my mouse is old and abused, the clicks sometimes misfire, so maybe I'm just having more trouble there than most. The slide to crouch while sprinting, is a bit hard to control, sometimes taking you too far or not enough, but it can be useful.  The new kill streak system though, is very balanced, and a lot less lethal then before. Well not really, but most of them do require tactical thinking and skill to use effectively, in the Assault class anyways. I'll say this though - I own an 60 pound husky, and it would definitely not take more than 10 bullets to put him down. The Support stuff is cute but most people will eventually resort to the 3-4 truly useful, like the Support Troop or the Oracle. I used to love Specialist in MW3 FFA, but somehow I don't feel like using it anymore, so I can't really comment on that, other than higher priced perks require more kills, so you'll find yourself using low-tier perks to get to your bonus. Which kinda sucks. It makes the difference between achieving the bonus at 8 kills (with a low-tier perk ladder) or 13-14-15 (with a better perk ladder). Meh  Challenges ! To unlock useless but pretty patchs and titles ! Unlike previous games, now there's only a handful of them active at a time. You may have gotten 1000 kills using the red dot sight, but if the challenge wasn't active, tough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. It is possible to change active challenges by spending 1 squad point (the currency of MP, of which you'll earn a handful per game) but since it's randomized ... It's not great. In my opinion all challenges should be active at all time. This is just an artificial way of lenghtening the unlocking process. Booo !  On Squads  Do you enjoy camping ? Good. The terrible AI constantly swarming you will make sure you can sit in a corner, sights trained on the door, shooting baddies as they come in. Until they start becoming total bullet sponges, needing more than what you have in a magazine to take down. I played a dozen games in different modes, with friends, random, and solo, and haven't been back.   On Singleplayer  Wait. Wait ... waaaaaaaaait ... Ok, go here. Kill (again, terrible AI). Ok, go there. Sit through an incredibly bombastic, over the top action sequence. Go there. Waaaaaaaaaait ... Kill. I might be stoned outta my mind, but this is incredibly boring. I got through the middle of the campaign in about 3 hours and haven't been back. Btw, I've finished EVERY CoD on Veteran except BO 2. And I couldn't finish the campaigne here.  On Extinction  MOOOOOOOO !!! MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!  Zombies worked out great. This is a copy paste but with aliens. Then why is it so freakin boring ? Hives are take forever to destroy (again, artificial lengthening). Enemies are TOTAL bullet sponges especially end-game. Guns are totally boring - you just need high damage output with the less reloading possible, so LMG it is. Maybe AR if you're feeling brave. Upgrading them is a cool idea - but totally luck based. This needs a lot of teamwork - maybe including a chat box in the lobby would help making sure everyone has complementary equipment. You complete challenges to get bonus skill points - but randoms will more often than not completely ignore them or actively fail at them, leaving you underpowered at end game. Speaking of which, there isn't much ways to complete it except deploying automated sentries everywhere and that kind of game mechanic abuse. Oh yeah, reloading - you're ALWAYS reloading. Have a full clip of armor-piercing round and refill your inventory from a dropped box ? RELOAD. ALL YOUR GUNS. You're shooting so much, quasi non stop in fact, that you run out pretty quickly. Better hope the guy with the armor-percing rounds drops some eh ? You get the idea.  Performance  Surprisingly, the game runs flawlessly on my system, and has since day 1.  i7-2670QM GT 555M 8 GB RAM  I do play it windowed (no borders) at 1366x768 instead of my usual 1920x1080, but that's just my mid-to-high gaming laptop from 2011 showing it's age. Still, no downscaling and extra textures, though I do turn the anti-aliasing to a minimum and cut most effects. Which are pretty ugly anyways. Motion blur ? Bloom ? Nvidia special hair ? Please. I enjoy games, and this one runs consistenly at a good FPS, does not crash, and alt-tab's without a hitch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks rhino balls. DO NOT BUY!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the WORST game I have ever played. You die too quickly, guns are too OP, maps are crap and all the DLC that has came out is boring. I would rather play the first Call of Duty than this junk."

The bugs, glitches and poorly performance of this game makes it one of the worst COD Games ever, i serieusly regret it everyday that i spend 38 bucks on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED UP game.   Please DO NOT BUY THIS !!!! IM BEGGING YOU SPEND IT ON ADVANCED WARFARE !!!! PLEASE !!!! :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is getting stupid sometimes i can aim right at a player and miss every freaking shot because of its host lag issues and i cant even play any of those new gamemodes because the only one I get an accual match on is TDM. i want to play like search and rescue and all that other stuff COD used to be a game of running around and just having loads of laughs and fun but know people just camp and camp and camp. you get up in middle of the map you are screwed people constently in windows and corners you cant eve see them. sure this is the players fault but if you think about it isnt they set up all this secret camp areas with perfect line of sight and also considering u die faster on this game than any other cod you basicly die as soon as you get found. this game is clearly made for a concle platform because they are all trying to get the best of Xbox one and ps4 the only game mode that has gottin me in and excited was extinction but then i would lag out of my games so i suggest if you have one just get it on the concele cant belive this game sometimes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible game horrible graphics horrible singleplayer story GREAT AMOUNTS OF LAG

Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst CoD of all of them. It has a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad performance (even on singleplayer) Also it has some serious graphical errors and i can assume that MW3 was alot better. I loved the campaing and was awesome (also coop is good). But if you are going to get this for campaing i recommend you to pirate it sorry. I'm looking foward to buy Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not waste your money on this filth
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS IS THE MOST IDIOT GAME OF ALL TIMES DO NOT BUY IT YOU ONLY GONNA WASTE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(I apologize in advance for spelling and grammar mistakes, english is not my first language)  When it comes to Call of Duty, I kinda lost interest after Modern Warfare 3. Black Ops 2 still held up and I thought to myself that let's see if IW can top Treyarch with the latest CoD. As it turns out, Call of Duty: Ghosts may be the worst purchase I have made this year.  Let's start off with 6-7 hour single player. The story itself is ridiculous. It barely makes any sense and a majority of the characters are bland and completely forgettable. It's usually a bad sign when I actually want most of the good guys to die a horrible painful death. On top of the story and lame characters the game is littered with quick time events, a game concept I absolutely hate if used in the wrong way. I can understand a QTE every now and then and if they're done well. In this game, they slow the game down and it feels like a chore every time one pops up. If we need to jump out of a helicopter to start the stage, the game can do it for us. If we need to rappel up onto a catwalk, I don't want to hold 'F' to do it. It breaks the immersion from the game and you don't feel accomplished when it's done. It's literally 'Push button, you are winner!'. No thought and very boring. And where did the branching storyline from Black Ops 2 go? It may have not been anything new in games, but it was new and interesting in CoD as a series. But nope, IW needs to be as arrogant as possible when it comes to expanding upon things made by Treyarch. IW, you can advertise your single player for having a writer who has won multiple awards writing your game, it's not gonna change the fact that this story is crap, and it's only made worse by the lack of enjoyable gameplay. (And that twist ending... With that scene alone you just made a majority of the CoD: Ghosts campaign null and void and are already sequel baiting for CoD: Ghosts 2)  Multiplayer, on the other hand, is the same as ever, if not a little worse. If you like IW CoD multiplayer before, you'll probably like it now. If you liked Black Ops 2 (I admit, I feel it's on par with CoD4), then you will be disappointed. Most of the new good features that Treyarch implimented into BO2 are nowhere to be seen. I think the only feature that survived was a strange version of the loadout points, except now they determine the amount of perks. There's a few new gamemodes that I find interesting and such. I don't know how many of them are original ideas and how many of them have been done before, but new gamemodes are always fun. But with the game as is, it's the same old CoD on the same old downward slope as the series has been on since MW2 (or what I think at least)... And where's theater mode!?  The only gamemodes left to talk about are Squad mode and Extinction mode. To be honest I hadn't tried Squad mode, but I probably won't either, due to lack of overall interest in the game already. I tried Extinction mode, and to be honest, it's not that bad. As horde modes go, I liked it and it is on par with Treyarchs Zombie mode. However, it's nothing game changing. It doesn't help the game in any way really. I think the only reason they did it is because Treyarchs Zombie mode was popular and Activision just wanted to milk some more money out of another horde mode. Extinction isn't bad, but it doesn't save the game either.  On top of all of these things, the PC port just seems dreadful. Plenty of FPS drops all around, and I've heard that the PC version might be locked at a low framerate. I haven't even really checked for my max FPS, but I've heard others have had a problem like this before. Also, this might be a problem on my end, but I can't seem to get the game to run on my native resolution (1920x1080), which does bug me a lot. It often opens in a borderless window instead of the fullscreen I wanted. IW, do you just hate PC gamers?  Now I'm almost always on the line that graphics don't make a good game, but I think it needs to be mentioned: for a 'Next Gen CoD' the graphics are far from impressive. It still looks pretty much the same as MW2 or MW3. If this is what it's like to step into the next gen of CoD, then please count me out.  Overall, both this game and this port are terrible. The single player is forgettable, the multiplayer is less impressive and the extra modes are not a selling point. I think I used about 50-60â‚¬ on this game when I bought it and I feel that this is the worst thing I have spent it on this year. Just do yourself a favour and don't buy this game. Or if you really feel the need to buy this game, if you absolutely positively have to get this game, then I suppose you could buy it on a console. But honestly, I still wouldn't recommend this game. It's bad."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought this game knowing it sucks for some odd reason i thought it would be beter on PC and i wanted to make my friend jealous of the games my new pc could hamdle the the only resonse i got was you are an idiot. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Game Ever!!!!!!! It the worst cod ever!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is garbage. Don't buy it. Seriously.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really bad game. Never get ever, at all, even as a joke. It's that much of a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not! I repeat, DO NOT buy this. this game has poor PC support, bad performance on stronge hardware, stuttering and fps drops and very very bad netcode. the story is mediocre at most, and was just made as a prepration for ghosts 2. the game has so many cheaters is not even funny. alot of aimboters and wallhacks... And to top that, they deliver emepty promises. they said it will have dedicated server, however it dosent have it. I beg you, please, do not purchase this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Probably the worst COD ever brought out :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is like that one new black girl on the corner who everyone thinks is hot but after after everyone has had her she has spreaded her STD's everywhere
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just an idea... make this game free to play itÂ´s just terrible... itÂ´s actually completely broken... itÂ´s dead DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ITÂ´S LIKE THROWING MONEY INTO FIRE
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, not reccommended... randomly banning people. dont buy this abomination"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, dont understand how I played it so much"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Changing my Review so this game can be nominated and win the ''Golden Potato'' Award !!! Thank you Activision .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a poor excuse for a PC game. I run triple monitors and was BANNED from the game for using a 3rd party program 'FLAWLESS WIDESCREEN' to fix the aspect ratio that the developers should have fixed themselves! The COD franchise only cares about console gamers, and they don't even try to properly optimize their games for PC. You shameful, money hungry, poor excuse for a company!   I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON MY SIXTY DOLLARS! DIRT BAGS!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"At first i thought 'Ah! Another CoD, let's go on a rampage and get my well earned killstreaks' What do i get... a UAV (SatCom in this game) that you put on the ground, also it's as big as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rocket launcher. And the mechanics in this game is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... the leaning was actually really cool but i never saw anyone use it in game... i didn't enjoy playing this game at all...   3/10 would never play agian"
Call of Duty: Ghosts," Unbelievebly bad.   I'm not one to expect groundbreaking new features in Call of Duty, in fact... I would have been happy if this was just BO2 with different guns and maps. But it's a step backward in every area.   Graphics are poor.  They are a step back from BO2 for sure. Graphics wise, it's comparable to MW3 or MW2. Textures are low-res, models uninspiring, and maps unimpressive.   Performance is worse.  Usually with games, you have a choice. The game can look great, but run poorly on most hardware... like BF4. Or it can look bad, but run great like State of Decay. But with Ghosts, on the otherhand, you get a game that looks bad and plays terrible. Turning everything down, I could finally muster out 70-80fps... but zoom in with any scope, and I'm down in the 30s. I can run Battlefield 4 on higher settings and get more frames.   Lacking basic features.  Want to change your VOIP volume? Nope. Want to see your ping? You don't even get connection bars in Ghosts. Theater mode, no can do.  There's really nothing here for even the most diehard CoD fans. People have complained about CoD being a bad console port for some time now, but this is the first one where actually I agree with them."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game..........no use preordering call of duty now....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,needs dedicated servers!!!! DO NOT BUY FOR PC!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pathetic Pc Port anad generally bad game. I wil admit the console version is not that bad but this is another story. System requirments are outrageuos, its ugly, horrible framerat, max 80 FOV. don't even think about it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not that good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,- Frame drops - Not optimised for PC - Huge maps = Slow pace = Not COD  Good stuff --&gt; - Hit detection - Character movement - Camera angle!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Diffenately one of the worst CoD games to date... It is a big change, but they changed the really big things which does not make this game as fun as pass CoD's. There are only like 4 or 5 maps that are fun and the rest are WAY to big. Not to mention Extinction is a pretty big bust.. I do not reccomend this game unless you wanted a change from past CoD's."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts comes out as the weakest installment to the series. If you were hoping to get a new Call of Duty drug fix for the year, Call of Duty Ghosts isn't gonna do it for you. On max settings there are some spots here and there where you will see some beautiful hi res textures. Unfortunately, that's only on some cases. Most of the times this 'next-gen' game pulls out muddy textures lathered in feces throwing it at your face like it's all that. In the campaign, the levels play out as highly choreographed cutscenes of some of the most common hollywood action movie cutscenes. They can be really cool at times, but have no lasting power and end way too fast (really short levels). The campaign for any experienced fps player will take less than 6 hours to beat, considering that some time is placed on setting up the game first. You'll forget about the campaign the moment you beat it, because it took so little time with uninspired levels.  By now this game is notorious for being a poorly implemented console port thrown together by a small team of rotting zombie brains. Some people simply can't start the game; most have constant stuttering issues. Those with SLI/Crossfire have graphical distortion, flickering, and major stuttering, which also occurs for single graphics card users. Random fps drops occur for many people. The game also has a memory leak where if it doesn't load in another level after a certain amount of time, it'll crash. Of course that is after a very long time (several hours) before it decides to go hay-wire. Character models have puddy ugly faces and an ominous glow around them for some nonapparent reason. A developer choice to make it easier to spot players?   Everyone on the forums seems to have the mindset that the game doesn't run as well as it should, being a call of duty game. People with monster rigs of a Titan or even SLI Titans get stuttering and random fps drops too. Graphical anomoles are present in many places in the campaign, especially the jungle escape level with the river and water causing a massive blue glow pixallation all over the screen making it hard to see anything. After a certain amount of time playing in the campaign (again a couple of hours), the game will fail to load textures causing everything to be black with grey flickering geometry. It's like the characters are in the dark. It takes a restart of the game to fix it, implying that the game isn't utilizing resources correctly.   Multiplayer is severely underpopulated making it hard to get a game of for instance search and destroy/rescue. That makes it uneasy on the mind on how long this game may last on pc. Some modes such as Capture the Flag failed to make an appearance this time around for no apparent reason at all. Field of View is locked at 60-65 just like MW3 and there is no official word on if it'll change or if using the FoV unlocker is allowed. Frames per Second is locked at 91 fps again with no word on whether IW/Activision will change it or allow for the FPS unlocker. If you have a fancy 120hz or 144hz monitor, there's little use for it in this game. Nearly every gun in the game takes 3 bullets to kill someone giving no differences between one gun to another causing the guns to have little 'personality' to them. They don't really stick out to me. Couple the fact that it only takes about 3 bullets to kill and the massive lag that everyone experiences, you most often die instantly upon seeing another player, because that player saw you a second or two ago and already shot and killed you before the game even shows it to you. The lag is preposterous happening in all games to varying degrees of extreme to minor and unfortunately mostly moderate to extreme. Multiplayer literally has no anticheat program in it. The only thing that can barely be considered an anticheat is the submit a player as cheating button, which is like Treyarch's player submission except your submission goes into a pile of crap to be burned as there seems to be no one at the other end that cares to review them. There is no VAC protection, because of IW/Activision's choice to turn the game into 64bit.exe. VAC works only with 32bit. So, there is essentially no anti-cheat. Cheaters publically mock players over their defenselessness doing whatever they please. Cheaters are in every other lobby and sometimes in groups or clans together. Literal actual cheaters using blatant wallhacks and super aimbots among several other cheats like lobby manipulation, not just a suspicion of a good player in-game. All the 'next-gen' Dx11 features seem to be poorly implemented and combined with the transition to turning the game into 64bit is probably a lot of the reason for all the performance problems of the game. Also, the game required at least 6 gigs of RAM despite really only using around 2 gigs and used to lock people from launching the game that had &lt;6gigs of RAM. The game requires over 40 gigs of HD space despite having such little content and many bland textures making you wonder why the hell the game requires so much damn space, like giving a basket ball stadium to a damn mouse.  The gun sounds are thankfully nice and powerful sounding. The multiplayer maps however are very boring. They're too large for a small 6 vs 6 game causing a lot of just wandering around with your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in your hand before you stumble upon another player wandering around with their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in their hand. IW/Activision also didn't take into account that they should've added a lot more stuff into the very large maps causing a lot of the maps to have large barren areas of nothing. leading players to constantly follow the edges of the map. The 'destructable' environment is really not destructible with only a few or single pre-defined set piece(s) being allowed to fall down in a pre-defined animated way the same way each and every single time. There are no dedicated servers, which IW/Activision lied so damn hard about. So, every match you join is a peer to peer match with a person from Uganda. The game doesn't match players closely together. So, you're always matched with someone half way around the world. Considering that there are so few players in this CoD on PC, it's no surprise. So, super lag for everyone! Patches role out like snails and for most do nothing, for some do very little improvements, and others actually makes it worse.  This game was a disappointment, and the only fun I have now is from playing squads with bots as multiplayer is infested with horrendous lag and cheaters. I recommend those who haven't bought the game to save their money for Treyarch's rendition of Call of Duty as they place some effort into catering to PC players.  Almost forgot, my hardware:  i7 3770k oc 4.2ghz GTX 680 FTW 4GB  1866Mhz 8GB RAM 144Hz Monitor"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love  CoD  but this one is  S**T  so if you want a  Good Game  go to  BattleField  or if you want a  CoD Game  go on  Black Ops 2  it have better  Graphics  and much more to  Offer  and have more  Players Online   For my opinion not worth it I got from  CJS CdKeys  on a sale for 16Euros now I know why it was so cheap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,we have 200 active members in 1 para clan 165 play bf4 72 play cod gost why no dedy servers and we no lots of clans ar the same and mor ar going to bf4 all the time. remember it was the pc gamers that made yous grate if it wasent for us yous wood be just anuthe games cupany. we no yous prefer dooing it for the cidy boxes but just remember hoo pays for them and the games. all we ar asking geat the dedy servers up and runing and with controls so we can police ower servers i just dont understand why yous dont do it. yours sincerly 1PARA-JIMMYDUNIT-CO
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really cant give a good reason to buy the game... i put a few hours into it and the ability to tune the game per hardware is sadly lacking [in game lobby music] -the video lags and stutters -the net through put is crap due to match making -the lack of dedicated servers   -the ability to to have dependable ping or predictable lag  -the ability to police the accused vs accusers [manualy issue penalty bans/perm bans] -lack of ingame recording  -lack of third party recording support [fraps etc...due to overlay interferance] -lack of customer service and company feedback on issues -oh and where did my former statistics go for previous COD titles [cant get the custom skins or cards or is that only for consoles?]  I played it and the clan i was in was first in clan wars...however it is not actually cross platform it is only through the phone app that tracks your clan progress vs others console or pc not actual video game warfare interaction...  it is sad to note that this game engine was programmed in linux and for linux and pc... but we are told it is too dificult to program for linux... valve does ok with counter strike same game engine beginings...  I find if i need to get my blood pressure up and hateraid flowing the game is a great start  fury is generated by faulty function and rampant cheaters and all around shenanigans  Singleplayer campaign is rich with eyecandy and effects but i want to play multi player...backfit the cod4 engine to this and it will be good again otherwise... pfft battlefield 4 or mobinogi is your best bet the only way I see infinityward activision making this right...they wont give money back fine...make a large non-deductable donation to the shriners/mayo clinic/or something of that calibre that way i will feel my money will have gone to a good cause afterall.  oh and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you activision nice map pack release and no hack stoppage shove it up you a s s sideways and twist it!  I correct myself infinity ward did correct it the formed respawn and made Titanfall
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont buy this better give the money to a homeless guy or an african kid.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"flat out 3/10 game but the dog doesn't die so I'll give it an extra 3 for a total of 6/10 No actual ghosts though, so 5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Call of Duty that ended it all for me. This installment is the biggest pile of trash I have ever played and the community died within a month of release. They still havent even fixed many of the problems that make this game unplayable.  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!  Spend your money on a game thats worthy of your hard earned cash. Support devs and games that deserve to be supported. Not these recycled copy and paste games they keep spitting out year after year making it more and more of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ child of what it once was.  Unless your favourite food is Doritos and you only drink Mountain Dew stay away from this game and any installment after it. Call of Duty is dead.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I strongly recommend NOT to get this game, on PC anyway. One of the worst ports I have seen to PC. Runs like turd, looks like turd, and plays like turd. This game is turd. Save some money and get black ops 2 instead if you don't already."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghosts is a cookie cutter game with a little touch of alien frosting on top.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The lack of dedicated servers and rampant cheating (hacks) makes this game a total piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Come on Activision and related parties, get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together. I would not waste your time or money on this game."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is under developed, many bugs and crashes  Runs an unknown type of format which cost me 129$ to get it to work, and when it did work it failed and stuttered horribly, many frame rate drops  I highly dont suggest COD: ghosts, wait for GTA V for PC to be released."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The newest game in the Call of Duty franchise was kinda disappointing. While the singleplayer does have some good/entertaining moments , it is filled with annoying sequences , bad AI and graphics. That's not everything , let's talk about the multiplayer : it's bad. Very very bad. Not only is it filled with just stupid maps spots/game mechanics , but the community is even worse. This is an usual lobby : 3-4 non-campers and the rest as you'd expect , campers. Overall opinion : don't buy this game until it gets fixed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unplay able on the pc 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is all about Lagging, Stuttering, and Camping while using Themal Scope. There's also a dog whose more powerful than a human."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Cod ever! Strait copy paste from MW2 and MW3 Even on the Campaign Mode. Frame Drops all the way basically leaving the game unplayable. You can't eve see how much ping you have in game how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is that....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm shocked that this game didn't win any awards, such as; worst game of the decade, or best first person shooter to give you cancer. I wouldn't suggest this game if it was free."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If they bother to fix the framerate i will play it but for now WORST GAME EVER!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is so bad and the story is so random i wanna pull my balls off.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game and all the dlc with it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single-player and the extinction mode are great and nevertheless they are good the multiplayer is too buggy and laggy, therefore i decided not to recommend on it because most of the pepole today buy games for their multiplayer else you can just downloaded the cracked version if you are looking for single-player."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The guns in this game provide entertaining gameplay, the equipment and perk selection systems are entertaining and allow great customization... if you're willing to stray from the almost required setup. Hackers are already roaming rampant within the game and the low community pool of average 10k gamers on when I play to the lows of 4k gamers mean it's hard to find games and its hard to dodge hackers. I love playing the game and I'd recommend it if it weren't from the lack of support I fear we will get and the fact I think stopping hackers will never happen in this game. IW/Sledgehammer seem to not understand how hard it is to play a game when you don't give us dedicated servers as a primary option, not something hushed into the background like MW3, had the MW3 servers been able to exp up in, I think they would have been top dog over matchmaking."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"MP- You are always getting shot in the back (bad spawn points), the maps are too big for 6v6, laggs a lot (but you can get use to it), and you die WAY too easy. It feels like you are playing Hardcore mode all the time and for some reason, the dogs in MP take more hits than people. Either the guns are overpowered or you dont not get enough health. Campers are a HUGE problem in this game. The new silde thing in this game is pretty cool though. Also, I have heard there are a lot of hackers and I have run into about 3 since ive been playing. Moving on to creating a class: It's annoying. You have to hog 'squad points' and it gets boring sometimes. Lastly, still waiting for dedicated servers and hopefully rentable, dedicated servers.  SP- There still is a little lag here, but I really enjoyed the story. Really keeps you on the edge and makes you want to keep playing.  Bottom line: This game is not bad, but it is far from the best. Many updates and patches are needed.The main problem for me is again, dieing too easy. I remember in other cod games if someone has shooting you from behind, you could sometimes jump, spin around and maybe have a chance to kill them, but not in this game. I do not recommend it as of today (12-12-13)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really wish there was a way to refund games here.  2/5
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You could feed a village in Africa with the amount of $2 DLC they have.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game and only waste of money last cod game I will buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"don't bother, same ol', same ol'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Needs optimising...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game has terrible performance and a unbalanced Multiplayer. Hackers are on the Servers since the First day and have no innovation. Im dissapointed from infinity Ward. CoD is dead for me and this game is a Joke in contrast to Battlefield 4.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have played and liked EVERY single CoD game since MW2 but this.... this is a waste of 60 bucks.  Not only did they not take anytime at all to optimize this for PC but the engine is horrible and probably one of the worst when it comes to being realistic.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same issue of vram with Sapphire Crossfire 6870's at 1 gb. Turn everything to low or off runs worse than normal, how? I do not recommend this game until they update. All of my friends are having the same issue with newer cards both Nvidia or ATI."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game and only waste of money last cod game I will buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Buy the game they said it will be fun they said
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, dont understand how I played it so much"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Changing my Review so this game can be nominated and win the ''Golden Potato'' Award !!! Thank you Activision .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great offline, Mind blowing graphics and detail, with a not to shabby storieline. Online good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in luck straight garbage. Online 9/10 Offline 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i think this is a terrible game just like all of the out call of duty game if you are stupid enough to buy it u have just wasted Â£40 and you are probely saying well 'hahah well you bought it noob' yes iv bought it so non of you have to go through the same pain i went through END OF NEXT GAME
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a poor excuse for a PC game. I run triple monitors and was BANNED from the game for using a 3rd party program 'FLAWLESS WIDESCREEN' to fix the aspect ratio that the developers should have fixed themselves! The COD franchise only cares about console gamers, and they don't even try to properly optimize their games for PC. You shameful, money hungry, poor excuse for a company!   I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON MY SIXTY DOLLARS! DIRT BAGS!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts," Unbelievebly bad.   I'm not one to expect groundbreaking new features in Call of Duty, in fact... I would have been happy if this was just BO2 with different guns and maps. But it's a step backward in every area.   Graphics are poor.  They are a step back from BO2 for sure. Graphics wise, it's comparable to MW3 or MW2. Textures are low-res, models uninspiring, and maps unimpressive.   Performance is worse.  Usually with games, you have a choice. The game can look great, but run poorly on most hardware... like BF4. Or it can look bad, but run great like State of Decay. But with Ghosts, on the otherhand, you get a game that looks bad and plays terrible. Turning everything down, I could finally muster out 70-80fps... but zoom in with any scope, and I'm down in the 30s. I can run Battlefield 4 on higher settings and get more frames.   Lacking basic features.  Want to change your VOIP volume? Nope. Want to see your ping? You don't even get connection bars in Ghosts. Theater mode, no can do.  There's really nothing here for even the most diehard CoD fans. People have complained about CoD being a bad console port for some time now, but this is the first one where actually I agree with them."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Poorly optimized for PC
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have really enjoyed Call of Duty since 3 came out (played 2 after I played 3 and enjoyed it too), with the exception of World at War and now Ghosts. So I am not going to come out and say that it's the same game every year, as if that is even true. Different guns, different killstreaks, different maps, I'd even go as far to say a whole different playstyle needs to be adapted. It changes enough year to year. That being said, this game is a huge letdown. The campaign was probably the biggest leap they made, which is sad because as everyone knows, CoD is a multiplayer game first. They introduced new campaign elements that atleast kept me entertained for the 5 hours it takes to get through. By no means is it a stellar story, but it is an improvement over previous Call of Duty campaigns.  Multiplayer is unplayable. Literally. You cannot find a game on PC. I've played this on Xbox 360 and PS4 and find matches pretty easily but it appears that the PC audience is absent from this installment. If you are looking for a fun FPS to play on Steam with your friends, I would advise you to look elsewhere. There are a total of maybe 1,000 players online during peak hours, and of those players more than half play Team Deathmatch. If you want any variety of gameplay like an objective, you can go to hell. Aside from all of that, the class customization is over the top. In CoD4 (arguably the best of the series), you get a Primary, a Secondary, 3 perks, a lethal and tactical grenade, and that was it. Short and sweet. In Ghosts, Jesus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Christ. A primary, a seconday, two attachment slots for each, camo for each, lethals, tacticals, 17 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ons of perks, 90 different killstreaks to choose from. What's next, can I choose the camo on my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing frag grenades? It's overwhelming, it's not fun. I feel like to compete in this game you have to sit and heavily think about your loadout and it is supposed to be a casual shooter game. They took the appeal of the simplistic shooter style of CoD4 and said â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it, you wanted a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as a snack? Here's a 5-course meal prepared by the Emperor's gourmet. It's overkill.  Squads mode isn't even worth touching. Why the hell is this in the game? Just do a Basic Training mode like Black Ops and be done with it. I don't wanna pit this pathetic AI system against itself. I guess I can't bash it too much since that is what I had to play most of the time, since I cannot find a damn multiplayer match to jump into.  Extinction. We get it, you want to re-create a fun game mode like Nazi Zombies. Try again, I guess. I can't hate on them for trying to do something new and fun like this but it was poorly executed. Maybe it's different now, I only played the first 'episode' of it on the PS4.   Activision, get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together. Stop dishing out money on stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing live action advertisements with big name actors, start using the money to make more quality games. You do not need ads, you already have a succesful franchise, people will play it and YouTubers will promote it for you given that it is a quality game.  I would give Ghosts a 3/10 and hope for Advanced Warfare to revive this series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Only the storyline and gameplay made me buy this To me it's the best so far. but multiplayer is  a hell of problems just as everyone else said kinda makes me mad i paid money for this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well what can i say, only buy this game if you have over 100 download or you will get destoyed amen"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's horrible. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ an explanation there are enough under me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In my honest opinion as a longterm CoD player and fan this game is very good when it comes to content, only downside for myself is the amount of bugs and issues there are and how long it is taking to get fixed. Its asif they don't give a crap about their game.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I only play CoD games single player, and this one is not worth it. More than any other game in the series so far, Ghosts robs you of choice and agency so many times. This is less of a combat game and more of a movie than any other CoD. If you love CoD 1, 2, and 4, avoid this one. It's a beautiful game with no substance at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Choppy even on low graphics with a good comp. unresponsive commands just a rehash of every other cod ...terrbile game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,5$ for this game .... One of the worst decisions I made.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,About as enjoyable as a colonoscopy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IM CHIESSE AND THIS GAME OFFENDS ME..... I WANT MY 60 BUCKS BACK
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not that great of a game actually! The multiplayer sucks!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably the worst CoD since CoD3 and Modern Warfare 3. What a pile of unoptimized crap. I cannot believe how bad this game runs, there are so many problems and its mess all over the place. As for the multiplayer, the maps are so boring and uninspired, it basically killed my interest to keep playing it. Also, this is IWnet fiasco all over again. Server crash, laggy hosts, half empty servers and the worst thing is that they removed the ping bars/numbers so you are completely clueless about the latency in this game.  The storyline was quite meh, not even close to MW and or even Black Ops series. Now that i finished it, this will return to ''Not Installed'' games and i'll go back to Black Ops 2 MP.  And to think i was insanely hyped about this. What a disappointment.  Score: 5/10 Verdict: Do not waste your hard earned money in this trash. Avoid at all cost.  Buh Bye."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Way too fast paced, horrible gun balance, and terebly boring, hard to follow storyline."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game made my build a whole new pc just to play. infinityward should stop making games.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I tried to give it a chance over 23 hours now but it's terrible. Please don't give them any more money. I wish i could get a refund for this crap.  12/9/2013 update  They have had a few patches and the game is slightly more playable now. Still no where near the level of MW3 though.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,NOOO. Every year... same thing... If you are a normal persone you will stay away from it ! TO TOKSIC ! Whit friend it will be fun for a bit. It requiers to good pc for this bad game ! I better stick with epic BATTLEFIELD !!!  Going to go play some skyrim and BATTLEFIELD. My head hurts after CALL of DUTY Ghosts because it is to bad !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,90% off? :O Still expensive... :I
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ä± cant play multiplayer its showing error.battlefield better than ghosts 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Short campaign(5h), narrow FOV (65 degrees), HORRIBLE mouse acceleration that cannot be fixed, insane ammount of DLC. Confusing multiplayer, filled to the brim with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you have to buy to unlock. The game isn't even worth the 10â‚¬ I payed for it. Possibly the last Call of Duty game I'll ever buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Complete copy/paste experience from all other Infinity Ward cod titles. Pc port got the short end of the stick and is quite ill optimized with rubbish graphic options making minecraft with shaders a better next gen title. 1/10 because the dog was cool.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible PC port. Game constantly crashes, lags, and requires a lot of memory, space, and RAM. No wonder CoD is dominant on consoles. Don't buy. I couldn't even enter the campaign or extinction without crashing. The game couldn't even handle anything over 800x800 resolution without crashing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do NOT buy this game, especially if you have Nvidia. Hell, it's even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on AMD. Texture glitches on AMD. Crashing on Nvidia. Friend of mine has Nvidia, crashes almost every map. Me, on the other hand, texture glitches out the â™¥â™¥â™¥. Absolutely horrible. (This is all multiplayer btw). I mean honestly, how do you screw up CoD? You shoot people with guns. How the hell do you screw that up. This is not worth 60$. This isn't even worth the 40gb download on a free â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weekend. This is worth 5$ TOPS.. IF THAT! The only thing it's got going for it is extinction, except it's only 1 map. And probably 15$ for another map in DLC. Don't buy this game, save yourself the money. Omg, it's the biggest failure in gaming i've ever seen. IW died after MW2 cuz Activision is full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But, to clarify, DO-NOT-BUY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Was a fun game, as are most COD Variants.. BUT  Perma Banned for owning an Ultra Wide monitor that COD devs wont step up and support.

The windows operating system i Paid for, that i am entitled to alter as i see fit.  Game and all DLC taken without warning - all because of a monitor resolution.  Hackers and exploiters get treated with more respect than i have. Never again shall you see a cent from me!  Should be an interesting branch of Activision to watch devolve further, when VR tech takes off in 2016. When so called security teams are still perma banning their long time loyal fans. Killing off your own franchise. Way to go!  This kind of customer treatment unfair, unjust and the true definition of corruption.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PRO'S: - Better animations and moves (climb obstacles, etc) - Clan management intruduction (Clan wars, etc) - Dynamic maps introduction - Soldier system introduction (10 soldiers with 10 prestige each) + soldier customization system  CON'S: - Not optimized for pc (Menu lags, fake fps, etc) - Same graphic enginer as Modern Warfare 2 (outdated) - Unbalanced weapons and minimum health - Classic/Annoying news (new killstreaks, new weapons, etc) - Poor soldier customization system - Not inviting DLC's - Too high hardware requirements"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,i used to enjoy life
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible game. Forgettable story, laggy multiplayer. Wish I could get a refund. This will be the last time I buy a CoD game. The series has gone down hill so much from MW2. Nothing really new in this game, the graphics aren't even 'next-gen', unless you're on console I suppose. I would be ashamed of myself for working on this game. I would tell people I was a walmart employee before I admitted to working on this project. Very sad."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game just does not suit my call of duty fulfillment. It's a huge step backwards from what Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 had offered for PC. We revert back to hosting by others which is horrible when it comes to someone who lives on the other side of the world. Having dedicated servers would have been more beneficial. The singleplayer campaign is decent, but not as interesting as the others. The multiplayer lags alot even if you have gaming rig. If you want to purchase this game just to have another call of duty, be my guest. Aposed to everything else, don't purchase it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible PC port. Game constantly crashes, lags, and requires a lot of memory, space, and RAM. No wonder CoD is dominant on consoles. Don't buy.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Avoid this game if you can.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is horrible i cant even run image quality on normal and i meet the min requirment save ur money and dont get this game. It has stutter in the menu screen and fps dont get me started. WORST GAME EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible spawns, childish community and poorly optimized PC version. The campaign has it's moments but the plot and characters are too superficial. Exctinction is boring, with no real objective or challenge, and multiplayer maps are way too big for 6x6 combats. Most of the time, you'll be running around trying to find someone til you get stabbed in the back.  On the other hand, the sound is greatly designed and shooting feels way better than in the previous two games. Objective modes are cool, but almost no one play them. If you're able to get it by Family Sharing, do it because Ghosts isn't worth of your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lol, so glad i only payed $12 for it XD   Life lesson to you all: Never preorder call of duty XD"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,constantly crashing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'Ghosts' should've alluded to the series greatest moments in Modern Warfare 2, but instead the name stands as a cenotaph to a once great franchise, and a once great studio. While Treyarch steadily improves on CoD, Infinity Ward are working to bury it. Suffice it to say, this is the ghost of CoD past."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"[MP]Performance is (still) dreadful, no FOV-slider, Core is basically Hardcore (No chance to react when being shot in most cases) Pretty big maps for a Call of Duty which isn't necessarily a good thing.   [SP]Basically the same as every year. Generic FPS Kill the bad guys Campaign. 4 Hours of playtime.  Can't recommend this at a price of more than 15-20$ which is probably never going to happen."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought it for 7â‚¬ in my local store, still too expensive for this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst Call of Duty ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Feels unambitious and gimmicky as the Call of Duty franchise struggles to stay hip and creative.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Eww.... eww eww eww... just eww. Ok Extinction is enjoyable but the rest is just eww.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seriously like what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they were thinking?  This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game was waste of 60 eur.  They never fixed the lag and everything.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Camping Simulator 2013. Worst CoD ever, you can't see enemies and EVERY SINGLE killstreak is made to push you into camping.  1/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"0,1 Hours Clocking? You can't write a review. Well i can. Simply because i couldn't even play this game more than 0,1 Hour. Why you may ask ?  well Performence Problems on PC's that Play Battlefield easily on Ultra. Lags. Stutter. All that stuff that isn't fixed after 2 Patches and almost 1 Moth after release.   So yeah i enjoy the game NOT"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Disclaimer: this review covers the single-player only.  In an alternate timeline the U.S. are locked in a difficult conflict against the Federation: as Logan Walker you'll be participating in various missions across the globe to try and turn the war around. While the campaign is quite lengthy and the levels are very different from each other Ghosts suffers from a boring story, dull characters and gameplay that, while fun in short bursts, feels very derivative.   PROS:   -the overall graphics are quite good  -nice soundtrack  -voice actors do a good job  -good variety in levels   -the whole game has a true cinematic feel to it  -good length for an FPS at around 7hrs   CONS:   -some bad textures  -gameplay is very simple and repetitive: it's basically move forward/shoot bad guys with a few cutscenes thrown in  -insipid vehicles sections let down by awkward controls and unrealistic movement  -gunplay is very simple and there's not much difference between weapons  -Generally poor AI for enemies and allies  -forgettable story  -paper thin characters lack any kind of emotional connection  -still has some assorted bugs (e.g. fell through the level once, had to fiddle with graphics settings on last mission due to a glitch making white squares appearing onscreen if water quality was on high)         Call of Duty: Ghosts&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Never will buy CODs anymore after this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I spend â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 110 euros for this. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Dont buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. There is some reason here. -_- - framelag - crashes 24/7 - poor gameplay - they removed capture the flag and battleground - graphics sucks - devs only care about money not the community. Well I know one game what is better than this. Its Battlefield 4. Why ? They care about community and the game not the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money  Dont buy Call of duty ghosts It suck â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing balls. I am sorry for swearing but I am â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off Hope this gets kicked out of steam.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful PC Port, I made it half-way through the game on the lowest settings with a pair of Sapphire 5870â€™s while only crashing a few times. Once I made it to the underwater level the game would crash to desktop with a DirectX error at the exact same point every time right before the mission ended.   Then I bought a Sapphire R9 290X (4 GB card) and tried to play the level againâ€¦guess what happenedâ€¦..I made it 15 seconds farther without crashing!!!!!! How great is that!  No excuse to not be able to run ANY game on a 4GB card on the LOWEST settings. Donâ€™t buy the game, because it literally doesnâ€™t work.   My full specs:  I7 930 @3.4MHz  ASUS Rampage III Extreme  12GB Corsair Dominator GT DDR3 @1888  Sapphire R9 290X  Intel 120GB SSD  2X WD 1TB CB  Corsair HX1200"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you REALLY want to play a call of duty go buy black ops 2. Ghosts i found wasnt very enjoyable.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The worst game ever ,  dont buy  i even dont know what i was thinking when i bought this *-**-*-*"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thought it would be alright for $15. What a rip. Super buggy - what FPS have you played where scopes actually glitch and become useless? Hit detection and lag issues are many times worse than the initial problems plaguing BF4 when it launched. Those are just the most glaring issues.  Graphically, it's rather disgusting. I assumed that everything had defaulted to Low settings for some reason, but upon inspection, it was all set to High. It basically looks like Duke Nukem Forever and plays like Quake 3 Arena.  The whole game is generally a mess; it's split up into three different parts: Single Player, Competitive Multiplayer, and Co-Op Extinction. It doesn't even feel like one unified product which is very strange.  Single player features the typical Call Of Duty style large set pieces void of any interactivity and instead of letting you explore these environments, you are hurried to the next whatever to shoot more stuff. In some cases if you hang back to explore, you automatically fail the mission. Even the objectives you are pushed around to are unclear and not interesting except for bringing you closer to the next loading screen cutscene and towards the end of the game. I played for a few hours and decided it was just too dumb to waste my time with.  Multiplayer is pretty much Team Deathmatch since the majority of players (less than 400) were playing this. Due to the lack of dedicated servers, you have no control over what game you are entering. This sucks so hard. The time to kill for pretty much every weapon is super fast and due to lag, things can get really weird. Dying after running behind a wall, or getting killed before even hearing the multiple shots that took you out. It's gross. Watching the deathcam replays even shows in slow motion how janky the hit detection is - it is pretty damn funny.  Extinction has crashed every time I tried to play it, so maybe I'm missing out on why this game deserves more than $5?    If you are into early-access alpha versions of games, you might like this. Otherwise, save your cash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the worst games i have very played this game is absolute crap!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst COD out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've found probably about 50 glitches in the last few days, a very glitchy game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think that you should not buy this game it is a wast of $60 I got it on sale for $12. I say this because the story is good but it doese not makeup for the amount of crashes consantly I can not belive that this company expects peaople to pay $60 on a game that constantly crashes. The game isint all that bad but the crashes gets realy anoying. You can chrash mid game and lose all the XP its realy anoying. Oh yea did I metion that the game is 40 GB of storage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always been a fan of call of duty, even among a group of friends that hate the franchise. For some reason I can't stop buying. Well, now maybe I can. Not only are this game's graphics, gameplay, gunplay, and lighting completely dissfuntional, but the game just isn't interesting in any way. They didn't really add anything significant since previous games and they left so very much to be desired. CoD 4 through Black Ops were all amazing, but I absolutley hated MW3 and Black Ops 2. However, these games were still able to hold my interest. Ghosts does not in any way, shape, or form hold my interest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"By far the worst CoD so far. This game is a huge dissapointment, I was banned for using a programme to change your FOV because at the time the game didn't even have an option to change the FOV. So after I get it they say it is allowed to be used and for awhile the game was playable. But then they changed there minds and said that the FOV changer was now banned and the only way you would have known that is if you followed them on twitter! The games has the worst optimization ever, it is basically a console port and stutters all over the place. 70% of the people that play are hackers so almost every game you get into there will most likely a hacker in it. DON'T BUY THIS GAME."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is terrible, $30.00 wasted on this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Multiplayer is stupid, everytime i round a corner i get killed because of this stupid 'Rubber Band' effect. The enemy somehow sees me before I see them. Call of Duty is the same game through out the series. NOTHING changes! The makers Fail to fix the most common errors in their games. They also fail to create a different aspect to a First person shooter, It's always kill the bad guy and lose a good guy here and there. Seriously get real Treyarch or Infinity Ward."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just the same game, again and again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Guns in space and Dynamic dog fur, but no FoV slider.  Sound like IW to you, ye this is one lazy shoddy game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is Call of Duty in its finest form yet, as far as the series is concerned. However, as far as the PC iteration goes, this is Call of Duty: Ghosts in its worst form, as the optimization in this port ranks just under 'Utterly Unplayable' for most.  While some users can play the game just fine on rigs of varying power, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to what causes the game to lag, stutter, freeze or otherwise graphically glitch for others. However, it is prevalent enough that the community has made an outcry as to what needs fixed and how little fun they're having until it does. Patches that have dropped thus far for the game have had results across the grid varying from fixing some players' problems to causing problems for another whom never had any to begin with.  It's not to say that the PC version of Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't fun, or even that it's terrible, but until further patches may alleviate the issues plaguing this port, it's best to steer clear and play on the consoles for this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC version is horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ there's no other way to put it. There are Â£3.50 indie snotter game sthat are more acomplished than this drivel. Infinty Ward do the world a favour go out of business and take activison down with you.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST GAME OF ALL TIME, ONLY BUY TO LAUGH. KTHNX."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"just for the 6GB RAM Limitation even if it has been fixed now this game sucks, I had to buy RAM to play this and then they just changed the RAM Requirements to 4GB!! Nice of them to make me waste my money and on top of that the game has other issues also(check online) !!! Thank God I was wise enough to just buy the normal version of the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is the tenth, most recent entry in the popular shooter franchise -- itâ€™s also the worst. With years of experience creating games under the developerâ€™s belt, and the leap to next generation consoles, one might expect drastic improvements in this yearâ€™s installment. But in several ways -- the campaign, the multiplayer, the features -- Ghosts is a significant step back from Black Ops II.  The problems begin with the single-player story. Black Ops II, the last Call of Duty game, made impressive strides to make the campaign more meaningful. Players could make choices that heavily affected the story, there were optional missions, characters were at least half-developed, and the near-future setting allowed for some interesting new gameplay mechanics.   Ghosts ignores all of these advancements, going back to the linearity and contemporary setting of the Modern Warfare games. Once again, America is under attack from a foreign threat. This time, itâ€™s the â€œFederationâ€, a wholly contrived and under-explained foe made up of every country in South America who somehow manage to take over a US satellite weapon (think a drone on steroids) and destroy half the west coast.   There are also some deliciously misguided attempts at creating an emotional connection to the characters, eschewing actual character-building in favor of cheap emotional moments. Specifically, the exchanges with the main characterâ€™s father ring as incredibly manipulative and false, with a lot of unearned â€œIâ€™m so proud of you, son!â€ moments. Dialogue is often risible as well, with such gems as, â€œYou were never a Ghost, Rorkeâ€¦â€ â€œIâ€™m better than a Ghost now!â€ when the main villain of the game is confronted. This is a shame, considering Ghosts was written by the Academy-Award-winning screenwriter of Traffic, Stephen Gaghan.   The gameplay itself during the story is a dull rehash of the previous entries in the series. One could almost go through the single-player with a checklist of once-impressive events from past Call of Duty games and tick off every box. Slow-motion door breaches? Check. Dramatic first person deaths? Check. Running through chaotic, exploding environments in a linear path? Double check. Between these bombastic moments is the same aim and shoot gameplay from every previous game; the player slogs through dozens of enemies to shoot at a time. Besides some fleeting moments of interest, like an underwater stealth sequence and a heated firefight on top of a speeding train, the campaign is a chore -- or, it would be, if it was any longer than a paltry four hours.   The multiplayer fares better, but only barely. Players still customize the weapons they use and the â€œperksâ€ they have, choosing unique abilities such as replenishing ammo for their guns or not showing up on the enemyâ€™s radar; the shooting still feels snappy and agile, letting the player quickly take opponents down. All of these features have been great in past Call of Duty games, and theyâ€™re still fun here.  This is undermined by every other aspect of the multiplayer, which, for the most part, has been changed for the worse. Plenty of emphasis is put on the â€œSquadsâ€ system, which lets the player outfit multiple soldiers with different loadouts and take their â€œsquadâ€ into several new game modes. This sounds interesting in theory, but unfortunately, in practice, this means having to level up several different characters, and starting with basic equipment multiple times if the player wants to have an effective squad. Unsurprisingly, this isnâ€™t fun, and leads to an entire section of the multiplayer feeling pointless. The normal game modes donâ€™t come out unscathed, either, with several fan favorites from previous entries -- like Headquarters -- being gutted. Most of the maps -- with the exception of Sovereign, which is a fantastic, multi-layered factory -- are mediocre and too large for their own good, making it more common to look for opponents than actually fight them. Overall, the multiplayer can still be enjoyable, but it has lost its lustre.   Which can be said for all of Ghosts, really; time has not been kind to the Call of Duty formula. The single-player is a hollow, laughable affair with but a few redeeming qualities. Shooting other people in the face over and over in multiplayer can still be fun, but most of the changes made noticeably detract from it. Compared to Black Ops II, and even on its own merits, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a sparsely entertaining experience, one thatâ€™s mildly amusing at its best; itâ€™s not worth its $60 price tag to all but the most desperate Call of Duty fans.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't get this game it's terrible and has terrible support and i didnt even get started on the gameplay.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game for PC. It does not work properly and even after trying to apply community-made fixes, it still doesn't perform well. This game was released long ago and Infinity Ward has ignored the PC gaming community completely due to lack of patches and fixes for their broken release. The game is a waste of internet download time, since the game is around 40 GB, but the game itself doesn't look any more grahpically intensive. The FOV is locked at a nauseous 65, though the gaming community has unofficial FOV changers.   In Ghosts Multiplayer, IW tried to copy Black Ops 2 style of weapon loadouts and class editing, but instead made a huge mess with too many split up perks and guns with forced attachments (like a silencer). Customization was thought to be increased with the new player editor, but this game has far less customization than before. Each Soldier can only carry six different loadouts and you can't customize them much more than their skin color until you play Multiplayer and complete certain objectives to gain clothing. You are only able to change the soldier's outfit as a whole, except for the headpiece. There are no more custom emblem editors in the game, you now have to use premade patches created by IW.   Multiplayer itself could have been a fun experience, but I wouldn't be able to tell you since the game is broken and not playable for me. Multiplayer is locked at 91 FPS while I have a 144hz screen and a more than capable GPU of running this game. As of 12/21/2013 I have only put around 30 hours into this game and have uninstalled it due to it wasting space on my hard drive.   Avoid this game.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money on this poor console port.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth it. CoD sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is optimized for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. dont buy until it gets patched.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too many disconnects and hackers..and they do nothing about it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i waste my money for a not finished game. apparently that's not made for pc. so don't buy it!.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a good game, but dissapointing in the way that it is probably the worst COD to date. There are some serious issues that need to be fixed, patched, and gotten rid of. Infinity Ward certainly must of known of these issues, yet they show a lack of responsibility by letting them slide, and now all COD players have to suffer. I hope you sleep well at night Infinity Ward, because it won't last long. -_-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a half finished game. This game is only really worth $5-$10. You must have a high end PC to even run this game. This is an awful port of the console version. In the game's settings there is not FOV slider and the game will lag no matter how good of a PC you have. People who even have an Titan lag this game. Even on lowest settings the game will lag. The multiplayer is non-inovative and in my opinion is worse than Black Ops 1 and 2. The maps are either to large and labyrinth like or small with awful spawning. The game has many graphical issues when it comes to lighting. The graphics in this game are not on par with what you should expect from a multi-million dollor game. Lots of assets have been reused from past Modern Warfare games, such as gun animations, gun textures, and other textures in the landscape. The campaign is ok but each mission is only about 13 minutes long and the game ends on a cliffhanger so they can make more money later. If you want to buy an FPS go spend your $60 on Battlefield 4, even though it has some bugs, the game is a hell of alot better than Call of Duty: Ghost. If you want a Call of Duty game, then spend your money on an Call of Duty game thats not made by Infinity Ward."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game does not run too well even with a high end PC. Save your money and buy something that actually is optimized for PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not good at all. It's unoptomized and plays like crap.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,buggy mess with no support at all from the poor excuse for a developer which is infinity ward
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just the same game, again and again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not only the worst call of duty i own but the worst game, wish i could get a refund there is no good part of this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the online game is already full of hackers and cheats the game is just barely a month old too the developers dont seem to be doing much and neither does steam I seriously wish i hadnt bought the game and the upcoming expansion at the same time. looks like this will be the last cod game i buy having been a loyal soldier/customer since the original cod  the online part is the biggest part of the game...if they cant fix that then it is pointless
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game was poorly made for the PC. You have to have at least a GTX 780 or something similar to run this game on high graphics with 60 FPS and I think that's just ridiculous for a CoD game. The multiplayer is dead on PC and for a good reason so if you're dying to play this online you're way better off playing this on consoles just becuase you can actually play any game mode without having to worry about the lobby being an empty. Could have been great but there's a huge lack of support when it comes to this game on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolutely broken PC port. Avoid this game at all costs.   Stuttering, FPS issues, memory leaks, and overall just a broken game.  Not to mention it feels exactly like MW3 and the map design is worse than any other Call of Duty I've ever played (and I've played all of them available on PC). This is not 'next-gen' or whatever the hell IW/Shitvision was claiming it would be. If you want more proof, look at the reviews, this game barely reaches a 6."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"absolutely the worst optimized game i have ever bought and played and i have 236 steam games at the moment,avoid at all costs.if you you are looking for a next gen shooter,try out battlefield 4 which i got on thansgiving day sale at origin for half off is a much better game,as a matter of fact cod:ghosts is not a quarter of the game that bf4 is,this a joke of a game,an early april fools joke,STAY AWAY......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is Call of Duty in its finest form yet, as far as the series is concerned. However, as far as the PC iteration goes, this is Call of Duty: Ghosts in its worst form, as the optimization in this port ranks just under 'Utterly Unplayable' for most.  While some users can play the game just fine on rigs of varying power, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to what causes the game to lag, stutter, freeze or otherwise graphically glitch for others. However, it is prevalent enough that the community has made an outcry as to what needs fixed and how little fun they're having until it does. Patches that have dropped thus far for the game have had results across the grid varying from fixing some players' problems to causing problems for another whom never had any to begin with.  It's not to say that the PC version of Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't fun, or even that it's terrible, but until further patches may alleviate the issues plaguing this port, it's best to steer clear and play on the consoles for this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy As Hell on PC, If you want it get a console and play it on that. To many Frame Drops"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is broken. the story makes no sense. the multiplayer (when working) is boring and frustrating, with an extra dash of all around lag. There is literally lag everywhere in this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you REALLY want to play a call of duty go buy black ops 2. Ghosts i found wasnt very enjoyable.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I beleive that this will still become the best cod game to date. Infinity ward has just not shown us the resolove to fix the games faults yet they have been addressing the wrong bug instead of making this game smoother to play 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Besides all the bad critique about the graphics etcetera, which are all true and already make the game a no-go, itâ€™s a paradise for hackers and cheaters. The producers are not doing a single thing to keep them from playing, which is a serious lack of respect to their customers. A shame, really. Is it so hard to program gaming software so it canâ€™t be altered in any, or at least more difficult way? Good thing for us they are not programming banking softwareâ€¦ Donâ€™t buy it, itâ€™s a waste of money. And I know, you really want to see it for yourself, as I wanted to see it for myself after reading all the bad reviews. After all, BO2 was and is so great, why should the last COD game be bad?? Well, itâ€™s terrible. Stay or go with Black Ops 2, by far the best COD game around. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ugh. If you are looking for a nice single player experience: this is not it, don't buy it!  This game is for the most part so linear it almost feels like a rail shooter. You get to participate in little pieces of the story, but you do not really have any impact on the story, you are just along for the ride, that's how it feels to me. All it comes down to is you need to do exactly what the game asks you to (kill bad guys, press 'X' to progress or not die). Fail to do so and you can just rewind &amp; repeat until you get it right. Story is set, no deviation possible.  Set pieces are impressive and have a large diversity and scale. The graphics are ok but not spectacular, the sounds are meh. Story is cringeworthy.  The campaign is very short (as was expected from previous CoD games), finished this in 5 and a half hours on normal and that was not rushed, just relaxed slow play.  I would say for single player this game is a complete waste of money at 50% off. It should be 80% off around â‚¬ 10,- , and even then it is not very good.  Maybe the multiplayer is fun, not tested so I don't know."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful PC Port, I made it half-way through the game on the lowest settings with a pair of Sapphire 5870â€™s while only crashing a few times. Once I made it to the underwater level the game would crash to desktop with a DirectX error at the exact same point every time right before the mission ended.   Then I bought a Sapphire R9 290X (4 GB card) and tried to play the level againâ€¦guess what happenedâ€¦..I made it 15 seconds farther without crashing!!!!!! How great is that!  No excuse to not be able to run ANY game on a 4GB card on the LOWEST settings. Donâ€™t buy the game, because it literally doesnâ€™t work.   My full specs:  I7 930 @3.4MHz  ASUS Rampage III Extreme  12GB Corsair Dominator GT DDR3 @1888  Sapphire R9 290X  Intel 120GB SSD  2X WD 1TB CB  Corsair HX1200"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bought the game a couple months after release and instantly was met with hackers using aimbots and wall hacks where's our dedicated servers so we can admin the people we play with. This used to be a family orientated game now the language and player names are offensive and just plain rediculous. All iw would have to do is try to make it 3 games in a row without running into issues in all of these areas. it's plain to see they stopped trying all together on this one. time to look at the bf franchise atleast they have dedicated servers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'd rather deep fry my balls in cow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than play this game ever again. Seriously don't even consider buying 'it' unless you're looking for a broken computer.  Worst game ever 0/10 Had to 'play' (lol yeah right) 3 more minutes before submitting this review due to the fact it requires 5 minutes of game time... infinityward... just die.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want it just for the single player fine grab it.  If you want it for the multiplayer side of things, just stay the hell away, this game is garbage for MP.  -Horriable lag compensation -Hack/cheat infested -Console port  0.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Camping Simulator 2013. Worst CoD ever, you can't see enemies and EVERY SINGLE killstreak is made to push you into camping.  1/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Most horribly optimized game I've ever played. I can recommend this for no one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thought it would be alright for $15. What a rip. Super buggy - what FPS have you played where scopes actually glitch and become useless? Hit detection and lag issues are many times worse than the initial problems plaguing BF4 when it launched. Those are just the most glaring issues.  Graphically, it's rather disgusting. I assumed that everything had defaulted to Low settings for some reason, but upon inspection, it was all set to High. It basically looks like Duke Nukem Forever and plays like Quake 3 Arena.  The whole game is generally a mess; it's split up into three different parts: Single Player, Competitive Multiplayer, and Co-Op Extinction. It doesn't even feel like one unified product which is very strange.  Single player features the typical Call Of Duty style large set pieces void of any interactivity and instead of letting you explore these environments, you are hurried to the next whatever to shoot more stuff. In some cases if you hang back to explore, you automatically fail the mission. Even the objectives you are pushed around to are unclear and not interesting except for bringing you closer to the next loading screen cutscene and towards the end of the game. I played for a few hours and decided it was just too dumb to waste my time with.  Multiplayer is pretty much Team Deathmatch since the majority of players (less than 400) were playing this. Due to the lack of dedicated servers, you have no control over what game you are entering. This sucks so hard. The time to kill for pretty much every weapon is super fast and due to lag, things can get really weird. Dying after running behind a wall, or getting killed before even hearing the multiple shots that took you out. It's gross. Watching the deathcam replays even shows in slow motion how janky the hit detection is - it is pretty damn funny.  Extinction has crashed every time I tried to play it, so maybe I'm missing out on why this game deserves more than $5?    If you are into early-access alpha versions of games, you might like this. Otherwise, save your cash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game features a lot of bugs,glitches and performance issues. It is not fun and not enjoyable! WARNING: I DO NOT RECOMMAND THIS GAME!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think that you should not buy this game it is a wast of $60 I got it on sale for $12. I say this because the story is good but it doese not makeup for the amount of crashes consantly I can not belive that this company expects peaople to pay $60 on a game that constantly crashes. The game isint all that bad but the crashes gets realy anoying. You can chrash mid game and lose all the XP its realy anoying. Oh yea did I metion that the game is 40 GB of storage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always been a fan of call of duty, even among a group of friends that hate the franchise. For some reason I can't stop buying. Well, now maybe I can. Not only are this game's graphics, gameplay, gunplay, and lighting completely dissfuntional, but the game just isn't interesting in any way. They didn't really add anything significant since previous games and they left so very much to be desired. CoD 4 through Black Ops were all amazing, but I absolutley hated MW3 and Black Ops 2. However, these games were still able to hold my interest. Ghosts does not in any way, shape, or form hold my interest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably one of the 'biggest' mistakes in my life...  For the games first launch and after spending over 80 dollars on this game..  The game doesnt even let me connect to their online services to play the game.. (multiplayer/extinction/squads)   So after spending 10 hours (yes 10 long hours..) of trying to troubleshoot and debug this 'spectacular' game i tried to get port forwarding, firewalls, networking and steam related issues done so i could have an Open Nat.. which i dont know if it has worked.. first it gives me an Open Nat then changed next time i log in to a Strict NAT so.. i dont know what that means..   After doing all this debugging.. it still gives me the same error which was:  'please check this link for updates' and its a website that shows the servers if they're available or not..  So after googling solutions from people who have had the same/similar problem and even customer support questions.. i still have the same problem..  Even if i do manage to get into the game itself, which of course is by a big f***king miracle... the game consists of lagg, stupid spawn points and more redonkulousness..  If i could ever get a full refund back from this franchise, i would be getting all my money back spent on ALL the CoD games that iv ever played in my entire life..    So you're asking me.. do i recommend this game?  Well.. why dont you go ahead and spend over 80 dollars on this game and see for yourself and tell me what you think.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No, don't ever buy the game.  I don't care if you accept this review or not, I just don't recommend. No, I pre-ordered it.  The campaign is just mostly about shooting people and only a few parts actually interest me (Free Fall for example). I'd like to see stealth parts (no, don't even mention that jungle escape).  The multiplayer is just average."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TERRIBLE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME IS JRFRGREGFGHGFHGFDHTFGHJGJHYFGJHYTJGHKJGF MAKES ME WANNA SMASH MY HEAD AGAINST KEYBAOARD GAMES ACTUALLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND GO AND KILL YOURSELF IF YOU BROUGHT IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought the gold version of this game. As soon as i launch the game and the screen goes black the game crashes.  If anyone know why, message me please."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you play this game, you're going to want to break your mouse."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy As Hell on PC, If you want it get a console and play it on that. To many Frame Drops"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game needs so much help it's not funny. the spawn pionts are sporatic. you will spawn right next to your eneny get shot and this will happen consistently in every game mode. If you are a hard core fan, this will be a disappiontment. very limited gun attachments and gun attachments that were in Black ops 2 are now perks, this makes it even more limited. crashed are daily.  I would not spend $60 on this game $15 maybe. $120 for the hardened pack NEVER."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Since i get this game i was waiting to download.. It take just 2 or 4 hour. Loaded and then a message pop up and said: DirectX uncoverable error. How can i fix this even i have good graphic card and my DirectX is updated and version 11.If you have this message youll gonna get mad cause youre 60$ is in the trash. So as what i say i didnt even played the game. And the guys who made cod:ghosts dont even made a solution or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the glitchiest game ever.... Join the game and it puts you in spectator mode, unable to get out. Join a game and you can only kill your team mates, not the enemy. Jump lobbies with the same 10 players with a game never starting, just cycling over and over. Other than that, great."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well unfortunately I wasted $120 on the Hardened version of Ghosts. I had high hopes because I truly loved the Modern Warfare games. This game is inconsistant, very choppy, and I am not a big fan of 'Squad Points' It seems as if there is not a very fair playing field either. My kills and deaths are a complete opposite from the other IW games. Quite embarrassing actually. The campaign, on the other hand, was very entertaining! That said, the campaign totally wasn't worth $120. I have a long time to wait until they put out another game, lets hope it is worth it. I won't be paying for Hardened next time that is for damn sure. Also every time a new set of maps come out the lag is so damn bad it isn't even worth playing...VERY frustrating!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't know why I did it... but I bought another Call Of Duty. Still using the same engine. Doesn't feel very 'next gen' at all. Optimized horribly, seriously. Doesn't matter if you meet system requirements or your PC is wayyy beyond them, this game is not going to perform well at all. Decided to play the campaign after a while. It's probably about even with B4 for story so not really worth the play through. Extinction is alright but I really don't even like it as much as zombies or IWs other game (seriously can't remember the name at all). Honestly if you get a next gen console maybe buy this, if you like COD that is, but on PC, avoid it... at all costs... even on Steam sales for that matter.  (update:) Worst thing of all the see through walls perks and killstreaks make this game absolutely terrible. Completely takes the fun out of the game. If you are using this perk now, you are basically done already. So many people are using it now and the game is unplayable that way for me. Ruins all the fun. Hope they get rid of it or turn it into the highest killsteak possible because at this point I will not play this game anymore.  (update:) Even at $40 on Steam sale now, don't get it. Activision doesn't even acknowledge the game has serious problems so who knows if or when they will be fixed.  (update 9/22/14:) This game had a horrible community like most CODs but this one is almost nonexistent now. The ones remaining are the typical crowd too. If you are a bro, racist or just generally annoying this game is for you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Playing you automaticly have jsut set your brain on stun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same thing every year. I reccomend that you wait to see post release footage of Advanced Warfare or play it before you decide to pre-order - might save you some hard earned cash :)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's crap too many campers and hackers 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst Game ever, just a money spinner now turned pay to win, laggy as F**k too, played every one and stopping at black ops 2, horrid series"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think the reason that they called it â€˜Ghostsâ€™ is because they have killed the franchise.  Infinity Ward was doing well with the MW series, the campaign was fun to play and the spec-ops missions in MW2 and MW3 were quite addictive and made me want to chase those 3 star ratings. Multiplayer also had me hooked, and even with some niggling complaints from some of the previous games (such as quickscoping), they were still enjoyable and soaked up untold hours of my life.  After the launch of MW3, Infinity Wardâ€™s Creative Strategist resigned, the following year Ghosts emerged.  Like a lot of other people, I was also led into a false sense of security and invested good money on this game. Only to find out that it would not even be worth the money at a quarter of the price. And instead of fixing al of the bugs, unbalanced multiplayer, ridiculous perks and booting hackers, they would much rather release $130 worth of DLC (to date).  The only positive thing that I can say about this game is that Alt+F4 still works.â€¦.. No more COD games for me, Iâ€™m now put off the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I swore off Call of Duty after MW3. I was pretty much done with the genre and I never liked Blops. I had not planned on buying Ghosts but a friend purchased it for me as an XMAS gift shortly after it launched. I am glad I didn't pay any out of pocket for this turd sandwich.  The single player is maybe 4 hours long and your typical shoot anything that moves and run away from those explosions. They put in a dog to have a cheap hit you in the feels moment. Acctually besides the bad guy the dog was the only other memorable character. But anyway I am not gonna rip on this game for it's single player, as nobody cares about Call of Duty for that.  This is the absolute worst multiplayer experience for a Call of Duty game yet. The maps were designed by some rookies, none of them even stood out and really had no kind of structure to them. The respawn points were ADHD, I can't even count how many times I respawned like 10 feet from where I died just to get shot by the same person again, and sometimes even a third time. The solider loadout customization and unlock system was like three steps backwards and royally sucked. Game was a rushed piece of crap, more than likely was outsourced. Don't buy it, don't waste your time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game for 15 bucks during a steam sale. When I first got it, my laptop couldnt even run the game because of its ridiculously unnecesary specs. But now that I am running on a gaming laptop, the game can barely run medium settings at a decent frame rate. On top of this, the servers dont function, and loading screens in multiplayer take forever. This was definitely not a smart buy, even for 15 bucks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I used to love call of duty. I had COD 1,UO,2,3,4,WoW,MW2,MW3,BO, and then BO II and ghost came out and ruined COD not even going to try AW.  (I aslos like how the most helpful are all neagative and if you go to only positive they are all negative still xD)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Up Front: I only played the Multiplayer, i can say nothing about the campain part.In Only Got the 5 Minutes of gameplay required for a review, as Steam wont let you review the Multiplayer.  Multiplayer needed 2Gb download on release date, why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to i buy a gamebox with 4(!) DVD's? To NOT have to download stuff. Either you release a game when its done or you delay the release, this was just bad. Graphics are worse than Black Ops 2, Audio options are nonexisting. Game kept crashing when loading into a multiplayergame due to grphic issues, had to go through all options one by one to find out which blocked me out, only to find that with all to max it still looks like from 4 years ago.   While Playing my first 15 hours I found that more often then not i had very bad pings (you shoot people, die, see the killcam, find out you never fired the 8 shots you know left your gun). Some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at Infinity Ward appearantly thought that setting the maximum ping for a Server to 800ms would be a good idea, and since there are no ping indicators ingame you wont even know. After changing the value manually by manimulating game configuration data the hard way (means with an classic editor/notepad) i had a harder time finding games (had to wait for about 3 Minutes for a server at times) but at least the gamequality was better. The promissed dedicated servers were nonexistant, some websearch gave me an Infinity Ward statement that they will be comming soon fter release. I haven't seen one of them by now, but hey at least IW will save some server money as the number of players willing to put up with this are falling by the minute.  Last but not least this game is a funfest for cheaters and hackers. And while you can try your best to ignore it, once in a while you may land in a hacked lobby. Of cause you wont know that till you try to capture a target in Domination or get a kill and gain 300 times as much exp as you should get. While that can be seen as a kind of boost on your way to max prestige, it pretty much sucks when you find people that are invulnerable, wallbang with an LMG at 50Kills 0Death rates, find out you just got a server where every weapon has amagazine capacity of 2 shots, where scores get manipulated or people run and jump at several times the normal speed like CoD mutated to some kind of Arena-Shooter. All i saw IW do to prevent this was as follows: Ignore for 2 months, try to grab more money by offering a new skin for a slightly overpowered killstreak (seriously? dogs kill before they even touch you? what happend to the good old time where you at least had 0.3 seconds to cut their throat before yours in ripped out?) for one month and now posting a message of the day saying 'Mimimi, please dont use their party Programs or we will report you to steam.' For me that read like 'When you hit me i call my mom' and sadly that is how the cheaters see it too.  The game was a massive disappointment, i am glad i did not get the season pass and burn more money on a technically old, at times laggy and hack and cheater ruined game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought several DLC for this.   Why did I do that.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Show your hate to someone this holiday by sending them this game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Still runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, even with a GTX 970. This is, by far, the worst Call of Duty port on the PC. Get this on the console if you really want to play it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not one to judge a game without playing through completely. I like to give games a chance, and that was my mistake with this. You would be farther ahead, and have more fun brushing your teeth with rusty barbwire dipped in hot slag.  Same game everytime, nothing about these titles change.Unbalanced weapons show clearly what weapons and perks the devs favor, hit detection is faulty as per tradition, and the player base is minimal ( less than 200 people at the time this review is written although there are over 22000 reviews ) The devs found a formula that works very well in fooling people into buying the same game over and over. As long as people keep purchasing these titles the devs will learn nothing except how to sleep soundly on piles of our hard earned munny and these titles will continue to stagnate.   Open your mind Quaid, save your munny. If you want a decent combt game play BF4 and completly skip this title and any past or future titles of the CoD series.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. This game is same story from World at war â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terrribly optimized and doesn't hold a solid 60fps even with a good card. and before anyone says its my setup i'm using, i run a 980Ti which should without a doubt eat this game alive even maxed out. This is what you get when you port a console coded game over to a platform which should have been developed seperately."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is pretty much dead on PC. Graphics is all dark and ugly even on full extra details and the only playable mode is TDM which is fun for the first 20 min then you get sick of it and delete the game. Other mod litteraly have no players  Don't buy unless you want to play TDM for life
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have 72 hours on multiplayer. This game SUCKS! The lag compensation is awful i have a good connection and i get killed by people with bad connections before they even come around the corner! its lag compensation and its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing FLAWED. if you play this game you'll be playin with a lot of players in mexico and their connections are terrible. If that werent bad enough theres hackers EVERYWHERE. Literally in each and every lobby also I was stoked with Gunnys' Drill Instructor voice pack but then they turn around and start promoting their Stoner DLC.... like really? FFS get some integrity that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pathetic
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only enjoyable things of this game were the reviews and the uninstalling process.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is fun just for first few hours then its starts to get boring same every match is the same not worth buyin
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst in the Series.MW2 Copy Paste.But much Worse.Nothing New.No New Engine just a Upgraded MW2 Engine.Dog is a Joke.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Game from IW  Cheaters and HACK! as always!   Just...crap   1/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Easily one of the most terrible, most boring games I've ever played.   Single Player - Mercifully short. They couldn't seem to make a level without some awful gimmick - fly a chopper and apathetically shoot at things, go underwater and shoot at a man, uhoh now he takes more bullets to kill! SPACE? Exciting. Now you're a fricken dog wowowowow  Multiplayer - Pretty much standard fare for every CoD game for the last 5 years. Exact same gameplay and the graphics are hardly better. You get the drop on a guy, you shoot him with laser bullets with no spread or recoil and he dies OR someone gets the drop on you and then you die. The only way to rack up more than 2-3 kills per death is to camp; and luckily with the right perks this game rewards camping. This game makes every other multiplayer shooter seem better just by existing.   Seriously, Battlefield 4 is more along the lines of what this game should have been. Amazing graphics &amp; sound, proper objective based gameplay and the shooting actually takes some skill.  I'd just like to say thanks to Rhys for making me buy this, the worst video game ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty..... Once a prestigious title among PC gaming now a shunned family member that brings embarrassment to FPS gaming. Instead of focusing on the game play itself and tuning the game to work well the developers seem to have attempted to throw as many perks and add-ons for weapons as they can even to the point that one of the kill streak rewards the 'oracle' is basically an in game wall hack.   The series has really fallen from its start where skills would be determined on using the actual gun to get kills but it seems the game is just a psycho massacre simulator for people these days with all you need is to get a few kills to activate a kill streak that doubles your score or once you achieve some of the higher level kill streaks you can become nearly invincible with a knife for a weapon.  It all seems pointless to me with a huge lack of community building that the game was so loved for, vCoD through to Modern warfare where people would host servers for their clans or general playgrounds and you would actually be able to make friends in the game and continue to discuss matters and have fun through the forums for these clans or playgrounds, building fun and enjoyable communities through the game where as today everything is automatically matched up the game will last 4 or so rounds and then you end up in another game with different people mostly filled by trolls, whiny kids and hackers.  With the lack of game play being based on the player actually having to aim their gun and the opportunity of building fun and exciting communities the game is a real let down since the end of the first modern warfare it really has just been one massive downhill disappointment.  2/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sucks the big fat one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"enjoyed all the codz .. enjoyed thissin.. but the campaign is extreamly short... 6 hours for me, compaired to the 20+ hours it took for each of the last two releases. then theres the runnin down a hallway fealing i was getting.... even in space... i give it a 7/10... i did enjoy it.. but its not a $50 game. not for the multiplayer, witch is kinda broken from what i hear. soo.. not recommended, to spendy for what your gettin.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,They got Stephen Gaghan to write this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothing special about Ghosts comparing to the previous CoD titles, and they just made the game much easier to pick up and faster pace."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is awful. Campaign is great.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is by far the WORST CoD game in the series. This is the last one for me, it is trully awful!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the sadest game ever. Singleplayer - crashes... device removed (error).. every time at the same point.  After the infrared Mission at the end of a corridor (through a window you can see a helicopter), when i turn left to the doors - crash (iÂ´ve tried anything, for example i moved backwards to the door....through the door - turn left - crash)  Multiplayer - crashes...device removed (error).   In BF3 or BF4 i have no problems with my rig.

Logitech G35 Headset (no Logitech Driver installed!)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well there is a bad side and a good side but I honestly think that the bad side is too much I think the the Multiplayer is kinda bad and Maybe I dont play it well but you will die too quick so its not gonna be easy and many other issue that you will find in this game but the good side is the story mode is a pretty well done job and the Aliens mode is pretty fun but If you are like me that finds game fun only in Shooting Other People in games I would think that this game is not that great of a multiplayer though its only my Opinion some of you might not agree with me because each people have a different opinion so yeah if your looking for a New Mode in Call Of Duty well you should try this but like i said if your more of a Multiplayer Shooting Players VS Players guy than I would highly recommend not to waste your 60$. Peace
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Biggest flop of the year. High Budget game being released while it is only 50% complete, so many basic functions still missing. Good Job IW!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want it just for the single player fine grab it.  If you want it for the multiplayer side of things, just stay the hell away, this game is garbage for MP.  -Horriable lag compensation -Hack/cheat infested -Console port  0.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth the money. poorly optimized for pc runs like garbage and the multiplayer is just boring. maps have no creativity and doesn't compare to treyarchs black ops counterpart. this is a fail on activisions part and does nothing to fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It was cool for about a week, then it started to get old. The game runs like a 600 pound penguin going up a hill. No matter what setting I have it on, or resolution, it still is slow. The graphics look like MW2, and I have constant stuttering and crashes/freezes. When I bought the game, I had 8GB of RAM, and when I installed it, it wouldn't run and itwould just crash. The next day I went out and spent $120 on a 16GB RAM kit, and it still ran like trash. I tried to play this to find something I liked about it, thats why I have 70 hours on it, but I never could find anything. I would pay to have IW remove it from my PC, because it was just using hard drive space until I uninstalled it. For reference, I have an i7 4770K, a GTX 760, and 16GB of RAM. Let me just say, Battlefield wasn't the greatest release ever, but atleast they are trying to fix it. I get constant 30FPS no matter what settings, and it dips bellow almost all the time. Even at discount, I wouldn't buy it. It's really unstable and takes a lot of resources. Don't buy it unless you have a $3000 or so system. 0/10, I wish I could go lower but i can't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful PC Port, I made it half-way through the game on the lowest settings with a pair of Sapphire 5870â€™s while only crashing a few times. Once I made it to the underwater level the game would crash to desktop with a DirectX error at the exact same point every time right before the mission ended.   Then I bought a Sapphire R9 290X (4 GB card) and tried to play the level againâ€¦guess what happenedâ€¦..I made it 15 seconds farther without crashing!!!!!! How great is that!  No excuse to not be able to run ANY game on a 4GB card on the LOWEST settings. Donâ€™t buy the game, because it literally doesnâ€™t work.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is broken. the story makes no sense. the multiplayer (when working) is boring and frustrating, with an extra dash of all around lag. There is literally lag everywhere in this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have every COD game...Ghosts just not fun...sorry for review..but that's the way I see it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you REALLY want to play a call of duty go buy black ops 2. Ghosts i found wasnt very enjoyable.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Camping Simulator 2013. Worst CoD ever, you can't see enemies and EVERY SINGLE killstreak is made to push you into camping.  1/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly, I didn't know what I expected. It's a re-hash of the old games, same boring stuff, and it runs worse than the other games, what's not to love? I was going to write a witty bad review, but honestly, this game isn't even worth THAT time. So at the end of the day, don't buy this game unless it's under 5 bucks.. Even then, that's a stretch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bought the game a couple months after release and instantly was met with hackers using aimbots and wall hacks where's our dedicated servers so we can admin the people we play with. This used to be a family orientated game now the language and player names are offensive and just plain rediculous. All iw would have to do is try to make it 3 games in a row without running into issues in all of these areas. it's plain to see they stopped trying all together on this one. time to look at the bf franchise atleast they have dedicated servers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thought it would be alright for $15. What a rip. Super buggy - what FPS have you played where scopes actually glitch and become useless? Hit detection and lag issues are many times worse than the initial problems plaguing BF4 when it launched. Those are just the most glaring issues.  Graphically, it's rather disgusting. I assumed that everything had defaulted to Low settings for some reason, but upon inspection, it was all set to High. It basically looks like Duke Nukem Forever and plays like Quake 3 Arena.  The whole game is generally a mess; it's split up into three different parts: Single Player, Competitive Multiplayer, and Co-Op Extinction. It doesn't even feel like one unified product which is very strange.  Single player features the typical Call Of Duty style large set pieces void of any interactivity and instead of letting you explore these environments, you are hurried to the next whatever to shoot more stuff. In some cases if you hang back to explore, you automatically fail the mission. Even the objectives you are pushed around to are unclear and not interesting except for bringing you closer to the next loading screen cutscene and towards the end of the game. I played for a few hours and decided it was just too dumb to waste my time with.  Multiplayer is pretty much Team Deathmatch since the majority of players (less than 400) were playing this. Due to the lack of dedicated servers, you have no control over what game you are entering. This sucks so hard. The time to kill for pretty much every weapon is super fast and due to lag, things can get really weird. Dying after running behind a wall, or getting killed before even hearing the multiple shots that took you out. It's gross. Watching the deathcam replays even shows in slow motion how janky the hit detection is - it is pretty damn funny.  Extinction has crashed every time I tried to play it, so maybe I'm missing out on why this game deserves more than $5?    If you are into early-access alpha versions of games, you might like this. Otherwise, save your cash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always been a fan of call of duty, even among a group of friends that hate the franchise. For some reason I can't stop buying. Well, now maybe I can. Not only are this game's graphics, gameplay, gunplay, and lighting completely dissfuntional, but the game just isn't interesting in any way. They didn't really add anything significant since previous games and they left so very much to be desired. CoD 4 through Black Ops were all amazing, but I absolutley hated MW3 and Black Ops 2. However, these games were still able to hold my interest. Ghosts does not in any way, shape, or form hold my interest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a die hard fan for Call of Duty since the beginning.  I am truly dissapointed with what has become of the series.  Sadly, I won't support any more of Infinity wards games.   Not reccomended."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'd rather go buy Black ops 2 again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"*Sigh* Call of Duty: Ghosts  Pros: + Singplayer is great, even though there are many scripted events. The story is pretty much ok to me.  + Graphics, hmm looks decent although couldn't compare to the next gen games. + Multiplayer is fun with lots of customizations. + Extinction mode is fun.  Cons: + Purely unoptimized for the pc. + Too much stuttering and fps drops very often even on high end computers. + Multiplayer is repetitive. You can't use jets, tanks, jeeps etc. + Crashes for no reason. + And thaaaat loading screen. Trust me, my Battlefield 4 loads faster than this game. + BUGS! + For a AAA game, there's not much people playing right now.  Conclusion Previous titles are much better esp. Black Ops II and Modern Warfare 3. In my opinion, this game is not worth $60. But if your truly interested on this title, better spend your $60 on console version. PC version is 'CRAP'. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was looking forward to this game. Coming off of (what i thought) was fantastic multiplayer in Blops2 i expected IW to build on the great multiplayer model created by Treyarch. I have never been more wrong about anything in my life.  This game is an insult to pc gaming. Terrible FPS drops for no reason, rediculous system requirements for a game that looks worse than its predecessors, all around bad optimization. It almost seems as though IW hates Treyarch because they completely threw out the Blops2 multiplayer model.   The gameplay is essentially what you would expect from any IW CoD game, except with added lag and frustration. IW seems to have tried to make the game playable with 1 or 2 patches, but its too little too late. The game has literally no player base on steam anymore. The game launched with the promise of dedicated servers, which were never implemented, but at least we got additional dog fur textures, fish AI and PERFECT CIRCLES on our scopes!  The single player is fun for what it is. If you played any CoD campaign you've played Ghosts. Story is weak at best, but still fun. Dog mechanic is interesting and unfortunately only used once or twice. The single player runs just as badly as the multiplayer, but seems to look slightly better. The levels are diverse some being fun and memorable.   Extinction mode however is fun. Its essentially zombies from Blops, but with aliens, and more objectives.  If this game ran properly and cost $15 it would be a game you could buy and not hate yourself for. Currently the game isnt worth buying, even for the single player/extinction mode. Even if IW were to fix the issues with the game the playerbase is no longer there.   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,activision sould be ashamed on what they have done to the cod franchise
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just another garbage game from Infinity Ward.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor game, not optimised for PC or for Euro gamers. Runs like dogsmess even with top spec pc.   Too much detail going on in the maps detracts away from gameplay.  NOT RECOMMENDED  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Plays badly, poor optimization and full of hackers. COD never again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is interesting only Extinction mode, but the multiplayer died on Ghost! A company is just something very bad, as you can shoot a machine gun in space because it violates the laws of physics, and in extinction little cards alone Point of Contact boring one needs more !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"it's too bad that you need to pay for every special upgrade, it's not the best the cod developers can do... i've seen better"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not so great. Story is ok &amp; has a cliff hanger but other than that I dont really like this from the rest of the CODs. Not worth $60 really... :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If their was a way to translate 'I can count to potato' to a game this would be the result.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same old **** horrible optimisation, multiplayer is no longer fun so in my mind it's a dead series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly think buying this game has been the biggest mistake of my life. It has been clear that infinityward has stopped putting effort in to their games, but this is without a doubt the worst cod game, and is probably the downfall of the series.   Do not buy this game and stop supporting infinityward, they put zero effort in to their pc ports.  The only parts of the game that were decent were the missions that they copied and pasted from other call of duty games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, If you need cod, please go buy an older one. Or go play a free FPS, you will have better experiences there. ALSO don't recommend purchasing Advanced Warfare. Turns out its the same situation as this game, a horribly optimized game, full of FPS drops, awful graphics, hacker infested multiplayer, garbage multiplayer gameplay, lame single player, a sorry secondary game mode. (extinction, or the dlc zombies in AW's case)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer maps are pretty bad due to their large size. Weapons are mediocre and it's difficult to find a weapon to be comfortable with. The ranking and unlocking system is a bit broken. There's always at least one modder in a lobby. No one is ever playing so the online play is pretty pointless, with as high as 2 people in some game modes. There are no visual upgrades in comparison to the last several Call of Duty games. Lots of hiding places for campers who love to use the thermal scope to kill you across the entire map with ease. Dogs are annoying because it takes what feels like an entire clip just to kill them, yet one shot to your own leg and you die. They added sliding in the game but it doesn't help avoid being killed since you still die even when you're not aimed at, and the reaction time is screwed up. This game is just not as fun as the previous. Infinity Ward always makes pretty bad Call of Duty games. Later this year when Treyarch releases their new Call of Duty, the franchise might be saved unless they destroyed that, but Treyarch are the kings of Call of Duty, so fingers crossed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i bought this game as i have been playing mw2 up until this point, however i might aswell have stuck with it.. this game is literally just a regurgitation of the past and im not even joking when i say thier are borderline identical scenes from mw2 in this (watch cod ghosts exposed). beyond sqauds and a point system revamp for classes and a couple new weapon attatchements.. i see very little creativity since mw2. having said this i am pleased with the addition of sqauds although i wouldnt recommend it.. to anyone.. ever"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding me? This was the worst campaign that Infinity Ward as ever given us. I normally do not play games to be realistic, but come the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on! At least try! Worst ending to anything ever made ever. Way to slap a 'Call of Duty' title on this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and call it a game. Only reason I would recommend this game is if you like multiplayer. Other than that get your noose ready because this game sucks. Call of Duty is as forever living as Roark."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is great if you live at home and have time to play all day and night. It is full of campers and cheaters and reporting is useless.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game was a waste of $60. I have constant connecton lag and constant frame rate issues even though my computer far surpasses the recomended requirments. This is probably going to be the last COD game I buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"2.4 KD, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. Hackers, laggs !! Infinity Ward like. Im going to continue playing Treyarch Games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really, really wish I could like this game but, its so laggy for me and multiplayer won't even launch. :?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, you get the COD experience. Wait you don't?? I went into this game from another fps with an open-mind. Then realized the multiplayer community had either fizzled out or never existed. (Wouldn't surprise me considering the boycotts, especially on steam.) The ONLY multiplayer modes that were running games were Team deathmatch and... Hardcore TMD. No Search and Rescue. If you drop the ben's on the game, dont expect anyone else to be playing it with you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is truely the worst call of duty to date, i have never before thought i wasted money on a game untill i bought this game. Graphic has been downgraded, the control seems so different from all other games.  This game is really not worth money, this bulls**t is the last call of duty i will buy.  Give me my money back!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wow, i should have known what I was getting myself into, but, hey, it's a game, RIGHT! Turns out that the single player experience is nothig more than an onrail shooter, go here do this, shoot that and, let me get that door. Never have I wanted a game to finish more than this, never have I wanted the boredom to end. GAH! the singple player experience is nothing more then me pushing buttons to achieive the developers/creators vision! What the hell happened to games? Why must they control everything we see and do? Why , oh Why do we have to trudge through endless repetitive crap to get to a boring and unsatisfactory ending? Please let this franchise and Battlefield go back to what they were good at . Their WW2 shooters were the best.. These games today are totally taking the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. F**K the pretty graphics! GIVE ME GREAT GAMEPLAY! Hope the multiplayer side is better and not full of hackers and slackers with kiddie scripts. i miss the good Ol'Days of gaming! 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only buy this game if:  -It's on sale -You have absolutely no other games to play -You're addicted to the franchise -Your PC is up-to-snazz -You don't play seriously  The single-player story mode was ok. The multiplayer portion just makes you feel like you're a war drone mindlessly killing people for fun, and the lack of a FOV slider doesn't help at all. The game is terribly optimised for PC. I play this game when I'm not animating or when I'm super bored."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"An utterly lazy attempt by Activsion to recapture its former glory. The same rehashed game mechanics, a dismally written story mode with a completely impossible premise. The graphics look dated and state compared to its contemporaries. Even the color pallate is bland an uninspiring.   This is the last Call of Duty game that I buy unless there are dramatic changes. Return the game to its roots, lets go back to Germany, France and Russia.  2/10 Would not recommend."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cod is dead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is just the same as the others.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game i ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Game but activision does nothing about the hackers. Not much fun playing when the other players have aimbots, wallhacks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, but the only thing bad is that no one takes responsability for the gaming comunity when it comes to the cheating. We pay a lot of money to have a fair and fun game and so far is the same story over and over, before a game is released there is a release in multiple cheats that destroys the game and makes it feel as it the game creators dont care at all in catching these people and worst they get away with it for multiple version of the game. Besides that I keep getting a lag everytime I start the game no matter on what resolution is the same feeling of a strange lag my PC is more than good enough to handle this game on max setting so Im not sure what the problem is... ASUS GJ73 laptop latest drivers.. Sincerly If I dont see an improvement on this game son I might have to end this long relation of mine with the game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To many hackers and lack of community support, a broken report system and instead of fixing the issues with the game, they keep releasing dlcs tryign to get more money off this broken game! Horrible!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is a $50 paperweight  The game on other platforms is just short of being a $50 paperweight, thereâ€™s still a lot of bugs and it seems the makers of the game only care about the media, counting that the past 5 updates have had to do with pro players and the app, alongside in-game skins for money. You would think after gaining a lot of money from the in-game add-ons, the makers would spend that money to making and fixing the broken game.  Now, for the campaign...the story was trash, I beat campaign on the hardest difficulty in 4 hours, also the campaign played with as many bugs as there are in an ant farm. Finally but not last, due to all the bugs, lag, glitches, in-game flaws, and all around problems we get to online. After you set all of your setting to as low as possible and your game looks like youâ€™re playing on a 90s TV with screen tarring and lag so bad if you jump while standing still, your character to other players looks like your hovering. A point system to level your character, is provide for you, this includes points thatâ€™s seem to be given but thatâ€™s a bug, and enough points that by prestige 5 youâ€™ll have enough to get 1 gun. Lastly if youâ€™re feeling a mod will fix your in game problems, from my experience your rightâ€¦. the in game problems can be fixed with a mod, but sadly after 2 days of playing with a mod fixing the game and making it playable VAC will ban you as I found out today.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game can go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it self keeps crashing with maxed setting every 5 to 10 mins -_- fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to be honest i think its rubbish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game the Madden developers would blush at how little they tried to make anything better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Piad for the game...  Trying to squeeze all the fun I can out of it. Trying to make my payment even slightly worth it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a buggy piece of crap. Single Player is stable, but the Multiplayer consistently crashed after about 3mins of play through 3 driver updates. By far the buggiest, least stable MP game of the series. Disappointing, to say the least. I would be livid if I didn't get it at a discount. As it stands, I'm only thoroughly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horribly Optimized, looks more a Console Port than an actual PC game. Totally over-priced. If you got the spare Money, its a good Gift to your Worse Enemy. Buy it when the Price drops or on a Promotion, otherwise its burned money. My opinion? Buy Battlefield 3 or 4 over this, way better deal..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs great on my PS4 but runs like crap on my gaming PC (8 core @3.9, 2 7850's in crossfire, 8 GB RAM @ 1736, with an SSD). Multiplayer is trash on PC the campaign is decent so if you're buying for MP get a console instead however if you just want to play the campaign PC should suffise. Hackers are out of control on PC and seem to be left alone since I have seen the same Hackers playing since release. Since I am rating mainly for PC MP I will NOT be recommending this atrocity!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I liked some aspects about this game, alot i didn't   Here's my review:      Single-Player:"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought it for $60 to play the Extinction mode, though not bad. It feels like it was tacked on quickly. The campaign was okay, but nothing compared to Black Ops 2's story where they actually tried new things. The main issue is the multiplayer. The key selling factor of the game (I barely know anyone who plays CoD for the story). The singleplayer and Extinction mode's work fine, until you play the multiplayer aspect of the game. You'll be getting constant FPS drops and will run into hackers A LOT (granted the FPS drops will vary but majority of players are still having these issues including me w/ my AMD FX-8120 and GTX 760) I usually have to play on everything low at 720p to get a steady framerate, but some maps STILL cause you to drop frames constantly. Not only that, but they promised dedicated servers but I keep getting P2P connections. I'd say pick up Black Ops 2 if you want a good experience on PC, I sadly don't own it on PC (I have it on PS3) but that games WAY better than Ghosts. Avoid this title unless you're REALLY wanting this game. It had potential to be a different CoD experience, and it failed on every level."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the wrost cod ever played full of hackers bugs and a lot of lag dont waste money on this Infinity Ward and Activision just dont respects the costumer and have made the battlefield looks like game of the year.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"single player works fine,  not got round to finishing it yet.     but like ALOT of peeps out there the MP is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed When ever i try to run it always freezes on the menu screen in a few seconds. IW/atv have not bothered fixeing or addressing the issue . damn shame i cant get a refund  well now finished the SP while it was enjoyable it wasnt as good as the first modern warfare games, heck in 3 was better than this. it also borrowed set pieces from the other COD games theres nothing new. story arc seems to be bit of both blops and specops line mashed up very badly. treyarch are doing things better with blops, IW should stick to a story line that follows exploits of cpt Price (brilliant lunatic who saves the world by setting of a h000ge â™¥â™¥â™¥ bomb)  under water and orbital fight sequences were dull , cod 4 had chernoble, mw2 had no russian, mw3 had soaps death, blop had the prison break, blops 2 had the floating island. even the f***king dog is under used in the game.   and the sequel hinted at the end is gona be even more like blops    one brother is gona get brain washed and other brother is gona die trying to save him      tbh screw this game buy spec ops when its next on sale  mp is still f**ked"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Most poorly optimised game on my list of games runs horribly, terrible textures, bad fps spikes and of course a 50gb install."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks infineti ward has just sold it without being completele finishedit is just pourlie optimisd (srry for my english)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Save your money and do not buy this game,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,For Russian PC version: - Season Pass is not available; I think It's not good... - Ghost server is not available Your f!cking store is available always? - If Steam Client updated Ghost is crashing + Suck my d!ck deep more!!! Maybe Cheaters get satisfaction faster. - Game server is not available for 200 billions dollars. It's right? :::)))
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is BYFAR the junkiest COD ever made to date for Pc .It takes off from mw3 stoped and goes down hill from there , The camo glows ,the grafics are a joke even with every thing maxed out . Save your money unless they give it to ya for $12.99 then it mite be ok lol , bad bad game . just a repeat of a ole game that was junk (MW3) and this is even Junkier . They got me this time but next year it will be them who gets hit . I for one will wait for reviews before buying anymore COD games ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seriously disappointing game. Single player gameplay lasts less than 3.5 hours on Hardened. I should have gone to a movie instead. Would have been cheaper and more fulfilling. Don't waste your cash on this sorry excuse for a COD game. This has no place in the franchise.Wis I could get my money back. At least I have not wasted too much of my life on this!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Whatever you do, do not buy this game. It's gotten to the point where you cannot play a game without there being at least one person using an aimbot, or wall hacks, or both. Either VAC doesn't work or IW doesn't care about their game. Either way, save your money and avoid this like the plague."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its not optimised and the game play isnt that great. Have to upgrade computer to high specs when the graphic isn't spectacular anyway.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very poorly developed; full of rookie level programming mistakes. Add the fact the single player content is less than 6 hrs long, I see no reason for anyone to bother with playing this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Seriously don't buy this game.. o.o My pc should easily be able to run this game, i suffer no frame drops that other people have mentioned, but my pc gets hotter than usual and the game is prone to crashing?  Multiplayer is pretty awful, from an in game look, it's the most campy call of duty ever... They've made it much easier for people to just sit there and rack up kills, the objectives are ignored, frustrating as hell.  The guns don't have that awesome feel that other infinity ward games did :( The maps are ridiculously designed.. :o  Most of all the pc servers for me in the UK anyway are DEAD.. No one plays it at all, there are actually playlist with like 3 people in them, even at prime times. This may be because it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, or loads of people just struggle to run it. :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Spec too high, online multiplayer is the slowest game i have played so far,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game can go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it self keeps crashing with maxed setting every 5 to 10 mins -_- fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to be honest i think its rubbish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WASTE OF MONEY! I can run any game at max settings, why are my FPS crap? Why does everything lag? Wost COD to date, I bought it when it was 50% off and still regret it. If only I could get a refund somehow."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a buggy piece of crap. Single Player is stable, but the Multiplayer consistently crashed after about 3mins of play through 3 driver updates. By far the buggiest, least stable MP game of the series. Disappointing, to say the least. I would be livid if I didn't get it at a discount. As it stands, I'm only thoroughly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horribly Optimized, looks more a Console Port than an actual PC game. Totally over-priced. If you got the spare Money, its a good Gift to your Worse Enemy. Buy it when the Price drops or on a Promotion, otherwise its burned money. My opinion? Buy Battlefield 3 or 4 over this, way better deal..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs great on my PS4 but runs like crap on my gaming PC (8 core @3.9, 2 7850's in crossfire, 8 GB RAM @ 1736, with an SSD). Multiplayer is trash on PC the campaign is decent so if you're buying for MP get a console instead however if you just want to play the campaign PC should suffise. Hackers are out of control on PC and seem to be left alone since I have seen the same Hackers playing since release. Since I am rating mainly for PC MP I will NOT be recommending this atrocity!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Gameplay: 6/10 Graphics: 3/10 Originallity: 4/10 Longevity: 3/10 Story: 3/10  Overall: 4/10  WORST CALL OF DUTY YET!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game sucks so much ,it sucks more than a vacuum"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,When the COD people start charging for every litttle extra for a game..time to get out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST COD GAME EVER, DONT BUY THIS Don't have FPS Calibration, don't have dedicated server.This game is unoptimized garbage and a pure insult to PC gamers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am deleating this game as I can get so far and then I am killed and cant do a thing about it not good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how can i buy just the weapons? 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a ok game. I just hate that they dont update this game on time. I have been waiting on the new dlc for a month.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst load of carp you'll buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"why in the world would you EVER release a game in a state as bad as CALL OF DUTY GHOSTS! it has the following.... lag, hackers, glitches, graphical errors, weird animations and probably the worst guns in cod history.... and all wraped up in that 60$ price tag. good job activision... GOOD JOB!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is full of hackers and neither STEAM or Infinity Ward is doing anything about it, the servers are empty. Then they want you to pay full price for the map packs, LMAO! Whatever! Lower the Map Pack to a $Dollar$ ... maybe we can get some honest players back."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont Buy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Team Fortress 2 is better...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD ever. They've killed the game ...  No graphical improvements. No game improvements. Nothing but a re-skin and re-story. Pretty sure they owe the COD fan's a new engine by now!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can I have a refund?  No, suriously!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I think the reason that they called it â€˜Ghostsâ€™ is because they have killed the franchise.  Infinity Ward was doing well with the MW series, the campaign was fun to play and the spec-ops missions in MW2 and MW3 were quite addictive and made me want to chase those 3 star ratings. Multiplayer also had me hooked, and even with some niggling complaints from some of the previous games (such as quickscoping), they were still enjoyable and soaked up untold hours of my life.  After the launch of MW3, Infinity Wardâ€™s Creative Strategist resigned, the following year Ghosts emerged.  Like a lot of other people, I was also led into a false sense of security and invested good money on this game. Only to find out that it would not even be worth the money at a quarter of the price. And instead of fixing al of the bugs, unbalanced multiplayer, ridiculous perks and booting hackers, they would much rather release $130 worth of DLC (to date).  The only positive thing that I can say about this game is that Alt+F4 still works.â€¦.. No more COD games for me, Iâ€™m now put off the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't make this review anymore simple, don't buy it. This game has made me wise not to buy games off steam,rather buy the disk so if I don't like the game I can sell it, now I'm stuck with this crap.  Added to review:  Graphics Quality: I've upgraded my PC, i5 Quad Core, nVidia GeForce 750Ti, etc etc, not top of the PC's but I can play any game on full quality settings ( yes, nVidia GeForce Experience sets optimal settings as lower than full, but I bumped it up ), I spent a day downloading the game from steamn, logged in, set all settings to full, logged in to private server to play by myself ( monitor on FULL HD ). What a dissapointment! It's like playing IGI, absolutly NO detail in the textures. I think they've added some water reflection and hoped it tricks everyone.  Playability: You pay for this game, then when you log in, you are expected to pay for more and more. Yes you can log in and start playing for free, but you can't play the full game. The moment you log in you have pop ups asking if you want to buy this add on or that extra, etc, you'd think the game was infected with Malware.  I've wasted enough time and money on this game, I'm not even interested in the new one coming out. I play Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon : Phantoms now, Free to Play and so much better.  Just don't waste your time and money on this piece of trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game ever and i pay for this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didn't really care for this Call of Duty at all. The guns don't really have much character to them, and I really dislike the point system used to unlock things for multiplayer. The campaign was alright."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is unfinished. There are A LOT of glitches and bugs. The MP spawns are broken, the dog kill streak is teleporting, there are tons of hackers and ubalanced weapons. Infinity ward tried to revamp the cod series into a Next-gen series but failed at it. they now even charge money on a skin, FOR YOUR DOG!!! Infinity took one step forward and took a few steps backwards."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crap Maps, Crap Game Play. This is the reason I did not buy the Battlefield series..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just another garbage game from Infinity Ward.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wont buy any call of duty games again , because all the games are same for me and nothing new , and even more bugs and crashes , i just tried to get support from them but I got nothing ...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Totally waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Full of hackers, noobs crying all the time, and a bunch of bugs make this game the worst game on COD franchise, stay out and dont do the same mistake that i did, save your money and buy some real good game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a die hard fan for Call of Duty since the beginning.  I am truly dissapointed with what has become of the series.  Sadly, I won't support any more of Infinity wards games.   Not reccomended."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Massive amounts of cheaters. Now that the game is stable and playing good, they need to get the cheaters out. The game isn't worth 2 pennies right now because of that. Maybe they will do something someday, but save your money of BF4 or something else until they get off their asses and do something about it. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no worth for 59.99usd..this game is sucks...multiplayer no much people join...fail...i from asia and i always cannot get people in multiplayer...i hope you do something at multiplayer...or this will be my last game in cod game series...sucks..wasting my time just to wait people in game..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was looking forward to this game. Coming off of (what i thought) was fantastic multiplayer in Blops2 i expected IW to build on the great multiplayer model created by Treyarch. I have never been more wrong about anything in my life.  This game is an insult to pc gaming. Terrible FPS drops for no reason, rediculous system requirements for a game that looks worse than its predecessors, all around bad optimization. It almost seems as though IW hates Treyarch because they completely threw out the Blops2 multiplayer model.   The gameplay is essentially what you would expect from any IW CoD game, except with added lag and frustration. IW seems to have tried to make the game playable with 1 or 2 patches, but its too little too late. The game has literally no player base on steam anymore. The game launched with the promise of dedicated servers, which were never implemented, but at least we got additional dog fur textures, fish AI and PERFECT CIRCLES on our scopes!  The single player is fun for what it is. If you played any CoD campaign you've played Ghosts. Story is weak at best, but still fun. Dog mechanic is interesting and unfortunately only used once or twice. The single player runs just as badly as the multiplayer, but seems to look slightly better. The levels are diverse some being fun and memorable.   Extinction mode however is fun. Its essentially zombies from Blops, but with aliens, and more objectives.  If this game ran properly and cost $15 it would be a game you could buy and not hate yourself for. Currently the game isnt worth buying, even for the single player/extinction mode. Even if IW were to fix the issues with the game the playerbase is no longer there.   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To begin, I'd like to say that I have FULLY supported the Call of Duty franchise up to this year. Upon buying Ghosts, I felt like a complete idiot for purchasing such a terrible game that was very unoptimized.   Gameplay+Campaign: 6/10 The Gameplay of this game is obviously the same as all the other titles aside from the fact that we get sliding, new arm motiong, hurtling, etc. The Gameplay is nothing 'game-changing' and the Campaign is fairly decent. It sets you off in a near-future, crippled America and you *SURPRISE, SURPRISE* are a part of the military. You go to ridiculous ends to stop one man who practically has South America by the balls (Also reminescent of Black Ops 2). Campaign is nothing memorable and you play as a mute. You never talk the whole game EVER...  Graphics: 1/10 The reason I give this an incredibly low score is due to the fact that even the most power hungry, beastly PCs, cannot run this game better than Battlefield 4. The game looks the same as MW3 but this game is horribly optimized to the point where I cannot run this game adeptly on my gaming rig... (Which CAN run Battlefield 4 on Ultra)   Levelution: 1/10 Levelution! The best part of modern FPS titles! WRONG The game just epically failed in this attempt to woo me over to buy the game. Here is a list of the WORST ideas possible: The logs roll down the hill and kill whoever is in the area! The Gas Station blows up and falls over providing cover and killing NOBODY! A tree falls down and something happens to a wall :/ Overall nothing that major, this game is WEAK compared to (dare I say it again?!) Battlefield 4!  Multiplayer: .00001/10 Don't get me started! The multiplayer has reskinned (and even brought back) the same guns from MW3! No matter how much someone wishes to defend this point, the guns have the same characteristics and even share the same stats as previous guns. The servers are laggy, only 3,000 people online, and stuttering due to poor optimization.  Overall: 3/10 You already know the result, same game every year, so why do we buy it?! DO NOT buy this title, give 60$ to indie developers or a game like Binding of Isaac who really was creative and took YEARS to come out with a new game , not one or two! This game is a waste of money when you simmer it down, the lack of enthusiasm on this title should have warned me. DO NOT even get this on console, I forewarn you, it's poo, don't buy it and Steam, please remove this game, nobody is playing it anyway and the majority of people who are, are hackers :)     "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Plays badly, poor optimization and full of hackers. COD never again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Servers are laggy, to many hackers with no way to get rid of them, no dedicated ranked servers. This game is an epic failure!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice graphics, well though of multiplayer gaming. Sadly, not much is done towards anti-cheats as hackers are rampant and not put in their place quickly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hackers EVERYWHERE! DOnt waste your money. Infinity Ward is so lazy to implement an Anti-Cheat system on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a hackers game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lacks basic required in game options for any PC based FPS. Notably no FOV slider and only a SINGLE GLOBAL audio slider. Lacks any optimisation for PC as well. Plays like crap even on good gaming PCs. Spawns are terrible. Like REALLY TERRIBLE. While there has been some improvements to the spawn system, and I have not gotten spawn trapped in FFA recently, they're still pretty bad. Maps are large, confusing and not what we meant when we as a community asked for 'larger maps' why not just build 5 or 7 lane maps, we didn't want or need 27+ random â™¥â™¥â™¥ mess lanes. Very few players as Activision and IW have largely ignored the PC community and their cries to fix the game. I can go on but I feel it isn't neccesary."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First off I played this game on the Xbox One and enjoy the heck out of the story line, they brought back the old MW engine rather the broken Blackops engine which seem like a good chose. But for me I'm not a real FPS shoot for console if I want a good FPS match I have play on PC so I pick this up on sales... Man let me just say what a bad doing, not only am I feed up with people saying â€œOh get a better mouseâ€ cause my Corsair M65 buggy. My mouse seems to want do 360 flips randomly even though it works in every other game like normal mouse. The game has options which really do nothing example 'Smooth Mouse' it does nothing on or off... Another is free look this disable only allows you move left to right WHY WHY have this as a option?  I enjoy heck out of all other COD but this is my last. If I didn't buy this off Gamefly I would use my ONE and only return with valve.  Single player works perfect &gt; My Corsair M65 is 'A bad Mouse' asking Ghost community &gt; (Mouse sensitivity is broken) Multiplayer seem broken &gt; I understand player host not server work perfect in old games not this one... Graphics are okay for FPS &gt; Half-life 2 seem better even before new update.  That is why I wouldn't recommend this game, but if you get over graphics and mouse part and you enjoy last OLD MW this is just like it with new features. The Dog is very bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Like all of the other call of duty's past WoW, the game has been recycled with similar animations,mechanics and storyline."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Waste of money , don't buy it! End of."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is bad for all the same reasons all the other CoD games are bad, with the annual addition of things that make these games progressivley worse. Save your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Camping Simulator 2013. Worst CoD ever, you can't see enemies and EVERY SINGLE killstreak is made to push you into camping.  1/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst Game ever, just a money spinner now turned pay to win, laggy as F**k too, played every one and stopping at black ops 2, horrid series"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cookie Clikers is worth more of your time
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I thought it would be better than it actually is, Im a COD Veteran and so far nothing can live up to MW2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always been a fan of call of duty, even among a group of friends that hate the franchise. For some reason I can't stop buying. Well, now maybe I can. Not only are this game's graphics, gameplay, gunplay, and lighting completely dissfuntional, but the game just isn't interesting in any way. They didn't really add anything significant since previous games and they left so very much to be desired. CoD 4 through Black Ops were all amazing, but I absolutley hated MW3 and Black Ops 2. However, these games were still able to hold my interest. Ghosts does not in any way, shape, or form hold my interest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thought it would be alright for $15. What a rip. Super buggy - what FPS have you played where scopes actually glitch and become useless? Hit detection and lag issues are many times worse than the initial problems plaguing BF4 when it launched. Those are just the most glaring issues.  Graphically, it's rather disgusting. I assumed that everything had defaulted to Low settings for some reason, but upon inspection, it was all set to High. It basically looks like Duke Nukem Forever and plays like Quake 3 Arena.  The whole game is generally a mess; it's split up into three different parts: Single Player, Competitive Multiplayer, and Co-Op Extinction. It doesn't even feel like one unified product which is very strange.  Single player features the typical Call Of Duty style large set pieces void of any interactivity and instead of letting you explore these environments, you are hurried to the next whatever to shoot more stuff. In some cases if you hang back to explore, you automatically fail the mission. Even the objectives you are pushed around to are unclear and not interesting except for bringing you closer to the next loading screen cutscene and towards the end of the game. I played for a few hours and decided it was just too dumb to waste my time with.  Multiplayer is pretty much Team Deathmatch since the majority of players (less than 400) were playing this. Due to the lack of dedicated servers, you have no control over what game you are entering. This sucks so hard. The time to kill for pretty much every weapon is super fast and due to lag, things can get really weird. Dying after running behind a wall, or getting killed before even hearing the multiple shots that took you out. It's gross. Watching the deathcam replays even shows in slow motion how janky the hit detection is - it is pretty damn funny.  Extinction has crashed every time I tried to play it, so maybe I'm missing out on why this game deserves more than $5?    If you are into early-access alpha versions of games, you might like this. Otherwise, save your cash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I want to like this game. I really do. I enjoy it for the cocaine-like stimulation of fast paced run and gun, knowing maps well enough to use tactical positioning to outwit your opponents and memorize gameplay patterns, etc. I basically want to turn off my brain and use muscle memory and let all the endorphins in my skull release at once. And you'll get a bit of that. But you'll die often if you play that way, and that gets annoying--and for two major flaws with the game that ended up being a dealbreaker for me.  CONS:  The maps. Camping is the best way to succeed at this game, and that's what most people do. Maybe because the levels are too big, maybe because they are too open or are missing some magic rule of thirds--the fact remains that they are poorly designed for run and gun style gameplay and trying to play that way you will die often and it will be frustrating. Whereas camping is also annoying because most of what you're doing is waiting. Your best chance is really to stay in a high traffic area with a lot of corners and watch your map like a hawk, relying on direct combat--but that is even more frustrating than the levels.  Lag. Oh my god, the lag. I've heard a few theories. That the Ghosts multiplayer server is based in Russia, and slow, or that people hack the game and force you to lag out when near, I honestly have no idea. But I would say a conservative of estimate is that a third of my deaths are utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. 'I should've killed that guy' is a phrase you'll come to know well, whether from little things like putting a couple extra bullets into someone and them then turning and killing you in a single shot, or to big things like the game stalling and your opponent magically jumping from ten feet away to right in front of you and knifing you. Maybe 1/15 (trying to be realistic) games you play will drop from bad connection. At least 1/5 have major hiccups, shaking your around the map or having to connect to a new host, and almost every game will have some noticeable connection issue...unfortunately usually the ones that leave you saying 'wtf i should not be dead right now.'  Also dogs. God I hate the dogs in this game. They take three times as much damage to kill and will leap from fifteen feet away and you will die when they are five feet away in midair. Basically if you see one and don't have a shotgun and time to volley out four shots you are dead. But I digress.  Lastly I mean I might as well mention it but the campaign is just utterly stupid. All holds barred I haven't actually finished it or even really made it past maybe the fifth chapter or whatever. But the way it plays I feel like I am at Dave and Busters playing House of the Dead or one of those foot pedal games where you have to save the president's daughter or whatever. They really make an effort to make the cinematic moments epic... buildings falling in front of you, giant explosions in space, etc. but the gameplay is mind numbingly stupid.   Last gripe are all the microtransactions and high premium for DLC they expect you to pay, while offering very little cool features and customization in game. It just feels blatantly skeevy and disappointing, but I guess when no one plays this game except the 25 kids who play it 24/7 and dominate each game, it makes sense to try and suck as much money out of it as possible. Maybe the DLC maps are better, but the hell I'm going to pay the price of most other games for each of them just to find out.  PROS:  The most fun I have playing this game is running around with the Bulldog and on some of the smaller levels like Strikezone, Fog, or Tremor. That gun is fun as hell, maybe a little OP but I guess compensates for the lag sometimes.  With graphics turned all the way up the game is admittedly beautiful. I am sort of hesitant to give CoD 4 (which rumor has it is still the best CoD game) a try just because it's not as pretty.   Besides that yeah I will probably uninstall very soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am a CoD Fan but this game 2 bad and im so sad....  PROS: + Gameplay + Graphics + Ability to practice with bots + Nice CooP Story  CONS: - Poor performance - Bugs and crashes - Small, poorly designed maps (all maps sucks...) - Worst spawn points ever in MP... Its Terrible... - There is no anti hack system... Cheaters Everywhere! It just like free to use !??!?!? - FPS Drops... - Poor Weapons in MP... - Worst Kill Streaks ever... - Poor Calling Card system in MP (titles, emblems.. all sucks..) - Have to use Android or IOS Devices for ClanWars - There is no Player profil/stats menÃ¼ in game (Like BO2 ) - Paid map packs   1/10 Just Wasting Money..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I swore off Call of Duty after MW3. I was pretty much done with the genre and I never liked Blops. I had not planned on buying Ghosts but a friend purchased it for me as an XMAS gift shortly after it launched. I am glad I didn't pay any out of pocket for this turd sandwich.  The single player is maybe 4 hours long and your typical shoot anything that moves and run away from those explosions. They put in a dog to have a cheap hit you in the feels moment. Acctually besides the bad guy the dog was the only other memorable character. But anyway I am not gonna rip on this game for it's single player, as nobody cares about Call of Duty for that.  This is the absolute worst multiplayer experience for a Call of Duty game yet. The maps were designed by some rookies, none of them even stood out and really had no kind of structure to them. The respawn points were ADHD, I can't even count how many times I respawned like 10 feet from where I died just to get shot by the same person again, and sometimes even a third time. The solider loadout customization and unlock system was like three steps backwards and royally sucked. Game was a rushed piece of crap, more than likely was outsourced. Don't buy it, don't waste your time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game for 15 bucks during a steam sale. When I first got it, my laptop couldnt even run the game because of its ridiculously unnecesary specs. But now that I am running on a gaming laptop, the game can barely run medium settings at a decent frame rate. On top of this, the servers dont function, and loading screens in multiplayer take forever. This was definitely not a smart buy, even for 15 bucks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If u r ready for the lag, the cheaters, buy this game now!! Can't deny that this game is still outstanding bc it's different."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"do not buy, just dont do it to yourself.... please...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Who designed this store/game tradeoff? When i'm in the game, one of the ONLY reasons i'm opening steam up is to get maps.... WHY IS THERE NO WAY TO GET MAPS ON THE STORE PAGE?!?!???!?!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,gArBaGe waste of money. warez it for sp maybe..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible servers ruining a game that used to be fun
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why does this game even exist it's so broken. I want i money back
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst Call of Duty game of all time. I would rather play Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. The optimization is terrible. A complete waste of $60.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,big fan of MW1 &amp;2 and Black ops 2. pass on this. its the same regurgitated crap as all the rest of them. the only reason why i bought it was because i needed a quick fps fix and origin was down (big surprise amirite?) so i couldn't buy bf4. really poor arcady type gameplay and poor gpu optimization. maybe next year will be better with the new developer. i dunno.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible game multiplayer lag is out of controle loved all the prevous cods out of all of the cods this is by far the worst do yourself a favour use your money wisely and buy blackops 2 and get the dlc youll have a lot more fun and a lot less headache
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game! I want my money back! This is the greatest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t i`ve ever seen! 0ijgfipuhpÃ¼9uhapisdÃ¼hfuoib Ã¼toiug
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Could be better optimized for pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Random VAC bans to a team player lost out on DGL tournament. This game is broken.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great Game but activision does nothing about the hackers. Not much fun playing when the other players have aimbots, wallhacks."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is not worth it.... dont buy it ;-;  3/10 Dinosaur Chicken Nuggets.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wanna waste your money on a game that has nothing different from the other games except a fish AI that fails to other games like Mario? Wanna waste your money on a game that is very bad optimized and you can see the floating models of grass and the poor console textures on ultra quality?  Then this game is for you!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After a week the game is a bore. And the new DLC is just a way to suck as much money as they can outta you and give you dusted off old maps. Come on, where did the imagination go people? I can't believe we can't make a better game than this one. COD is just going downhill. COD World at War was the last game worth the money. Oh and by coinsidence we were able to have servers. What a novel idea."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm disappointed, I bought this game on the promise of a never before seen fish AI it was a lie the fish didn't move. Prove is in link  http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/702854866081203340/152046707D4F495BEDAC041DDD1491861EDFD0E0/ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is only single-player and extinction mode working? Multiplayer starts to load, but ends with a black screen and an error, says, 'FATAL ERROR: common_core_dlc_updated_mp' Same goes with the squad game mode. Oh, and the dlcs don't show up, still says that I have not purchased them, even though I've bought them about a month ago. Don't get this unless you wanna give away your money! By the way, did I mention the graphics? Minecraft has better graphics than this!  If that is not bad enough, the campaign reminds me of a simplified or dumbed down variation of battlefield. I never knew that tanks could instantly start moving forward when you shift forward. Gameplay still feels the same as always, nothing new. All orignal problems are still present. Seriously IW, learn from your mistakes, and don't let history repeat itself.........for like the third or fourth time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crappiest game ever, and i ve been playing cod for years, it just sucks dont buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too many disconnects and hackers..and they do nothing about it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't get this game it's terrible and has terrible support and i didnt even get started on the gameplay.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money on this poor console port.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i waste my money for a not finished game. apparently that's not made for pc. so don't buy it!.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a HEAP OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it comes to survival. They stripped out any logical sense of strategical survival gameplay for something that a hobo version of multiplayer. Enemies can spawn in anywhere, even behind you if your at the foot edge of a waterfall. You start with a pistol in survival? And have to run to a crate to see whats in it to get a new gun? Thats â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Enemies look like holographic popiscle stick animation, all of them are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yellow. I have disputed the sale via Paypal and I am requesting my money back. I've unistalled this poisoned poorly designed heap of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game for PC. It does not work properly and even after trying to apply community-made fixes, it still doesn't perform well. This game was released long ago and Infinity Ward has ignored the PC gaming community completely due to lack of patches and fixes for their broken release. The game is a waste of internet download time, since the game is around 40 GB, but the game itself doesn't look any more grahpically intensive. The FOV is locked at a nauseous 65, though the gaming community has unofficial FOV changers.   In Ghosts Multiplayer, IW tried to copy Black Ops 2 style of weapon loadouts and class editing, but instead made a huge mess with too many split up perks and guns with forced attachments (like a silencer). Customization was thought to be increased with the new player editor, but this game has far less customization than before. Each Soldier can only carry six different loadouts and you can't customize them much more than their skin color until you play Multiplayer and complete certain objectives to gain clothing. You are only able to change the soldier's outfit as a whole, except for the headpiece. There are no more custom emblem editors in the game, you now have to use premade patches created by IW.   Multiplayer itself could have been a fun experience, but I wouldn't be able to tell you since the game is broken and not playable for me. Multiplayer is locked at 91 FPS while I have a 144hz screen and a more than capable GPU of running this game. As of 12/21/2013 I have only put around 30 hours into this game and have uninstalled it due to it wasting space on my hard drive.   Avoid this game.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a CoD fan (not that Treyarch stuff) since CoD2, which had better graphics at times than this latest release. Sadly after CoD4 it seems that this franchise has started to die off, but I don't mean that their games don't sell - They do.   What I mean is that from a gamers perspective, each game seems to be getting worse as they get pushed out. This is the first CoD title I have bought on my PC as I originally played on Xbox. I feel that, most developers these days seem to be under the impression we want a high tech. loadout system. I'm not saying that the loadouts are a bad idea, however, what happened to the sdays when everyone spawned with the same weapon and it became more about controlling key areas and weapon respawn points than someone being rank 60 with every perk/attachment on their gun going up against someone significantly lower? This is the case for most games these days, as every FPS uses this system now.  In regards to this game specifically, it will be the last CoD title I buy at this point. The campaign has it's merits, though copied cutscenes from previous games probably aren't the best idea, but I managed to complete it on VETERAN in a matter of 5.6 hours. CoD 2 I may have finished on Veteran in 5.6 days... It wasn't a challenge at all - simplified for the kids, made easier, is this what games have become?  Multiplayer - On Steam, launch day had 24k players online... Peak now is 10k (and these figures aren't exactly amazing), off peak you're looking at roughly 3k-5k. I noticed some of the cut corners in certain maps, square wheels for example. It hasn't been polished at all. Maybe the Xbox version is different in some respects, but from a PC POV it's not great.  Ultimately my Not Recommended comes from the rinse and repeat effect most AAA titles have these days, gaming is just not what it used to be - Maybe I'm just getting old :3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC version is horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Need to change the Direct X 11 only crap itspissing me really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing off and i know a lot of others are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it aswell
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Easiest campaign of all COD time... 7 hours playthrough on veteran?!!??!!?!?!? WTF.......
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't waste your money. Spend it on BF4, instead, trust me..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a good game, but dissapointing in the way that it is probably the worst COD to date. There are some serious issues that need to be fixed, patched, and gotten rid of. Infinity Ward certainly must of known of these issues, yet they show a lack of responsibility by letting them slide, and now all COD players have to suffer. I hope you sleep well at night Infinity Ward, because it won't last long. -_-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player game looks good and runs well and is generally fun. The multiplayer mode is unplayable, in my opinion, because the lag is so high, you cannot register hits properly, its pray and spray. I would say they need to upgrade their servers to reduce latency, but it is my understanding that there are no servers at all, just peer to peer connections and a 800 ms (!!) allowable ping hardwired in. Also, as far as I know, there is no way to check pings in game, perhaps a method used to not call attention to the huge problem. An MMO is difficult to play with 300+ ms pings to other players or servers, a FPS is far more ping and lag dependent, and this is completely unnacceptable. Oddly enough, black ops 2 multiplayer runs fine online, with little to know lag, so those thinking about purchasing this game would be better served to buy the less expensive and overall better quality black ops 2 game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"just for the 6GB RAM Limitation even if it has been fixed now this game sucks, I had to buy RAM to play this and then they just changed the RAM Requirements to 4GB!! Nice of them to make me waste my money and on top of that the game has other issues also(check online) !!! Thank God I was wise enough to just buy the normal version of the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I loved Call of Duty series till Call of Duty Black Ops II.  Probably they can't find any more interesting stories. Worse than that, maybe they don't even try to find one.  Game play is just like playing the old Call of Duty game missions with the old same graphics. Even the things that you do in the missions are the pretty same.  Multiplayer is full of cheaters and I don't think they even get banned.  Maybe Activision should start to care about its customers' thoughts more than sucking money..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is for the multiplayer as I don't buy the game for a short single player. The people who play the game make it bad for the most part. The game is lacking a few features like a FOV slider, a FPS counter, a server browser, something that shows ping, ect. The maps are way to big, unfortunatly the developers don't care to listen to the community, it's clear people like fast paced gameplay yet the devolpers put in big slow paced maps. I think snipers and shotguns need there own game mode because you cannot make two weapons realistic and the rest of the guns unrealistic. There is also a lack of people playing it so you only have a few game mode choices (Team Death Match and Domination the rest have very few people playing them). Compared to other recent Call of Duties it take a lot longer to level up which is not good in my opinon. The leaderboards are hacked already and I would not be suprised if they never got fixed. I have only ran into 1 hacker so far with around 25 hours on the game. IEDS need to be nerfed or there needs to be a way to avoid them besides using a certain perk. I hear a lot about this game being badly optimized but I get very little lag with a FX-8350 and a GTX 660. The game is locked at 91 FPS so 120hz monitors are useless. I liked the older way of class set ups (Cods before Black Ops 2). This prestige system is not good in my opinion either, there was nothing wrong with the old prestige system. Most of the presige icons are plain and not very well thought out. I will admit the game can be fun at times if you don't take it seriously which I highly reccomend you don't as you will just get mad. This game honestly does not feel fresh like a new Call of Duty game should. I do not reccomend buying this game unless the price tag was cheaper."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"An utter disgrace to the PC and Call of Duty community. Previous to Call of Duty: Ghosts, I was a huge fan of the Call of Duty series. Black Ops 2 was, in my opinion, the best Call of Duty in a long time. I was excited to see how Infinity Ward would raise the bar even higher. Not only did Infinity Ward not raise the bar, they completely tripped and slammed their head against it like that poor disabled boy you felt sorry for in primary school. At first glance during the weeks until release, the game looked promising, but I soon discovered otherwise after installing the game, which took over an hour to do, over 4 physical discs, and 60GBs of my precious hard drive space. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a poorly optimised utter piece of garbage. It shouldn't even be classified as a game. The game suffers from constant FPS drops and stutter, even at low graphics settings. I bumped the graphics as high as possible, regardless of FPS, to see how the game looked at it's best. Even at the highest graphics settings, this game looks like someone had used shutterstock images ripped straight from Google Images. Due to the fact that I was using an SLI configuration for my PC, the game decided that it should constantly annoy me by flickering many essential textures, such as the sights on my gun. After complaining about this issue to activision support, they informed me that they would release a patch shortly, which never happened. Whether or not that issue has been fixed at the time of writing this review, I wouldn't know, as I even refuse to update a game this poor in quality. Another fun fact about the patches is that they take up even MORE space, and barely fix anything. Infinity Ward didn't even bother putting a simple feature like a field of view changer, which is essential for PC gamers. The only way to change the FOV is to download an unofficial mod, which Infinity Ward will ban you for using. Even when disregarding the technical issues with this game, it is still a terrible game. Campaign is stale and boring, and multiplayer on the PC version only has an average of 2000 players, most of which camp in corners and use IEDs instead of their guns. Extinction mode isn't bad, but gets boring really fast. I even spotted an Xbox One button icon in one of the menus whilst playing Extinction mode, which is proof that Infinity Ward never even bothered to make a decent port of the game. All they did was make the Xbox One version of the game playable with a mouse and keyboard.  In closing, Infinity Ward and Activision have slapped together THE WORST CALL OF DUTY GAME EVER KNOWN TO MAN, charged their customers large amounts of money for a product equivelant to that of the matter that falls out from a dog's behind, and overhyped the innocent Call of Duty community with promises that they couldn't even keep, such as dedicated servers, HD graphics and ongoing support.  If you are a Call of Duty fan, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Instead, wait for Treyarch (the one true Call of Duty developer) to clean up Infinity Ward's mess when they release their next Call of Duty title.  THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY I HAVE EVER SPENT"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It soes not play has smoothly Mw3, for example my play in ghost is poor but in mw3 is far better, enemes seem to appear out of nowhere. When I try to follow a bad guy with my weapon it seems to jerk cuseing me to loose the kill. Black ops is the same. I wish all your games ran like MW3."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Since i get this game i was waiting to download.. It take just 2 or 4 hour. Loaded and then a message pop up and said: DirectX uncoverable error. How can i fix this even i have good graphic card and my DirectX is updated and version 11.If you have this message youll gonna get mad cause youre 60$ is in the trash. So as what i say i didnt even played the game. And the guys who made cod:ghosts dont even made a solution or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

Jump lobbies with the same 10 players with a game never starting, just cycling over and over. Other than that, great."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well unfortunately I wasted $120 on the Hardened version of Ghosts. I had high hopes because I truly loved the Modern Warfare games. This game is inconsistant, very choppy, and I am not a big fan of 'Squad Points' It seems as if there is not a very fair playing field either. My kills and deaths are a complete opposite from the other IW games. Quite embarrassing actually. The campaign, on the other hand, was very entertaining! That said, the campaign totally wasn't worth $120. I have a long time to wait until they put out another game, lets hope it is worth it. I won't be paying for Hardened next time that is for damn sure. Also every time a new set of maps come out the lag is so damn bad it isn't even worth playing...VERY frustrating!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I beleive that this will still become the best cod game to date. Infinity ward has just not shown us the resolove to fix the games faults yet they have been addressing the wrong bug instead of making this game smoother to play 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First off I played this game on the Xbox One and enjoy the heck out of the story line, they brought back the old MW engine rather the broken Blackops engine which seem like a good chose. But for me I'm not a real FPS shoot for console if I want a good FPS match I have play on PC so I pick this up on sales... Man let me just say what a bad doing, not only am I feed up with people saying â€œOh get a better mouseâ€ cause my Corsair M65 buggy. My mouse seems to want do 360 flips randomly even though it works in every other game like normal mouse. The game has options which really do nothing example 'Smooth Mouse' it does nothing on or off... Another is free look this disable only allows you move left to right WHY WHY have this as a option?  I enjoy heck out of all other COD but this is my last. If I didn't buy this off Gamefly I would use my ONE and only return with valve.  Single player works perfect &gt; My Corsair M65 is 'A bad Mouse' asking Ghost community &gt; (Mouse sensitivity is broken) Multiplayer seem broken &gt; I understand player host not server work perfect in old games not this one... Graphics are okay for FPS &gt; Half-life 2 seem better even before new update.  That is why I wouldn't recommend this game, but if you get over graphics and mouse part and you enjoy last OLD MW this is just like it with new features. The Dog is very bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is bad for all the same reasons all the other CoD games are bad, with the annual addition of things that make these games progressivley worse. Save your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game but i cant recomend it because needs a performance patch,should be added to ghosts FOV and an option to get more FPS like blackops2 has!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Wish I Could Refund My Money!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD game made for pc ever. Not optimized.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty..... Once a prestigious title among PC gaming now a shunned family member that brings embarrassment to FPS gaming. Instead of focusing on the game play itself and tuning the game to work well the developers seem to have attempted to throw as many perks and add-ons for weapons as they can even to the point that one of the kill streak rewards the 'oracle' is basically an in game wall hack.   The series has really fallen from its start where skills would be determined on using the actual gun to get kills but it seems the game is just a psycho massacre simulator for people these days with all you need is to get a few kills to activate a kill streak that doubles your score or once you achieve some of the higher level kill streaks you can become nearly invincible with a knife for a weapon.  It all seems pointless to me with a huge lack of community building that the game was so loved for, vCoD through to Modern warfare where people would host servers for their clans or general playgrounds and you would actually be able to make friends in the game and continue to discuss matters and have fun through the forums for these clans or playgrounds, building fun and enjoyable communities through the game where as today everything is automatically matched up the game will last 4 or so rounds and then you end up in another game with different people mostly filled by trolls, whiny kids and hackers.  With the lack of game play being based on the player actually having to aim their gun and the opportunity of building fun and exciting communities the game is a real let down since the end of the first modern warfare it really has just been one massive downhill disappointment.  2/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"enjoyed all the codz .. enjoyed thissin.. but the campaign is extreamly short... 6 hours for me, compaired to the 20+ hours it took for each of the last two releases. then theres the runnin down a hallway fealing i was getting.... even in space... i give it a 7/10... i did enjoy it.. but its not a $50 game. not for the multiplayer, witch is kinda broken from what i hear. soo.. not recommended, to spendy for what your gettin.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sucks the big fat one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you think Mw3 was a horrible game, and you're about to buy this one too, think again! Ghosts is even worse. Why? Audio from 2001 Graphics look worse than BO1/2 Tunnelvision FOV (60?) and no FOV slider to fix this. Horrible FPS stutters (coming from a high-end rig), makes it seem like a straight console port.  If you haven't bought Black Ops 1/2 yet, i'd recommend those!    "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Laggy af and crashes often. Bad news.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thats all i have to say
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game for the campaign and was not dissappointed. The story is pretty thrilling, the characters are good and the levels are REALLY exiting. The multiplayer, however, is near the worst in the series. The maps are too big for the amount of players, the levels are cluttered, there's WAY too much customisation (especially kill streaks) and it just turns into an incredibly uneventful experience. They are trying to step up to Battlefield, but failing miserably. If you want a solid Call of Duty campaign with fairly awesome graphics, this is your game, if you want a good multiplayer game, I stress DO NOT BUY THIS. And, if you are to buy this, get it on sale, it's not worth anything about 50 dollars. Let's hope Sledgehammer step things up allot with their Call of Duty, I'm feeling hopeful."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't understand why i keep buying these...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD ever made.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful PC Port, I made it half-way through the game on the lowest settings with a pair of Sapphire 5870â€™s while only crashing a few times. Once I made it to the underwater level the game would crash to desktop with a DirectX error at the exact same point every time right before the mission ended.   Then I bought a Sapphire R9 290X (4 GB card) and tried to play the level againâ€¦guess what happenedâ€¦..I made it 15 seconds farther without crashing!!!!!! How great is that!  No excuse to not be able to run ANY game on a 4GB card on the LOWEST settings. Donâ€™t buy the game, because it literally doesnâ€™t work.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Might Just neck myself right now
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I think that you should not buy this game it is a wast of $60 I got it on sale for $12. I say this because the story is good but it doese not makeup for the amount of crashes consantly I can not belive that this company expects peaople to pay $60 on a game that constantly crashes. The game isint all that bad but the crashes gets realy anoying. You can chrash mid game and lose all the XP its realy anoying. Oh yea did I metion that the game is 40 GB of storage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No, don't ever buy the game.  I don't care if you accept this review or not, I just don't recommend. No, I pre-ordered it.  The campaign is just mostly about shooting people and only a few parts actually interest me (Free Fall for example). I'd like to see stealth parts (no, don't even mention that jungle escape).  The multiplayer is just average."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD game by far to date! THIS is the nail in the coffin for COD PC gaming, all I can say is, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not worth the money you will be happier off playing Modern Warfare 3 because it looks that same, plays the same, and even runs the same. Black Ops 2 Is a year older than this but yet black ops 2 runs better than this. This game feels like it was just thrown together and brought out befor it was finished.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Passing by to give a review. So here goes!  The multiplayer is very unbalanced in regards to guns,perks,killstreaks.   So let's start with the pros  + Amazing sound  + Great graphics  + Decent weapon choices  Cons  - Runs on P2P (Peer to peer networking) Some users will abuse this system to their advantage by lagging other clients to gain an advantage to themselves . (Lag switching)  - Bad optimization for the PC version.  - FPS cap at 91 FPS. I hit that and it still lags. (V-sync enabled)   - Mutliplayer is dull. ( Boring killstreaks and game modes)  - Colours are unpleasant  Conclusion: Don't buy this game, it's not worth Â£ 39.99. However if you still want to try it out, grab it from Amazon for a fiver.  3 / 10  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible support to allow people to actually play online.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth it. CoD sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY!!!!! Worst Purchase ever. Where to begin? This game is unplayable not only because of the lag, framerate drop and other numerous bugs but eveyone has reverted to camping every corner! this game is a waste to the specs. The gfx are so not next gen but last gen. i have purchased games for five dollars that are better than this 60 dollar pos. Again DO NOT BUY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not reccomend this game it is fun and goes fast on my computer but the gameply is horrible  things that they deleted from cod black ops -hit indicator - half the weapons -machetes - a good story  This game was great until after the space level so you get about 10 minutes of good gameplay  I do not recommend this game dont be like me and disregard the reveiws do NOT buy this game waste of money  P.S. for multiplayer there are way too many hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have played every single cod game since the start.this is by FAR the worst one.we were lied to.no new engine.no dedicated servers. The pc version of the game runs fine in single player but the multiplayer part is horribly optimised even on my core i7 2 x 7970. the game menus lag,the first 2o seconds of every game it stutters and skips.the devs are saying it is our computers and are not even accpeting that the game is the issue.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Would not waste my money, so many bugs still in the game ..... Disappointing that a lot of the older bugs from previous versions are apparent in the new version even though the developers know they exist.  Spend most of the time trying to get into a game with friends or sorting out gamming issues and waiting for patches instead of actual quality gaming time.  So many crashes, performance issues, bugs etc... not to mention after all these years we still have the old issue about dedicated servers etc..  You can't use Steam overlay, Steam Friends, Fraps, Teamspeak (Overlay) or a variety of different other software in the background without the game having a issues or problem in one way or another.  I have been a long time supporter of this game over the years, however not any more. (might as well go back to battlefield)  The lack of support or enthusiasm to fix these issues or resolve these problems by the developer is appalling as the game has been out for quite a while and still we have the same problems and quality issues as when it was first released.  How long do we have to wait for the basic problems to be resolved?  Reviewed from a PC gamer not a console player!    "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,badly optimized for pc get on console
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game would be okay if it wern't for the system requirements and the crazy lag ALWAYS. Overall, multiplayer in my opinion is way better than campaign. Not going to give up on this game... yet."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To many hackers and lack of community support, a broken report system and instead of fixing the issues with the game, they keep releasing dlcs tryign to get more money off this broken game! Horrible!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy AF, new cod looks like Gi Joe"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is a $50 paperweight  The game on other platforms is just short of being a $50 paperweight, thereâ€™s still a lot of bugs and it seems the makers of the game only care about the media, counting that the past 5 updates have had to do with pro players and the app, alongside in-game skins for money. You would think after gaining a lot of money from the in-game add-ons, the makers would spend that money to making and fixing the broken game.  Now, for the campaign...the story was trash, I beat campaign on the hardest difficulty in 4 hours, also the campaign played with as many bugs as there are in an ant farm. Finally but not last, due to all the bugs, lag, glitches, in-game flaws, and all around problems we get to online. After you set all of your setting to as low as possible and your game looks like youâ€™re playing on a 90s TV with screen tarring and lag so bad if you jump while standing still, your character to other players looks like your hovering. A point system to level your character, is provide for you, this includes points thatâ€™s seem to be given but thatâ€™s a bug, and enough points that by prestige 5 youâ€™ll have enough to get 1 gun. Lastly if youâ€™re feeling a mod will fix your in game problems, from my experience your rightâ€¦. the in game problems can be fixed with a mod, but sadly after 2 days of playing with a mod fixing the game and making it playable VAC will ban you as I found out today.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,cod is dead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is just the same as the others.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very good game, but the only thing bad is that no one takes responsability for the gaming comunity when it comes to the cheating. We pay a lot of money to have a fair and fun game and so far is the same story over and over, before a game is released there is a release in multiple cheats that destroys the game and makes it feel as it the game creators dont care at all in catching these people and worst they get away with it for multiple version of the game. Besides that I keep getting a lag everytime I start the game no matter on what resolution is the same feeling of a strange lag my PC is more than good enough to handle this game on max setting so Im not sure what the problem is... ASUS GJ73 laptop latest drivers.. Sincerly If I dont see an improvement on this game son I might have to end this long relation of mine with the game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST GAME OF ALL TIME, ONLY BUY TO LAUGH. KTHNX."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is optimized for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. dont buy until it gets patched.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"2.4 KD, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. Hackers, laggs !! Infinity Ward like. Im going to continue playing Treyarch Games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really, really wish I could like this game but, its so laggy for me and multiplayer won't even launch. :?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"just for the 6GB RAM Limitation even if it has been fixed now this game sucks, I had to buy RAM to play this and then they just changed the RAM Requirements to 4GB!! Nice of them to make me waste my money and on top of that the game has other issues also(check online) !!! Thank God I was wise enough to just buy the normal version of the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is a good game, but dissapointing in the way that it is probably the worst COD to date. There are some serious issues that need to be fixed, patched, and gotten rid of. Infinity Ward certainly must of known of these issues, yet they show a lack of responsibility by letting them slide, and now all COD players have to suffer. I hope you sleep well at night Infinity Ward, because it won't last long. -_-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a CoD fan (not that Treyarch stuff) since CoD2, which had better graphics at times than this latest release. Sadly after CoD4 it seems that this franchise has started to die off, but I don't mean that their games don't sell - They do.   What I mean is that from a gamers perspective, each game seems to be getting worse as they get pushed out. This is the first CoD title I have bought on my PC as I originally played on Xbox. I feel that, most developers these days seem to be under the impression we want a high tech. loadout system. I'm not saying that the loadouts are a bad idea, however, what happened to the sdays when everyone spawned with the same weapon and it became more about controlling key areas and weapon respawn points than someone being rank 60 with every perk/attachment on their gun going up against someone significantly lower? This is the case for most games these days, as every FPS uses this system now.  In regards to this game specifically, it will be the last CoD title I buy at this point. The campaign has it's merits, though copied cutscenes from previous games probably aren't the best idea, but I managed to complete it on VETERAN in a matter of 5.6 hours. CoD 2 I may have finished on Veteran in 5.6 days... It wasn't a challenge at all - simplified for the kids, made easier, is this what games have become?  Multiplayer - On Steam, launch day had 24k players online... Peak now is 10k (and these figures aren't exactly amazing), off peak you're looking at roughly 3k-5k. I noticed some of the cut corners in certain maps, square wheels for example. It hasn't been polished at all. Maybe the Xbox version is different in some respects, but from a PC POV it's not great.  Ultimately my Not Recommended comes from the rinse and repeat effect most AAA titles have these days, gaming is just not what it used to be - Maybe I'm just getting old :3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a dismal excuse for a game. The engine is so unoptimised that it runs poorly on dual 7950s, no FOV adjustments so it looks horrible on multi monitor. Further the game is so bloated, needing almost 40GB for a game with such bland textures and crappy AI is a joke, further, the 6GB RAM requirement is insane for this game (though I have 16GB) This is the same engine it was 5 years ago, with a few tweaks, there is no reason for it to be so unoptimised. The jittery framerates, and poor FOV has made it hard for me to play much of it, but what I have played is so bland and basic that I really am not interested in playing more. COD had its time in the sun... 7 years ago, now it is just rehashed garbage that seems to be declining in quality with every release. Will never purchase again. Hell I should have been smart and got a 'trial' of this first before spending my hard earned money on it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS JOKE OF A GAME!!!  Now that I have finished the game. I stand by my original opinion. The single player feels like it was stiched together from cutting room floor cast offs from previous titles and glued together with a weak story. By this I mean, you are supposed to be playing as a Ghost, a stealthy, covert, deadly force, for 3/4 of the game you aren't even a Ghost, nothing is stealthy nor are you a force to be reckoned with. After you do become a Ghost you are slapped around like a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the missions are all about running and hiding and don't fit with the Ghost story told at the beginning. Further there is far too many resources squandered on the dog, Riley, whom you can control through a computer system (but only when scripted) somehow this huge German Shephard is so stealthy he can crawl right past enemies unseen, he is taken from you on the beach mission and then randomly reappears near the end of the game *spoilers* when you have to carry the poor pup to safety. This part feels like it was tacked on when they realised the game was far too short. (As it was, on hard I finished in 7 hours, this is with all the dying I was doing due to the sudden and random frame drops, had I not had to redo so many sections I am confident I could have finished in under 6 hours) Even without Riley on screen if you've turned the dog effects up, you will have random and sudden framedrops. While playing you are so forced where to go, the game may as well have been on rails. You cannot even choose a path through a fountain, you have to go around it, funnelled down a road where the crappy enemy AI can shoot you. They do not aim, the bullets just magically find you if you are to the remotely in front of the enemy. I had one facing almost totally away from me, only to have him suddenly facing me as I crept closer, I am not saying he turned, or moved to be facing me... he was just suddenly facing me gun up and firing as if he had been the whole time. Rarely do you actually get to make a choice or go off on your own and when you do it is all too brief. Your teammates take priority forcing you out of the way through doors, or pushing you out of cover if they are scripted to be there. But all for not as they couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. Back to the performance issues from my original post, with third party hacks and some doctoring of the game I was able to get a playable (solid) framerate, decent FOV and proper multi monitor support, however I CANNOT use this in multiplayer, so the game is still broken. PC Gamer reports having it run great (100fps) on dual TITANS (single monitor), however, this is stupid for this engine, dual 650's or dual 6850's should run this engine that fast. Dual Titans, 780ti, 290X's etc should run this game well over 100fps solid on nVidia Surround or AMD Eyefinity, dual 7950 should be able to get a solid 60fps. As I said in my original post, this game bites... CoD is all but dead and hopefully it finds its way to the grave soon. I will no longer be purchasing any CoD title (on PC or Consoles) even if this was in the bargin bin I would tell you to steer clear."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,For Russian PC version: - Season Pass is not available; I think It's not good... - Ghost server is not available Your f!cking store is available always? - If Steam Client updated Ghost is crashing + Suck my d!ck deep more!!! Maybe Cheaters get satisfaction faster. - Game server is not available for 200 billions dollars. It's right? :::)))
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"single player works fine,  not got round to finishing it yet.     but like ALOT of peeps out there the MP is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed When ever i try to run it always freezes on the menu screen in a few seconds. IW/atv have not bothered fixeing or addressing the issue . damn shame i cant get a refund  well now finished the SP while it was enjoyable it wasnt as good as the first modern warfare games, heck in 3 was better than this. it also borrowed set pieces from the other COD games theres nothing new. story arc seems to be bit of both blops and specops line mashed up very badly. treyarch are doing things better with blops, IW should stick to a story line that follows exploits of cpt Price (brilliant lunatic who saves the world by setting of a h000ge â™¥â™¥â™¥ bomb)  under water and orbital fight sequences were dull , cod 4 had chernoble, mw2 had no russian, mw3 had soaps death, blop had the prison break, blops 2 had the floating island. even the f***king dog is under used in the game.   and the sequel hinted at the end is gona be even more like blops    one brother is gona get brain washed and other brother is gona die trying to save him      tbh screw this game buy spec ops when its next on sale  mp is still f**ked"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game blows! its terrible. Waste of money and time  the dogs are super gay  Ghosts requires no skill at all        Call of Duty: Ghosts - Multiplayer&nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad stuttering and FPS drops Connection lag Outdated graphics Online allmost dead Extinction&lt;Zombies No co-op missions  Don't waste your money on this crap.It's almost unplayable.Online is almost dead and filled with cheaters in 1 month and when it dies you have no cool co-op MW2/3 missions to play with your friends.Now a funny thing is that if you can run BF4 on max settings and 60 you won't be able to do the same with this game with those graphics from COD4.Besides poor optimization this game also has stuttering(micro FPS drops) which kills the whole action expirience,but you have to worry about that if you're lucky to connect to a good host. And this won't be fixed.There where 3-4 patches to date and they fixed nothing,only lowered the RAM needs to 4gb (maybe IW thought that this will help to sell the game?) and added Physix fur and smoke turbulence which dropping FPS like liquid. So I guess it's time to officially bury IW's CODs on PC. Enjoy earlier cods."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Look, I used to find the Call of Duty franchise to be a decent franchise, mainly due to the good multiplayer. In Call of Duty Ghosts however, the multiplayer is fairly lackluster, with very few people playing. Not to mention, you will be dealing with hackers who aren't regulated (kicked) and be plagued by the constant, and fatal to your game, 'Disk Read Error'. Now, if anything I'd say if Infinity ward would fix the bugs, fix the crashes, and better optimize it for PC, it would be a great game, due to the good campaign (when the game works), and a solid platform to play multiplayer (again, when it works, and doesn't crash). Infinity ward, fix the game, and you'll get a better review."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst $20 bucks I ever spent. It lags heavily for about 2 min at the start of every match.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"poor graphics , lag spikes , full of hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage. Noob friendly as always, if you use a certain gun you're guaranteed a KEM, the only thing fun about this game is extinction and custom games with friends and bots."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.    0/10  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly think buying this game has been the biggest mistake of my life. It has been clear that infinityward has stopped putting effort in to their games, but this is without a doubt the worst cod game, and is probably the downfall of the series.   Do not buy this game and stop supporting infinityward, they put zero effort in to their pc ports.  The only parts of the game that were decent were the missions that they copied and pasted from other call of duty games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i bought this game as i have been playing mw2 up until this point, however i might aswell have stuck with it.. this game is literally just a regurgitation of the past and im not even joking when i say thier are borderline identical scenes from mw2 in this (watch cod ghosts exposed). beyond sqauds and a point system revamp for classes and a couple new weapon attatchements.. i see very little creativity since mw2. having said this i am pleased with the addition of sqauds although i wouldnt recommend it.. to anyone.. ever"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Decent story in Single Player, Multiplayer gets some 'Battlefield' inspired deployables but the gameplay is just as bad as ever. The storyline in Ghosts SP is a bit bland but there are highpoints like the space battle scene. Everybody makes a big thing out of the dog. It's just another drone with fur as far as I'm concerned. In MPl, however, the dog is a menace and an unfair advantage to whomever is currently using him. So make sure you get one!  Graphics are decent but not groundbreaking. It still uses the IW (Havok) engine which is showing its age.   All in all it's not worth the $60 price to anyone but the rabid fans of the franchise. Remember that this is NOT a major COD release. It's no more important than Black Ops so comparisons to Battlefield 4 (however screwed up that game is) aren't valid. MW3 was a BF3 competior, Ghosts doesn't even try.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To begin, I'd like to say that I have FULLY supported the Call of Duty franchise up to this year. Upon buying Ghosts, I felt like a complete idiot for purchasing such a terrible game that was very unoptimized.   Gameplay+Campaign: 6/10 The Gameplay of this game is obviously the same as all the other titles aside from the fact that we get sliding, new arm motiong, hurtling, etc. The Gameplay is nothing 'game-changing' and the Campaign is fairly decent. It sets you off in a near-future, crippled America and you *SURPRISE, SURPRISE* are a part of the military. You go to ridiculous ends to stop one man who practically has South America by the balls (Also reminescent of Black Ops 2). Campaign is nothing memorable and you play as a mute. You never talk the whole game EVER...  Graphics: 1/10 The reason I give this an incredibly low score is due to the fact that even the most power hungry, beastly PCs, cannot run this game better than Battlefield 4. The game looks the same as MW3 but this game is horribly optimized to the point where I cannot run this game adeptly on my gaming rig... (Which CAN run Battlefield 4 on Ultra)   Levelution: 1/10 Levelution! The best part of modern FPS titles! WRONG The game just epically failed in this attempt to woo me over to buy the game. Here is a list of the WORST ideas possible: The logs roll down the hill and kill whoever is in the area! The Gas Station blows up and falls over providing cover and killing NOBODY! A tree falls down and something happens to a wall :/ Overall nothing that major, this game is WEAK compared to (dare I say it again?!) Battlefield 4!  Multiplayer: .00001/10 Don't get me started! The multiplayer has reskinned (and even brought back) the same guns from MW3! No matter how much someone wishes to defend this point, the guns have the same characteristics and even share the same stats as previous guns. The servers are laggy, only 3,000 people online, and stuttering due to poor optimization.  Overall: 3/10 You already know the result, same game every year, so why do we buy it?! DO NOT buy this title, give 60$ to indie developers or a game like Binding of Isaac who really was creative and took YEARS to come out with a new game , not one or two! This game is a waste of money when you simmer it down, the lack of enthusiasm on this title should have warned me. DO NOT even get this on console, I forewarn you, it's poo, don't buy it and Steam, please remove this game, nobody is playing it anyway and the majority of people who are, are hackers :)     "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a die hard fan for Call of Duty since the beginning.  I am truly dissapointed with what has become of the series.  Sadly, I won't support any more of Infinity wards games.   Not reccomended."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Servers are laggy, to many hackers with no way to get rid of them, no dedicated ranked servers. This game is an epic failure!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nice graphics, well though of multiplayer gaming. Sadly, not much is done towards anti-cheats as hackers are rampant and not put in their place quickly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just another garbage game from Infinity Ward.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Totally waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I regret buying this piece of garbage, poorly optimized on the pc and looks like s**t. Good thing i didnt pay full price for this pile of turd."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a total piece of sh*t, single player sucks and multipplayer sucks even more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The hacking issue on PC has never been resolved since launch!!! IW is forcing PC players to dumb down to console player levels (where the cash-cow is). This is what shareholders and corporate industry will get you; a big piece of sh%t game targeted to kiddies on limited allowance money and sweatpant wearing toothless hillbillies on crack that can't play on their PCs because they can only run stupid mindless web based games. I have never been this mad about a game. A waste of $60 that I will never see again; what a scam!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Utter crap. Infinity Ward has always been my favourite from the 2 CoD devs (the other being Treyarch), but this time, they have performed very poorly. Not only this game feels like a console port with sluggish graphics, stuttering, freezes on a top-end PC (while graphically not being anywhere near BF4 which runs @60 fps on ultra). It's a fun game for few hours, but most definately not worth the money. I picked it up on sale and am regretting the 50% price I paid. Hopefuly singleplayer campaign will make the investement worth, though so far it's been dissapointing as well as multiplayer."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I Have seen better cod games and this one is the worst, single player yeah was a good story line but mutiplayer come steam get your act together far to many hackers, get your big arses off the seat and do something, get vac banning, as for the price yeah its ok for ps3/4 or xbox but for pc come on need alot of work make it that price compared to BF4 thats a game i think is very good on graphics and game play cod ghost on pc is like playing it on a console so ill leave it for the console noobs i think."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Massive amounts of cheaters. Now that the game is stable and playing good, they need to get the cheaters out. The game isn't worth 2 pennies right now because of that. Maybe they will do something someday, but save your money of BF4 or something else until they get off their asses and do something about it. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I feel ripped off! They said there were dedicated servers but up until now I didnÂ´t have more than around 10 matches that ran smoothly connectionwise. The p2p system sucks and their 'lag compensation' makes things even worse: I sometimes fire 5 rounds into an enemy and the shots donÂ´t connect at all.....the only thing I see in the killcam is that I didnÂ´t fire at all. 2seconds delay..... btw, does it really make sense to put people from all around the world into one lobby when a certain guy is host?!!!  Performance:  I run a high end machine (jupp, settings are well optimized!) and have lots of stuttering, fps drops etc. in multiplayer.  Very poor console port!!! The patches didnÂ´t change a thing. No support at all. The only thing theyÂ´re working on are DLCs - more money.......   Better buy other FPS Games with real dedicated servers and decent support. Do not support those rip offs !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME..... Please, the graphics are terrible, it laggy as sh*t, and overall the worst game and most unoptimized game i've played for PC yet. =)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game can be summed up in one word: Meh.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Gameplay: 6/10 Graphics: 3/10 Originallity: 4/10 Longevity: 3/10 Story: 3/10  Overall: 4/10  WORST CALL OF DUTY YET!!!!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,When the COD people start charging for every litttle extra for a game..time to get out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST COD GAME EVER, DONT BUY THIS Don't have FPS Calibration, don't have dedicated server.This game is unoptimized garbage and a pure insult to PC gamers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am deleating this game as I can get so far and then I am killed and cant do a thing about it not good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how can i buy just the weapons? 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"why in the world would you EVER release a game in a state as bad as CALL OF DUTY GHOSTS! it has the following.... lag, hackers, glitches, graphical errors, weird animations and probably the worst guns in cod history.... and all wraped up in that 60$ price tag. good job activision... GOOD JOB!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is full of hackers and neither STEAM or Infinity Ward is doing anything about it, the servers are empty. Then they want you to pay full price for the map packs, LMAO! Whatever! Lower the Map Pack to a $Dollar$ ... maybe we can get some honest players back."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is a ok game. I just hate that they dont update this game on time. I have been waiting on the new dlc for a month.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst load of carp you'll buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First thing I want to stay, I can say the story is not too bad 6/10 but overall is 3/10. The graphic is really bad, too many bugs, don't have dedicated servers and too expensive for unfinished game like this. worst COD ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,JUST ANOTHER â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ RELEASE FULL OF HACKERS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can run BF3 on ULTRA SETTINGS and I can't run this even on low settings -_- And let's be honest here, BF graphics dominate CoD graphics, just overall badly optimised for the PC, if IW tried more, I'd consider voting up yes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a beautiful and enriching series. Truly one that I was glad to follow from the beginning. The visuals are stunning and the story line is wonderful. I can't think of a complaint about this series, every episode I ended up enjoying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love the COD series. Thousands of hours spent over the years. As much as it pains me to say it. This was the worst in the series. Clumsy coding, No Anticheat system (well one that worked), Allowing auto-aim on those using controllers, and the fact after all the pain they know they have caused still trying to suck money out of us for Skins that should be given free just for our â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing troubles. Yes I will buy the next in the series cant get here quick enough. Stop trying to do to much. Just has to be smooth, fast, and free of cheats (so dont make it part of the structure). LOL Rant over LOVE COD but playing TiTanFall for a while and yes I know these SOB's did same thing, but it runs smooth. FRAG HARD !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are expecting to be able to play Offline Squads on the PC, you will be disappointed. That feature is not available for PC players, so console gamers have a *definite* advantage in testing squad/weapon layouts. You will have to spend your Squad Points and hope you made the right choice, where they can test everything out before buying it.  The single player game was entertaining and immersive (despite a couple of moments where you want to scream at the 'heroes' for doing dumb things, like NOT throwing Rourke out of a plane immediately). Multiplayer is about on par with previous titles, but again console players have an advantage over a PC gamer there.  If the Squads experience was complete for PC gamers I'd recommend it, but without it, the game feels unfinished. Console gamers will probably enjoy it, but for a PC gamer, I'd have to say buy it on sale or not at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm hoping we can look back on this game as the tipping point, when the oversaturation of growly military FPS games finally hit its peak and started to roll back.  The single player campaign is passably entertaining at best, and at worst it's just boring. The only interesting thing about it is how much it oscillates between the two.  The beginning sucks to an almost impressive degree. There's zero actual characterization, you're on rails the entire time, and the plot is ridiculous to the point of it basically being impossible to care about even if you genuinely want to.  The plot never really improves. The game, however, does.  The middle of the game is far and away the best part, where you do a series of 'Invade this base, blow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up, escape' missions. At this point the maps widen out and there's less of a feeling of you being herded from place to place so you can rotely stare at the next explosion. These missions actually get legitimately fun, although it has less to do with good level design and more to do with the fact that those kinds of missions are just inherently fun in and of themselves, and well suited to arcadey shooter games. One of Half-Life 2's standout levels is the assault on Nova Prospekt; Moden-day Wolfenstien's best level by far was an assault on an underground Nazi base; hell, even Quake 1 was full of these kinds of levels. They're just fun to play, and thankfully those missions in Ghosts stand up as being quite fun, if not exactly super-memorable.  Things ramp up in bombast near the end of the game (which is saying something considering this game has an impressive explosions-per-minute rate even on its slowest levels) and it dumps a lot of variety as the narrative starts to urgently jerk around to different people in the same stage, so at the very least the final stages aren't as dull as Act 1, but they do bring back the funnel with a vengence. The final stage, while technically very impressive to look at, is almost literally a straight line from point A to point B; admittedly this is because you're on the back of a moving train, but it still means there's only one direction to go and only one way to do it.  The Multiplayer...Well, it's Call of Duty. What do you want me to say. Did you play pretty much any of the other ones? It's more of that. Whether this is a bad thing or not really depends on whether you like that kind of thing. Honestly, modern-day CoD is basically what Counter-Strike/Day of Defeat was back in '99-2002, and Quake/Goldeneye/Whatever before that -- I played the hell out of Counter-Strike back in the day, so it's hard for me to hate on the CoD MP. It's either a scene you're into (in which case you already own this game) or it isn't (and you may spend a lot of time mystified as to why it's popular). Either way, you don't need me telling you anything about it.  Final Verdict: If you don't have it already (read: You don't care about the MP), wait for a deep discount. Otherwise pass. It's not the worst thing ever, but if you really want to play a Call of Duty game for whatever reason, just go for Black Ops 2. It's a much better in virtually every way."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The PC community got screwed over by Activision for this one. Game is a poorly optimized piece of trash. AVOID!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,gArBaGe waste of money. warez it for sp maybe..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If u r ready for the lag, the cheaters, buy this game now!! Can't deny that this game is still outstanding bc it's different."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"do not buy, just dont do it to yourself.... please...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same old **** horrible optimisation, multiplayer is no longer fun so in my mind it's a dead series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i bought this game as i have been playing mw2 up until this point, however i might aswell have stuck with it.. this game is literally just a regurgitation of the past and im not even joking when i say thier are borderline identical scenes from mw2 in this (watch cod ghosts exposed). beyond sqauds and a point system revamp for classes and a couple new weapon attatchements.. i see very little creativity since mw2. having said this i am pleased with the addition of sqauds although i wouldnt recommend it.. to anyone.. ever"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding me? This was the worst campaign that Infinity Ward as ever given us. I normally do not play games to be realistic, but come the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on! At least try! Worst ending to anything ever made ever. Way to slap a 'Call of Duty' title on this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and call it a game. Only reason I would recommend this game is if you like multiplayer. Other than that get your noose ready because this game sucks. Call of Duty is as forever living as Roark."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a letdown. Up until this iteration of the series, I've had a blast with every Call of Duty game that's pumped out yearly. Except this one. I'm incredibly dissappointed at just how much that went wrong that could've easily been avoided.  - PC port  - This game screams Xbox One port. the game is horrendiosly optimized with issues in nearly every field. - Gameplay  - Infinity ward's attempt at making their next Call of Duty interesting failed with repeated mechanics, ridiculous time to kill, and a generally uninteresting range of weapons and killstreaks.  I have to thank Infinity Ward for teching me a valuable lesson for the future, though.  NEVER PREORDER A GAME . I still have faith in Sledgehammer and Treyarch as they've shown greater support for PCand innovation, but thanks to Infinity Ward, I'm never going to preorder a Call of Duty like this again in raw fear of bing betrayed this badly.  Good luck next year, guys."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,big fan of MW1 &amp;2 and Black ops 2. pass on this. its the same regurgitated crap as all the rest of them. the only reason why i bought it was because i needed a quick fps fix and origin was down (big surprise amirite?) so i couldn't buy bf4. really poor arcady type gameplay and poor gpu optimization. maybe next year will be better with the new developer. i dunno.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didn't really care for this Call of Duty at all. The guns don't really have much character to them, and I really dislike the point system used to unlock things for multiplayer. The campaign was alright."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can I have a refund?  No, suriously!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont Buy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Team Fortress 2 is better...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD ever. They've killed the game ...  No graphical improvements. No game improvements. Nothing but a re-skin and re-story. Pretty sure they owe the COD fan's a new engine by now!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No thisgame sucks major donger
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Total Garbage! Waste of moneyz!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game makes my pants unhappy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crashes when I tried to play it on opening cutscene. You need too much new to play. I suggest getting a PS4, getting the game, getting PS PLUS, and playing it. The graphics are much nicer and is actually a lot of fun to play. So get a console version of this rather than getting the pc version which crashes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is unfinished. There are A LOT of glitches and bugs. The MP spawns are broken, the dog kill streak is teleporting, there are tons of hackers and ubalanced weapons. Infinity ward tried to revamp the cod series into a Next-gen series but failed at it. they now even charge money on a skin, FOR YOUR DOG!!! Infinity took one step forward and took a few steps backwards."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There isn't a more watered down, money-grabbing catastrophe of a shooter out there that brings you closer to curb stomping your PC than the next installment of Call of Duty. There hasn't been a solid game in over 7 years and at this rate you can expect the same quality in the future. The graphics along with the animations are almost a decade old now. The awful inconsistencies of 'matchmaking' are atrocious. The knowledge that deep down you're online experience is at the mercy of some loser's porn-addled laptop playing from a college dorm is enough to stop playing within the first 5 minutes. And given you play longer than that you might just get lucky enough to experience the framerate drops which can be more or less just as unreliable as the connection. The weapons are redundant and feel more like toys than well designed killing machines. The killstreaks and perks are agravating and unsatisfying no matter what end you find yourself on. There are very and I mean VERY few redeeming qualities of today's Call of Duty. If you were fortunate enough to enjoy some of the first entries of the series I'd strongly recommend re-installing some of those for your Call of Duty fix and for the love of the gaming industry stop putting money into the pockets of these developers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer sucks, and you dont buy this game for the singleplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game thinking I could play it, this game requries to much graphic memory even for a Call of Duty game.  Nvidia GTX 670 3gb"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,boring boring boring
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crappiest game ever, and i ve been playing cod for years, it just sucks dont buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While this game has a good story line, smooth graphics and some nice mechanics that I've not seen before in an FPS, the single player campaign is too linear and short. Feels more like DLC for a different CoD game. I can imagine the multiplayer is the main draw and if that is your thing then you may not be disappointed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just like every other Call of Duty game, you're basically stumbling from one scripted sequence to the next while a man who outranks you barks orders. Except, in this case, it's a dog that outranks you and it's just literally barking."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Im sorry, but this game is absolutely rubbish. Still too Cartoony, Bad matchmaking (pitting a team of level 50's against a team of level 2's?) and full of players who think 'quickscoping' is a real life skill. The games are all a redesign on the same game released years and years ago, with the only new flavour- an added dog... wow, way to go.  the game is still as buggy as hell, even though they used the same engine theyve used for the past millenium- the HD single player looks great, but the multiplayer looks like the same texture pack used for COD 4.  Battlefield 4 is where its at- Much more fun and a better engine with more long term playability. Leave COD alone, leave it for the 12 year olds. Invest better by spending your money on BF4.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the worst cods to date, hackers, lie's about servers that didn't come, terrible camping community. All in all there is no fun to be had here. Buy something else, I wish i did!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So many cheaters it's not even fun. The game itself is kinda okay. But then again too many cheaters.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wont play on computer because of direct x upgrade issues with a 4 year out of date system
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've tried and tried to like the game but it's really heard with all the faults.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you're mentaly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you MIGHT have SOME fun..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pc players shafted again by Infinty Ward. Crap campaign crap Multiplayer Crap overall. Take a bath in boling water rather than play this game....It would be less painfull.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same old **** horrible optimisation, multiplayer is no longer fun so in my mind it's a dead series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After MW3 I told myself that I would never again buy another Call of Duty game.... Well, I did and now I hate myself. This is the worst game I have ever played! Period! I can't even get normal graphics settings to work without the game automatically reverting my specs back to the lowest settings for no reason. (and I have a decent gaming rig) This is the worst attempt at a console port I have ever seen! What a waste of my hard earned money! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It keeps crashing after the 'Federation' chapter in the campaign section. The mutliplayer consists of waiting for hours for the game to find 8-11 players just to start a game and if you do start a game then at times is does its own thing or forces you to become a spectator then kicks you off for 'non-activity' when really it just linked you on a game that was 'full' and had no where to put you. Even with the 75% off deal.. spending $40 on this game turned out to be a huge regret!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity Ward do not care about pc-gamers and can't even fix fov slider and propper graphic settings.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer maps are pretty bad due to their large size. Weapons are mediocre and it's difficult to find a weapon to be comfortable with. The ranking and unlocking system is a bit broken. There's always at least one modder in a lobby. No one is ever playing so the online play is pretty pointless, with as high as 2 people in some game modes. There are no visual upgrades in comparison to the last several Call of Duty games. Lots of hiding places for campers who love to use the thermal scope to kill you across the entire map with ease. Dogs are annoying because it takes what feels like an entire clip just to kill them, yet one shot to your own leg and you die. They added sliding in the game but it doesn't help avoid being killed since you still die even when you're not aimed at, and the reaction time is screwed up. This game is just not as fun as the previous. Infinity Ward always makes pretty bad Call of Duty games. Later this year when Treyarch releases their new Call of Duty, the franchise might be saved unless they destroyed that, but Treyarch are the kings of Call of Duty, so fingers crossed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The main game is boring with too much dialogue like a movie --- you watch more than you play. The multiplayer is either waaay too hard for an average player like myself and that is why I only play 'SQUADS' in recruit mode because it is more realistic. Lets face it, who can shoot someone from 500 yards away with 1 shot unless they have a sniper rifle??? When I played multiplayer, I would just turn a corner and I'm dead already and the shooter didn't even lift his gun---he just pulled the trigger and I'm dead. There is a lot of hackers with speed/connection cheats that make it impossible to have a realistic experience. To make this game realistic, they would have to get rid of the perks and give everyone the same and then it would be 2-sided instead of a 1-sided domination. If the makers could realize how guns work in combination with human reflexes, then it would be a fun game. also. I love playing SQUADS but the only problem is that you don't get the opportunity to get the same guns as you do in Multiplayer. There is so many other guns that the multiplayer players can get that we don't even have the chance to get. Right now, I play squads, I have all the guns in SQUADS and they're useless in multiplayer. Unless I get new guns in multiplayer, I'll never have the chance to have anymore. SO THE GAME IS DEAD FOR ME--IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO WASTE TIME WITH."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I might be one of the few who do this, but I play most Call of Duty games for the campaign. Much like reading a 'fluff' filled action book, the story is usually ridiculous and highly entertaining. Is it extremely thoughtful? No. In fact, it takes itself far too seriously, all of the time. Most play for the Multiplayer (which I found dated and poor for this title, compared to Black Ops II). I will say that I did enjoy the Campaign, it was very entertaining to play though, although as a game it fell short regarding having any 'new' elements.   Infinity Ward (what is left of them) should focus their next efforts, if they can pull their attention from the CoD Cash-grab Fountain, to a stellar Action/Adventure title, that doesn't rely on empty feeling shooter mechanics, or over the top B-grade action movie dialogue. The team at Raven and Infinity Ward are EXTREMELY capable of creating beautiful, well thought out environments, and yet it is possible just to breeze through them, with no discovery encouraged. Give me a game to discover within, try to rival Uncharted, Tomb Raider, the Arkham series games.   Overall, the game is not terribly impressive in terms of Graphics, Gameplay, or Story, so I would recommend holding out until this is on sale, unless you just CAN'T play the previous titles for the Multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,totally wasted &amp;60 for no even run a second.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not Recommend. Buggy as hell. Too many issues with DirectX 11 that refuses to allow the to play. Total and complete waste of $60.00
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is poop with a gun. nuff said.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"AVOID!!!  No tech support, badly optimized, no anti-cheat, much lagz not enuf doge.  EDIT* I have seen less hackers recently but the game is still quite bad =/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks balls.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game ever made
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WTF is this crap. Waste money stimulator.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not that great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its a good game on Xbox and Ps3, Ps4 but on pc its lagey glitchey and loads of hackers "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the worst CODs i have played to date. I feel as if i wasted my money. Avoid this game if possible. Also too many hackers with aimbot play this.. not fun anymore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Considering how much this game costs i do not reccommend buying it at all if you want to play the campaign. First of all the audio is brocken for extinction and the main campaign for me. Also there is a glitch where i cant pass the first mission it keeps saying i got left behind when the main characters arent even going anywhere. I even checked the cache of the game using steam and it said it was fine.  Do not buy if you want campaign at all it is a complete and utter rip off
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! the game sucks! *Bad graphics * Bad campaign * Bad story * Bad Gameplay * Super expencive! * Does not worth the money * the MULTIPLAYER suck's too! * Etc.. etc... I want my money back so i can buy something else! Infinityward did a S***ty job on this game. you cant even play all the gamemodes because the game suck so bad that no one wants to buy it! i DO NOT RECOMMEND CALL OF DUTY GHOST!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was extremely excited for Ghosts. So excited. It sucks being let down. And this game will let you down, hard.   It's not just that the gameplay is exactly what has been seen with every Call of Duty game in the past. I expected that. It's not just that the multiplayer experience is exactly what I've exeperienced in the past. I expected that. It's not even that I consistantly find myself sighing. Wait, it is that.  Ghosts doesn't offer anything new to the CoD franchise. In fact, it directly detracts from previous experiences. The Single player is very, very short (I bested it in one night). The multiplayer is subpar, at best. Hacks present themselves every couple of weeks, though they are quickly remedied. The real issue, I have found, is the random crashes.  I am playing CoD: Ghosts running 3.4gig 8core ,4gig ATI card, 24gig RAM. The game crashes, consistantly. I'm not the only one having these problems. Anyone who runs significantly over the minimum will find that their multiplayer game will be cut short, with frequency. The game runs smoothly until, for some unknown reason, it no longer runs. Many force quits.  I would, honestly, recommend spending your money on something else. As a gamer, and avid fan of the franchise, I was VERY disappointed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts can probably be described as an full step back from Black Ops II and that's putting it lightly. This simply is a disappointing and nearly unplayable game. 5,5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,that is piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fk this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its not optimised and the game play isnt that great. Have to upgrade computer to high specs when the graphic isn't spectacular anyway.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very poorly developed; full of rookie level programming mistakes. Add the fact the single player content is less than 6 hrs long, I see no reason for anyone to bother with playing this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Spec too high, online multiplayer is the slowest game i have played so far,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought it on a sale. Does not run past the beginning movie sequence, locks up and get a 3d error. Search this game for reviews and you wil see that all PCers are having the same problem. It can't be the card because NVIDIA users are having this issue and I haver a Radeon card. I hav e tried everything other people suggested to get it to work, and still not able to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is just annoing!!! i played every game and this one is the badest one EVER!!  Singelcampaing to short... i mean really 4 hours and ur done? WTF!!   In multiplayer u die so fast,,, there are many cheaters and i wont mention the laggs....  if u think ... jep u can play with bot and win easely... hahah the game sais â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ U NOPE U DONT! cause the bots play with aimbot and wh... preaiming and noscoping all over the map is normal...  these days i would not buy this crappy game again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Seriously don't buy this game.. o.o My pc should easily be able to run this game, i suffer no frame drops that other people have mentioned, but my pc gets hotter than usual and the game is prone to crashing?  Multiplayer is pretty awful, from an in game look, it's the most campy call of duty ever... They've made it much easier for people to just sit there and rack up kills, the objectives are ignored, frustrating as hell.  The guns don't have that awesome feel that other infinity ward games did :( The maps are ridiculously designed.. :o  Most of all the pc servers for me in the UK anyway are DEAD.. No one plays it at all, there are actually playlist with like 3 people in them, even at prime times. This may be because it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, or loads of people just struggle to run it. :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a buggy piece of crap. Single Player is stable, but the Multiplayer consistently crashed after about 3mins of play through 3 driver updates. By far the buggiest, least stable MP game of the series. Disappointing, to say the least. I would be livid if I didn't get it at a discount. As it stands, I'm only thoroughly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t game, everyone camps with OP guns. One of the worst COD games in history that I've played."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"F**k this shi**y PC port. If I could get my money back, I would."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"poor graphics , lag spikes , full of hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very bad PC port  Single player story seems alright, but since I can't finish it due to the game crashing because of unoptimized graphics, I couldn't really say if it ends up any good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.    0/10  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage. Noob friendly as always, if you use a certain gun you're guaranteed a KEM, the only thing fun about this game is extinction and custom games with friends and bots."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst $20 bucks I ever spent. It lags heavily for about 2 min at the start of every match.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible support to allow people to actually play online. I have to sit for over an hour to get a match online, and often that sticks me in a terrible lobby with high ping that is unplayable.  There are people here in Australia playing, so why am I not paired with them!  TERRIBLE. Needs to be fixed or REFUNDED."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Up Front: I only played the Multiplayer, i can say nothing about the campain part.In Only Got the 5 Minutes of gameplay required for a review, as Steam wont let you review the Multiplayer.  Multiplayer needed 2Gb download on release date, why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to i buy a gamebox with 4(!) DVD's? To NOT have to download stuff. Either you release a game when its done or you delay the release, this was just bad. Graphics are worse than Black Ops 2, Audio options are nonexisting. Game kept crashing when loading into a multiplayergame due to grphic issues, had to go through all options one by one to find out which blocked me out, only to find that with all to max it still looks like from 4 years ago.   While Playing my first 15 hours I found that more often then not i had very bad pings (you shoot people, die, see the killcam, find out you never fired the 8 shots you know left your gun). Some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at Infinity Ward appearantly thought that setting the maximum ping for a Server to 800ms would be a good idea, and since there are no ping indicators ingame you wont even know. After changing the value manually by manimulating game configuration data the hard way (means with an classic editor/notepad) i had a harder time finding games (had to wait for about 3 Minutes for a server at times) but at least the gamequality was better. The promissed dedicated servers were nonexistant, some websearch gave me an Infinity Ward statement that they will be comming soon fter release. I haven't seen one of them by now, but hey at least IW will save some server money as the number of players willing to put up with this are falling by the minute.  Last but not least this game is a funfest for cheaters and hackers. And while you can try your best to ignore it, once in a while you may land in a hacked lobby. Of cause you wont know that till you try to capture a target in Domination or get a kill and gain 300 times as much exp as you should get. While that can be seen as a kind of boost on your way to max prestige, it pretty much sucks when you find people that are invulnerable, wallbang with an LMG at 50Kills 0Death rates, find out you just got a server where every weapon has amagazine capacity of 2 shots, where scores get manipulated or people run and jump at several times the normal speed like CoD mutated to some kind of Arena-Shooter. All i saw IW do to prevent this was as follows: Ignore for 2 months, try to grab more money by offering a new skin for a slightly overpowered killstreak (seriously? dogs kill before they even touch you? what happend to the good old time where you at least had 0.3 seconds to cut their throat before yours in ripped out?) for one month and now posting a message of the day saying 'Mimimi, please dont use their party Programs or we will report you to steam.' For me that read like 'When you hit me i call my mom' and sadly that is how the cheaters see it too.  The game was a massive disappointment, i am glad i did not get the season pass and burn more money on a technically old, at times laggy and hack and cheater ruined game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad stuttering and FPS drops Connection lag Outdated graphics Online allmost dead Extinction&lt;Zombies No co-op missions  Don't waste your money on this crap.It's almost unplayable.Online is almost dead and filled with cheaters in 1 month and when it dies you have no cool co-op MW2/3 missions to play with your friends.Now a funny thing is that if you can run BF4 on max settings and 60 you won't be able to do the same with this game with those graphics from COD4.Besides poor optimization this game also has stuttering(micro FPS drops) which kills the whole action expirience,but you have to worry about that if you're lucky to connect to a good host. And this won't be fixed.There where 3-4 patches to date and they fixed nothing,only lowered the RAM needs to 4gb (maybe IW thought that this will help to sell the game?) and added Physix fur and smoke turbulence which dropping FPS like liquid. So I guess it's time to officially bury IW's CODs on PC. Enjoy earlier cods."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like this game very much and would like it even more if it did not crash constantly. In a mission in SP mode called 'End of The Line' it crashes at the same spot near the end as everyone is leaving the building. I contacted Activsion suport and they had me delete my players2 fold and recherck the game and thenb I had to start from the begiining. He said that if it still crashed, you will have to download it again. It did and I did and it still crashes. I amd using a GTX750 Ti with windows 7 pro 64 bit-24Gb of memory and an i7intel 960 CPU @ 3.20Ghz. From what I have been reading on the net, this is happening to many people. It amazes me that Activision would release this poor of a game. Maybe they will fix it, until then I will play some other game ythat works. I would NOT recomend this game to anyone."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad graphics, non economic work with hardware, bad maps, etc  Black Ops 2 is a way better game. Never gonna buy an Activision Product again. Want my money back"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly,  As a TRUE Call of Duty fan, as a person that invests 300+ hours in a CoD game, i can honestly say this is a HUGE disappointment. The game is a seriously bad bad bad port, no excuses for it, they just didnt do the job properly, this dev is bleeding hard from a huge slash that Vince Zampella and Jason West made when they left Infinity Ward, and is dying fast. And honestly they deserves to die, they are just getting by, by recycling old assets, and when they tried to show off what they can do, CoD Ghosts happened, a true testament of failure.  The PC port is truly a dissaster, i heard people running this game on DUAL TITANS!! and having some trouble running it. For the first 4 months the game didnt even have FOV support, something that treyarch never had issue with, graphical glitches that make the game unplayable, and the constant crashes oh my god, and this is all 4 months AFTER release.  The game is a whole nother problem that make the game almost impossible to recommend. Lets start at the campaign. PC port asside, the campaign is just plain boring, something infinity ward never had an issue with since their campaings always had me on the edge of my seat, making me want for more, every singe IW CoD campaign i played from start to finish, but this one i FORCED myself through it, something you never want to do.  The characters are really cliche, something out of a b-rate hollywood 80s action flick, that you see with your friends just to ridicule it (like most Jan Clode Van Dam movies). The story is told mostly through the eyes of a single character, Logan Walker, with some cameos from his father and a randome astronaut. It's a whole nother universe, it does not relate with any previous IW campaigns, this time the bad guys are a federation of south American countries that invade north America and besically the federation is winning, and you as Logan along with your brother father... and dog single handedly make a diference. Your main bad guy is Rorke who is an ex-ghost member and his sole mission is eliminating the rest of ghost platoon. The campaign is completely forgettable, but the thing that made me absolutly HATE it is the vast number of crashes, and graphical glitches, every hour of play time i get a crash, every weapon switch or granade throw made a horrible graphical glitch that cover the screen in a staticky-black mesh (the best possible way of explaining it) that just made it impossible to continue, until the game either crashes or the glitch for some reason stops.  The multiplayer... well the best way to explain this is its just a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, a horrible slap to the face of every fan that continues to pre-order their games. Again the pc port issues aside, before the release they pumped up the completely dinamic maps, saying that every map will change by two things, either by destroying a few parts of the map, or using a KEM strike (a 25 killstreak, thats besically a MOAB from MW3 with a new name) that besically should make every map a whole new map. Now the truth is the dinamic maps was just a last minute thing that they put together when they saw what Battlefield 4 did, its not well polished at all, you get to open some doors, move a few logs or colapse a gas station. And the KEM strike, it changes ONE map, ONE! The maps are just chaotic, so if a complete clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is your thing, this game is for you, the maps are too big, and have 300+ lines of sight. The arsenal of guns is really really small with no weapon standing out, which is ok if the guns are entertaining to use, they are just plain and boring. The killstreaks are also very very plain and boring, the 15 killstreak (the Loki) whitch should be very entertaining to use being a satelite from space that shoots missiles from space!!! That sounds MEGA cool, but when you use it, its just very hard to use, not effective, and very hard to get.   Im not even gonna talk about Extinction, played it for 10 minutes got bored and left, besically Spec Ops from MW3, and maybe some elements from Treyarch's zombies, not very fun and in my opinion if you are making extinction one of the factors of purchasing this game, dont.  All in all, Call of Duty Ghosts is a skip, dont make the same mistake i did and buy this game, buy something better as of today which is 22-02-2014, after playing Titanfall i can tell you its a much much better game, if you like this genre buy titanfall, dont spend your hard earned cash (or your parents hard earned cash) on this, get something worth buying, anything else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,FRAME RATE STILL GOING ON...... PLEASE HELP ME....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too much...just too much
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crashes, bugs, WTF is going on with all you so called game developers. WHY DONT YOU OPTIMISE YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAMES!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this call of duty, i highly recommend black ops 2. With decent multiplayer gameplay with just enough gimmicks to make it fun enough to go back to. But not too much. Nazi zombie game mode - you know im the guy whos rank 3 in the world hehe - is great, but i also recommend the first black ops for cod 5 zombie maps and the zombie maps are also well made! But ghosts, damn i still cant play singleplayer.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is so poorly programmed it's aweful. Not to mention the hackers. The game stutters and lags really bad. Single player isn't bad but MP is the worst I've ever played. Graphics are nice though. That's about it.  EDIT: They recently put out an update that made the game better. Not great, but playable. Not worth $60 but $20 or so would be."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Once again, a developer is completely oblivious to what's required in order for a game to be properly developed for PC. This game has serious performance issues. A game like this should be running at 60fps with max settings easily. But instead, it's performance is so completely bonkers that you are forced to dial down the graphical settings in order to get a steady framerate. Oh, and if you have an SLI or CFX rig, then you'll need to disable one of your GPUs in order for this game to run. There's also no FOV setting in order to alleviate the default tunnel vision, and the mouse acceleration is so bad that you WILL miss your shots by overreaching the mouse cursor.  It's sad, too, because this could have been one of the better entries to this franchise. The new maps are large, and with more vertical design. Long sightlines and less cramped corridors. The class system is very flexible in creating your own unique soldier. Extinction Mode is better than Zombies, in my opinion, because you have an actual endgame to work towards. Unlike in Zombies, where even the best laid plans are eventually fruitless to the invincible hordes of the undead that keep coming round after round.  But none of these things can be enjoyed to their full extent with a game that performs this poorly. Infinity Ward needs to address these issues with a serious update. Everyday I see less and less players in every game mode at every time of the day and night. Players are migrating away from this game, and it's understandable why.  Not recommended as a purchase until these problems are fixed. Stay away.  EDIT: Oh, and even though it says that I only played 2 hours of this game, that's the stat for the singleplayer game. I have over 30 hours into multiplayer. The review is only attached to the singleplayer page."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nope waste of money, no dedicated servers, hackers run rampid! Will NEVER pre-purchase another COD or any other game without DEDICATED SERVERS!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Another crappy console port with rubbish multiplayer registration and no dedicated servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game keeps crashing on the Factory level, End of the Line, As you are beggining to leave the factory. Then it asks to CHANGE MY SETTINGS. I have Manually gone through and deleted any files that may have been in dissagreement with GHOSTS, i have turned all of my fancy settings off to where it looks like i'm playing Mario-8bit In comparison to ME-SOM, (Most hardware Demanding game of 2014, BTW) Even went to a 13x4.5 from my earlier 16x9. It is beginning to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off. All i want to do is complete the Campaign, And its not even letting me do a simple task like that. I condemn this game from its earlier state to being a utter and total piece of crap, To being where my on sale deal (14.99) should have come with a DvD shredder and an Actual Copy of the game. Thank you very much for wasting my money Activsion, Raven Software, and Neversoft.  EDIT: Deleting Local Content and going through the 4-hr install DOES NOT HELP, Nor does DELETING YOUR SAVE and going through the ENTIRE GAME again.   And it is not possible that i am running on crappy hardware, as i have a Intel i7 and an Nvidia 970 On a Sabertooth X79 MB, with 1 2TB Hardrive. Not even close to 'Not enough Machiene'  Please assist me if you have any information, It will be Greatly Appreciated as i still need the 'Audiophile' achievement."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game FULL OF CHEATERS!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! WASTED MONEY!!  I've played COD for years and after all these years you know what append? NOTHING This game still sucks and no one seems to be taking care of cheaters!! COD could be a fun game but really at this point you can not play 5 games straight withoug getting a cheater in your game, and NOT i'm not talking about those 20/10 stats or so i'm talking about 30/3 or even more for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sake!! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥it it's so hard for you to start checking the ppl with K/D ratio from top to bottom? I mean if someone has a 2+ ratio could be a cheater, somoene with 3+ most probably is from 4+ ther's DEFINITELY something wrong!! "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,D`ont buy.   Na dollary naibali. Gavno laguchee.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If this is Next gen, I will have to ask what generation you were born in. Spend more time and resources on game, and less time cutting out things to 'make' dlc and creating commercials."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Here is something to consider about this particular game:  - Graphics are not optimizable. You'll experience graphics lag once in a while and it is quite tiresome. - The game is the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as before. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,my mates ghosts installed but wouldnt allow online game play. whats up with that?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I loved this game for 7-8 hours and now i find myself wanting to spend 60$ on Black ops 2 just because it is so much smoother and so much more fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Im sorry, but this game is absolutely rubbish. Still too Cartoony, Bad matchmaking (pitting a team of level 50's against a team of level 2's?) and full of players who think 'quickscoping' is a real life skill. The games are all a redesign on the same game released years and years ago, with the only new flavour- an added dog... wow, way to go.  the game is still as buggy as hell, even though they used the same engine theyve used for the past millenium- the HD single player looks great, but the multiplayer looks like the same texture pack used for COD 4.  Battlefield 4 is where its at- Much more fun and a better engine with more long term playability. Leave COD alone, leave it for the 12 year olds. Invest better by spending your money on BF4.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Single-player part of the game is pointless, along with extinction mod. The 25 gigs of Multi-player is enormous and laggy, no fov changer and has smudgy textures on a small resolution, the maps design is a joke, and also has a low selection and modablitiy of firearms. The free climbing and sliding stuff is fun though.  Az egyjÃ¡tÃ©kos mÃ³d, Ã©s az Extinction mÃ³d teljesen fÃ¶lÃ¶sleges bele.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wont play on computer because of direct x upgrade issues with a 4 year out of date system
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've tried and tried to like the game but it's really heard with all the faults.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the worst cods to date, hackers, lie's about servers that didn't come, terrible camping community. All in all there is no fun to be had here. Buy something else, I wish i did!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,All i can say is ...GARBAGE.  Hackers run multi. Dont waste ya money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No comment about this game. That's how bad it is.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After MW3 I told myself that I would never again buy another Call of Duty game.... Well, I did and now I hate myself. This is the worst game I have ever played! Period! I can't even get normal graphics settings to work without the game automatically reverting my specs back to the lowest settings for no reason. (and I have a decent gaming rig) This is the worst attempt at a console port I have ever seen! What a waste of my hard earned money! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,EVERY COD GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IN MP  TIHS GAME DOSEN'T KNOW HOW TO GET NEW PLAYERS U DON'T KNOW THE ? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ U â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GO AND â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SPNED 50 HOURES ON THIS GAME ONLY FOR UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MP GAME WORKING i payed 60 dollers for thatif u want to buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u need to pay 20$ not more no players â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing maps  too many op  at least DON'T U DARE TO BUY THIS GAME 1 THING WORTH IT THE SINGLE PLAYER IS WORTH 20 DOLLERS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player: Some nices changes like the dog and the two space missions. Multi-player: the same game since Call of Duty 4. Maybe it would be different if Activision let Infinity Ward and Treyarch work on a CoD game or more than 18 months.  Conclusion: wait until the multiplayer free weekend, which is usually in February."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well this is sad... If you want a game with average graphics and recylced gameplay get this. It really is Modern Warfare 3 only worse. Frame drops are horrible as I get dips from 60 to 40-30 fps when aiming in. Campaign is some what fun, havent played all the way through but its just the usual COD missions (blow this up, kill these guys). Also no FOV slider, no dedicated servers, nothing new, hardly anyone plays compared to Xbox and Playstation servers. This most dissappinting thing of all though is that Inifnity Ward couldn't care less by not giving patches or updates. This will be the last Call of Duty I buy and I really wish I was refunded. My overall view of this game is  3/10.ugh....  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Decent story in Single Player, Multiplayer gets some 'Battlefield' inspired deployables but the gameplay is just as bad as ever. The storyline in Ghosts SP is a bit bland but there are highpoints like the space battle scene. Everybody makes a big thing out of the dog. It's just another drone with fur as far as I'm concerned. In MPl, however, the dog is a menace and an unfair advantage to whomever is currently using him. So make sure you get one!  Graphics are decent but not groundbreaking. It still uses the IW (Havok) engine which is showing its age.   All in all it's not worth the $60 price to anyone but the rabid fans of the franchise. Remember that this is NOT a major COD release. It's no more important than Black Ops so comparisons to Battlefield 4 (however screwed up that game is) aren't valid. MW3 was a BF3 competior, Ghosts doesn't even try.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game ive ever bought shame i cant get a refund
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth getting to many hackers out there and they took it over and the suport people do nothing about them at all they say use the ingame reportting tool but i does not work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really Do not recommend this game, graphics are poor and high demanding on your system nothing impressive and nothing new, If you puchase this you will regret it down the line hardly played the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Please DON'T WASTE money on this! I both it and i am disappointed on this game! The graphic is good if ur pc can perform ultra! Beter buy COD:BO2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible game.Large FPS drop and the graphic is just horrendous.Game is half done and has alot of flaws such as no FOV slider and lack of pc optimization.I surely wouldn't recommend this game.BO2 was much better and this is the worst COD I have ever played.With the host system,almost every game does not even finish till the end due to crashes and bugs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I honestly don't know why I spended 60$ for this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A real waste of money COD is Dead will never buy a COD game again unless they give use our own servers. Game is a joke  But the single player was very good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not optimized and alot of hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Don't Spend your money on this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There really is nothing good about this game. No wonder it's 50% off during the Steam Summer Sale. I think 100% off would have been more appropriate. But then I would just be angry at the game for taking that much more life out of the sectors on my solid state drive.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It keeps crashing after the 'Federation' chapter in the campaign section. The mutliplayer consists of waiting for hours for the game to find 8-11 players just to start a game and if you do start a game then at times is does its own thing or forces you to become a spectator then kicks you off for 'non-activity' when really it just linked you on a game that was 'full' and had no where to put you. Even with the 75% off deal.. spending $40 on this game turned out to be a huge regret!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Grabbed this game on the sale with a buddy for abit of fun, played a few games n enjoyed myself once i got into it then after a few games it became abit more tedious n i noticed quite a few problems;  Hackers This is a big one for multiplayer, Played this game for about 3hrs n already seen 6 hackers.. n im not talking about 'oh no hes got a good score hes a hacker' kinda hackers, im talking about people walking through levels with the name 'sir hackalot' holding the button down n insta switching to peoples head. The anti-hack system in this game is a joke and the hackers know it so they will troll the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the server.  Optimization The guns look good but everything else doesnt really look that great n its scale is nothing compared to some games i have played yet i have fairly long load times and random fps drops  Latency Due to the game not having dedicated servers multiplayer can often leave you thinking 'wtf just happened?' when you find a legit server with no hackers, there are moments where u will be killed through objects without getting a chance to fight back leaving one to think 'maybe a wallhacker?' then u see the killcam and on their screen they were in position a few seconds before your game caught up n in a game like this those for miliseconds count. also had a few moments where everyone sprints on the spot for about 10seconds then you lag back about 5ft  bugs: The major one for me on singleplayer, im on the first mission where u need to shoot down a helicopter, yet when i pick up the laser bazooka, the chopper never comes.. ive restarted the mission 5 times n everytime he doesnt show up, just a faint sound in the background that never gets any closer so i cannot continue.  Content: Im not a big player of COD games but i do own most of them as i quite like the reward n customisation side to it. however this game feels like they have removed alot n just added a fairly lame soldier customisation, gun / equipment choice is fairly poor as is the killstreak choices. perhaps they are planning to add alot more in DLC which i would not waste my money on.  That being said, the guns available feel quite powerful n enjoyable to use so if you can find a server with no hackers and a decent host Call of duty Ghosts mp makes for an enjoyable pick up and play title if your short on time. Single player just seems like the same old 'america is under attack. Lets get patriotic!' but i suppose they didnt have much time after sorting out the Dog which has its own graphics option 'dynamic fur'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The port that this game has gone through didn't do anything, FPS is capped at 90, its 40GB install And has a constant microstutter throughtout the game. PLEASE DON'T BUY GAME OR BUY DLC infinity ward don't deserve any money for what they call a game. But the game it's self is great to play on console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a letdown. Up until this iteration of the series, I've had a blast with every Call of Duty game that's pumped out yearly. Except this one. I'm incredibly dissappointed at just how much that went wrong that could've easily been avoided.  - PC port  - This game screams Xbox One port. the game is horrendiosly optimized with issues in nearly every field. - Gameplay  - Infinity ward's attempt at making their next Call of Duty interesting failed with repeated mechanics, ridiculous time to kill, and a generally uninteresting range of weapons and killstreaks.  I have to thank Infinity Ward for teching me a valuable lesson for the future, though.  NEVER PREORDER A GAME . I still have faith in Sledgehammer and Treyarch as they've shown greater support for PCand innovation, but thanks to Infinity Ward, I'm never going to preorder a Call of Duty like this again in raw fear of bing betrayed this badly.  Good luck next year, guys."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this games excitingness is like the name, ghosty"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lag. Developers would rather release DLC than fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it ghosted from my hardrive thats for sure.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just when you thought that COD:MW3 was the wrost Call Of Duty ever made. This game beat it out of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tree. Never waste your money on this garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Such a dissapointment... Installed it, FPS, lagg, glitching non stop on PC.. Not worth it, they really need a refund button... sh*tty game.... I run a high end PC and this played like I was still on a pentium D PC..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Barely anyone online, almost impossible to find a multiplayer game. If you do, enjoy the nonstop lag and campers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THIS IS SO TERRIBLE. BOUGHT IT AND DOWNLOADED IT. PLAYED 5 MINUTES, TRIED TO GET A REFUND MONTHS AGO. THEY NEVER EVEN RESPONDED. I MADE THREE REQUESTS. TERRIBLE GAME. If you really hate someone, you should give this to them (:"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD Ghosts is a game you do not want to buy. It is waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too expensive for what you get and to be honest, its like every other Call of Duty game out there. Campaign is boring as hell, Multiplayer is boring as hell and so is the extinction mode. I'm looking forward to the day that Activision actually looks at the reviews of the franchise and start making a new game, with new features and and content.  Pros: - The first 20 minutes of Multiplayer is fun -Graphics are okay -The dog seems to be realistic -The fish AI is brilliant, because that's what you need to make a good game!  Cons: -Terrible optimization -Community is extremely unfriendly -The same CoD that came out 3 years ago -The game is boring -Overpriced -Create-A-Class is confusing -Menu freezes for 1 minute every 3 minutes  My rating: 1.5/10 - 1.5 is for the dog and the fish AI.  I hate this game, dont buy it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is easily one of the worst games of 2013...  spawns are bad it takes like 3 bullets to kill people / too fast the maps spoil the whole game  singleplayer is absolute stupidity and it is just following an ai and all the characters suck everyone sits in a corner  confusing cheap looking customization what you would expect to see on a 10 pound fps slow paced  extinction isnt even too god  so basically what they have done is just make cod sh*t and not what anyone wants  also all the people are stupid who said the maps on bo2 were two small and crap cos they were 3 lanes but what was the maps which always got voted for...  raid nuketown express hijacked plaza slums standoff  all those are fairly small / medium 3 lane maps and they worked so well compared to the big ones like  aftermath cargo carrier drone overflow ect  so if you are one of those stipid dumbasses who complained about the little 3 lane maps which were the most played / always highest voted you could be part of the reason that ghosts is so sh*t and frustrating to play if you are just coming off of bo2  easily the worst cod ever made battlefield 4 sh*ts on it do not waste your money like i was unlucky enough to do  this game absolutley sucks 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not make the mistake to buy this game! Well, I liked MW3, so this game might not be my COD type, but honestly, it's complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. In addition to the running issues, the so called 'flow' in multiplayer is non-existent. The maps are just to big for 6v6. Either it takes hours to find some opponents or, you spawn right on top of them. Or they spawn right on top of you. This might be the programmers solution in order to make some gunfights possible, but it takes the whole fun out of the game. There is no fun in spawning and getting picked of by some sniper. Talking of campers. This is the only way to get a decent K/D in this game, since it takes like three shots on target to be killed. Either you camp or you die. I don't know, why i spent my money on this game and I know for sure, I will not buy another COD game for a few years now. This series has to get better and improve multiplayer as well as singleplayer. Otherwise it will die."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Haven't you seen enough bad review's already?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,there so many hackers 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Waste of money. I am definatly NOT an COD hater (played black ops and mw2 with much pleasure) but the single player is not longer than 5 to max 6 hours and even more its just an tutorial from playing the multiplayer. A few days after release the hack rooms started showing up in multiplayer. (as was the case with mw2, mw3, black ops etc etc) Plus this game is just infested with campers, hackers and 12 year old kids. To bad the COD community has to be (not all of course)such an inmature spoiled and cheating child so to speak. As for the hack rooms part.... Dev's DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! We know you can.   To bad COD has to die of like this. Ghosts is a fail. Not all because of the game, but more because the community.  (theking77nl has the same opinion btw. Go check his vids)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"very bad optimization, poor graphics"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is total trash ATM. Unless they do a patch to fix this don't even think about it. JUST WALK AWAY!!!  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game EVER :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you're looking to only play through the story, wait until it comes down in price by quite a bit. If you are looking to play Multiplayer - don't bother buying it whatsoever. The game is horrendously optimised for PC players which disappoints me because I've loved the CoD franchise since it started. But this was the nail in the coffin for me. Won't buy another CoD game (for PC at least) as they are now a waste of time. Save your money."

I'm looking forward to the day that Activision actually looks at the reviews of the franchise and start making a new game, with new features and and content.  Pros: - The first 20 minutes of Multiplayer is fun -Graphics are okay -The dog seems to be realistic -The fish AI is brilliant, because that's what you need to make a good game!  Cons: -Terrible optimization -Community is extremely unfriendly -The same CoD that came out 3 years ago -The game is boring -Overpriced -Create-A-Class is confusing -Menu freezes for 1 minute every 3 minutes  My rating: 1.5/10 - 1.5 is for the dog and the fish AI.  I hate this game, dont buy it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,there so many hackers 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lag. Developers would rather release DLC than fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You want a free game ban to ruin your profile, just buy this game and go play it. You'll love when you get thrown in a hacked lobby and get banned off it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it ghosted from my hardrive thats for sure.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Takedown: Red Sabre is better than this game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Thsi game is the a appitamy of assdom! this game sucks so much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that it could compete with a new york hooker. Never waste ur money on this trash or you will regret it instantly i know i did. -100/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this games excitingness is like the name, ghosty"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Game from IW  Cheaters and HACK! as always!   Just...crap   1/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Haven't you seen enough bad review's already?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is easily one of the worst games of 2013...  spawns are bad it takes like 3 bullets to kill people / too fast the maps spoil the whole game  singleplayer is absolute stupidity and it is just following an ai and all the characters suck everyone sits in a corner  confusing cheap looking customization what you would expect to see on a 10 pound fps slow paced  extinction isnt even too god  so basically what they have done is just make cod sh*t and not what anyone wants  also all the people are stupid who said the maps on bo2 were two small and crap cos they were 3 lanes but what was the maps which always got voted for...  raid nuketown express hijacked plaza slums standoff  all those are fairly small / medium 3 lane maps and they worked so well compared to the big ones like  aftermath cargo carrier drone overflow ect  so if you are one of those stipid dumbasses who complained about the little 3 lane maps which were the most played / always highest voted you could be part of the reason that ghosts is so sh*t and frustrating to play if you are just coming off of bo2  easily the worst cod ever made battlefield 4 sh*ts on it do not waste your money like i was unlucky enough to do  this game absolutley sucks 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not make the mistake to buy this game! Well, I liked MW3, so this game might not be my COD type, but honestly, it's complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. In addition to the running issues, the so called 'flow' in multiplayer is non-existent. The maps are just to big for 6v6. Either it takes hours to find some opponents or, you spawn right on top of them. Or they spawn right on top of you. This might be the programmers solution in order to make some gunfights possible, but it takes the whole fun out of the game. There is no fun in spawning and getting picked of by some sniper. Talking of campers. This is the only way to get a decent K/D in this game, since it takes like three shots on target to be killed. Either you camp or you die. I don't know, why i spent my money on this game and I know for sure, I will not buy another COD game for a few years now. This series has to get better and improve multiplayer as well as singleplayer. Otherwise it will die."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Waste of money. I am definatly NOT an COD hater (played black ops and mw2 with much pleasure) but the single player is not longer than 5 to max 6 hours and even more its just an tutorial from playing the multiplayer. A few days after release the hack rooms started showing up in multiplayer. (as was the case with mw2, mw3, black ops etc etc) Plus this game is just infested with campers, hackers and 12 year old kids. To bad the COD community has to be (not all of course)such an inmature spoiled and cheating child so to speak. As for the hack rooms part.... Dev's DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! We know you can.   To bad COD has to die of like this. Ghosts is a fail. Not all because of the game, but more because the community.  (theking77nl has the same opinion btw. Go check his vids)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,there so many hackers 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. This game is same story from World at war â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terrribly optimized and doesn't hold a solid 60fps even with a good card. and before anyone says its my setup i'm using, i run a 980Ti which should without a doubt eat this game alive even maxed out. This is what you get when you port a console coded game over to a platform which should have been developed seperately."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is simply cancer. 0/5
Call of Duty: Ghosts,wtf is this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not well optimized for PC, in fact for a franchise like this, it's downright shocking to say the least. No dedicated servers like what we were promised, co-op is ok without being great, multiplayer is really terrible with stuttering, freezes, and crashes, and singleplayer, well all I can say is that it's ok, being your typical good guys vs bad guys scenario.  The graphics in this game are really dull and boring and appear quite dark. I have to say that there are other titles out there that walk all over this game graphics wise so my advice is to play them instead of this. Dont waste your money on this game, the focus is consoles now, your witnessing the death of the COD franchise on PC right here.  I for one will not be spending anymore money on COD titles, I thought that things may have been different this time around, especially when I read that dedicated servers were coming so I had high hopes, but as per usual it was a broken promise.  It's time we teach these publishers and devs a lesson with our wallets and keep them firmly shut."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"cod ghosts takes out the meaning of cod, i have never been more board in multi player before. There is no more 20 kill streaks, instead you have to be very caucious and pacient. if you run out to the middle of the field on multiplayer or go out from your cover your garenteed to die, the guns have started to seam like battlefield guns suck as the honey badger, certian lmg weapons, shotguns. I hate most of the weapons in this game, besides the l115 and the usr the other sniper rifles suck,   The MAPS I hate every map in cod ghosts! one thing that pisses me off is the free fall map, it was a dlc but i have yet to see it in multiplayer. waist of a pre order. each map is huge! with only 12 players on a battlefield size map......but somehow people seam to die every second.   what they added (such as the) slide, duel render. Look at counter strike. and garrys mod, mods can allow those kinda of actions in gmod no prob, counter strike has a roll, simple.  + cod makes a game every year. battlefied, gta, splinter cell all make games over time. they take time making there games. cod ghosts is just a rushed piece of crap trying to make a quick buck. so sad to see were its gone :( RIP COD"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A half finished game at best, the singleplayer story is disjointed and erratic, while still being predictable and generally boring. The characters are very plastic and hard to care about.  The singleplayer runs fine, a solid 60FPS throughout, but multiplayer will stagger, freeze and stutter, even in the menus, however, since you'll very rarely find a stable multiplayer connection, it's a rather moot point anyway.  Extinction and Squads are fairly fun, but not worth the full price, despite both taking place in the multiplayer game, they both run smoothly. If you want a better game, look into the Modern Warfare or Black Ops series, hell, even try Battlefield. Overall, I would rate this lower than the Medal of Honor reboot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hello Guys,  I was a big fan of the CoD franchies, and got caught in the Hype, so i Pre-Orderd Ghosts. First of, i really donÂ´t enjoy palying shooter games on Consoles, because i donÂ´t like the handling and aiming, and if you feel the same way, donÂ´t buy this game. As the most other CoD Games, this Game is very Console orientated (Field of View locked on 65, normal PC-shooters should at least support 90; max fps Cap of 90fps; only a Volume-Changer in the Audio Menu, so there is no adjust for your Gear (5.1, Stereo, Headphones); and the list goes on, but you can read about this on the internet as well). The second big flaw in this game are the maps. They are way to big for 12 Players (which is the most common in the CoD: Ghosts Playlists). I mean on the most Maps you can run 3 miuntes staright and if you are lucky/unlucky you donÂ´t see one enemy during this time. But the worst thing, in my opinion, is the Promised 'Next Gen' Graphic. Compared to MW 3 it just looks the same, until you go to your settings and set Textures, etc.. to Extra, and even if you do so, the game looks like MW 3 with a little bit a Graphic update.  So if you are a hardcore fan, you mostlikely bought the game already, but if you are a Casualplayer looking for a good Shooter, then wait until 'Titanfall' is released, because in my opinion, and a few others, this is going to be far better then Ghosts.  All in all, this game can be fun at stages, but compared to MW 2 it is a big step back (not the graphics, but the gameplay and some other game aspects).  Overall itÂ´s still in my top 10 CoD Games :)  Hope i could help with this review. Best regardes ACE "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money on this game. They did a terrible job optimizing it and runs very choppy due to the capped fps because they were lazy with there port..... save your money and get bf4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,biggest pile of crap i have ever played. Still no dedicated rentable servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD Ghosts is crap for PC. Absolutely NO WORK was put into optimizing it for PCs. Runs like crap on all PCs, no matter the specs. Battlefield 4 looks better AND runs better. I don't know what activision was thinking."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has almost become a caricature of itself. Call of duty 1 and 2 were fantastic games in their time, but time moves on and this game hasnt.  In the first 5 minutes I was a child, a spaceman, a terrorist and a dog yet dispite all this apparent diversity COD manages to serve up the same old experience everytime.  If you must play COD play one of the older ones, you really arent missing anything. Better still move on like this game hasnt. Its a brave new gaming world out there."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While I personally enjoy this game, there are a multitude of reasons I would not recommend this for anyone else:  1) Low player count - you will have a hard time finding a game off the peak hours. Fine if you only play in the evenings / weekends, but if you are home early from work or have a day off and want to play during the day time - only way you will get a game is through cross continental match making, leading to lag and frustrations.  2) Tweeking requiremented. Do not expect to buy it and get it running perfectly and smooth instantly. This title requires lots and lots of tweeking from your own efforts before you can have smooth frame rates and decent graphics regardless of your system specs. Very poorly developed/optimized for the average gamer.  3) Clans system requires you to own an iphone / ipad. You get practically ZERO information about your clan and clan war progression unless you have the ghosts app - you need an iphone, ipad, win 8.1 or one of the few supported android devices to be able to use the app. And clan wars itself if all about who logs in more hours rather than any real skill.  4) Same game as all previous CoDs. Except they did not have nearly as many problems when they were launched."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros: -good hit detection  Cons: -very slow-paced -verbose map design -dark colors promotes camping tactics -imbalanced guns, perks and equipment"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible. It is bad that you have to have a good PC to play a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ looking game. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad City
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm so ticked off I payed almost $60 for this game and there are almost 0 players and the ones who do play are nothing but campers and hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,MW3 is much much better game. It was a waste of money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bad game to begin with, that had bad optimization !!!!!!! i still have a beefy rig can play it fine just hackers ruin it :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,":( â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc port runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my computer even though i should be able to run it on ultra, game crashes, stutters, and i just really badly made."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game looks like every other cod game, still the performance is horrible, lags, stuttering... everything. Massive mouselag although Vsync is off, NO ADJUSTABLE FOV(!). Black Ops 2 is superiour in almost every way.  Do yourself a favour and walk away from this bugfest"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I sorta recommend this game. And then I have issues with this.  First of all. HD7790 SHOULD be able to at least get high on this game. Can't have to stay at low but the GPU is dying anyway.  This game looks OK in graphics but has issues running on some hardware so be prepared to feel a little till you fiddle with the settings. The feel in this game is pretty good. It does run nicely after some tweeks and fixes.  However gameplay is below average. Also there's no dedicated servers as promised so they have failed to live up to expectations.  I would play and pay for this game but at it's current price I would stay away.  If you want to pay the premium by all means go for it but for what it offers. Not worth.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is my experience with the multi player part of the game - I have no interest in the single player.  It makes no sense that a game this dated should run so poorly on ANY PC today. I've tried everything I could dig up via google, and nothing has really worked. Setting image quality to 'high' instead of 'extra' will help a bit, but then everything looks like you're drunk and having sight problems.. everything ends up being blurry as if the draw distance is at around the size the crap I took earlier today, which wasn't big due to the bad stomach lately. How did this game even get released in a state like this? It's UN-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-PLAYABLE! I feel sorry for Steam that they actually have this garbage in their database... I'm sure that Day One: Garry's Incident is way better optimized compared to this overpriced pile of excrements!   Buying this game is equivalent to buying a used condom from a known AIDS infected homeless person. In fact, I think getting AIDS on purpose is a better feeling than paying for and trying to play this game.   Do not buy if you want to keep your sanity!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is..............(u know the answer) i can't believe that i spend 35 euros for that game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks so bad! the movement is very annoying
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lag, campers, low performace. It's simply a bad game.  Edit: I forgot to talk about the latency, that is always about one second or more and that will let you enemies kill you even before you are able to see them."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The shityest cod EVER!!!!!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros: -good hit detection  Cons: -very slow-paced -verbose map design -dark colors promotes camping tactics -imbalanced guns, perks and equipment"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the gameplay but would NOT recommend to anybody. Too many hackers and IW/Activision do not care to ban people at all. People do whatever they want in this game, therefore you cant even find games anymore. People are going somewhere else because of this lack of responsability."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD game ever. Worst PC release of COD. HORRID Graphics, infact worse then BO2. Maxping set to 800 by default. TONES of cheaters. CODTV removed. Hardcore Hardpoint/CTF/DOM/Cranked modes not in game on Day 1 . Game buggy from Day 1 . Game cost US$90 in AU yet in USA costs US$60. DO NOT BUY, Get Titanfall, Arma 3 or BF4 instead! I repeat DO NOT BUY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was never one to jump on the Call of Duty hate bandwagon. I've played them all. Enjoyed them all, despite their flaws. I didn't mind the 'recycled gameplay' because the formula was so good, but I can say with absolute certainty that this is by far the absolute worst Call of Duty and an absolute garbage shooter. Avoid."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"more cheaters and game speed us wall hacking,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am really on the fence with COD Ghosts. Extinction mode is fantastic but its also very unpopular. Since its unpopular and even more so on PC it is very hard to find matches with it. There are many times where you will have less than 100 people playing Extinction mode worldwide! The multiplayer and single player in this game are terrible. So overall if you want to play this game I would strongly suggest buying it on console instead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game sucks. like, it really sucks. i don't even know where to start.  first, the storyline is probably the worst in the history of this entire franchise. it is poorly written, and looks and feels like a badly scripted and acted action movie.  secondly, the sound design is poor. it is not even close to fitting. and at some parts it just sounds like they could only afford an underpaid teenager with a cracked version of audition and a borrowed keyboard. i mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be hans zimmer, but come on. it's not that hard.  then, there's the multiplayer. i was honestly thrilled when i saw the first chunks of ingame footage because, well, it looked good. turns out it looks good indeed, but only if you can work around the laggs that appear. constantly. (SP not excluded) also, the gameplay just doesn't feel right. i don't know if it's just my own incompetence, but, well... no. simply, no. stuff like movement and (stabbing) animations are great! as well as the fact that the weapons seem to be rather balanced compared to MW3 (and others).  but seriously, not only is the amount of available DLC ridiculous, but the entire system of character and class customization. it's simply too much at some parts (sorry, but who needs a quadrillion different perks to choose from?). and i don't want to pay another amount x of money after buying the game itself (luckily not the season pass) just in order to get access to features that should normally be implemented from the start.  please, stop becoming facebook-y. nobody wants, nor needs that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,After playing 400+ unfortunite hours of multiplayer I can offically say this game F***ING sucks. The squad point system sucks because it makes wasting my life by prestiging pointless becasuse I can just buy everything over again with my 500 points. Guns are ok. There's a billion perks. Assult killstreaks are pointless since people that are 11-30 can get a juggernant. Graphics suck on extra and optimization was terrible but better than it was when first releases. Oh and if you really wanna buy it the number of players on recently is lucky to break 1K and have fun with the HACKERS :D:D:D:D:D. Anyways don't buy it not for $20 not for $10 not for $5 wait for it to be free so it will never happen so don't buy it ok :D. Oh and singleplayer is ok and so the aliens survival thingy. SO LETS ALL SAY IT F**K YOU INFINTY WARD!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love CoD I don't hate CoD. But I surely hate Ghosts. InfinityWard will fail the complete operation. Or they will get back in the game, like call of duty 4 modern warfare. But don't copy again. They were good at doing something new and this is what they need to do!  But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ghosts.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute trash in every aspect. Community is insanely small which makes matchmaking difficult enough, and on top of that the matchmaking itself is apparently garbage compared to Black Ops 2. Found myself in a 55 minute queue just to get in Hardcore TDM one night, was able to instantly queue in to the same gamemode in Black Ops 2 despite it having less players in that playlist.  Graphics are nice, unless you include textures of practically everything. The textures are awful.   Sound is strange, doesn't feel nearly as immersive as some past games in the series.   Despite the decent at best graphics, I find myself experiencing fps drops every couple of minutes that are very noticable and extremely distracting, despite having my graphics turned down significantly (AA turned off completely, most settings on medium) and they are only turned down to avoid the severe mouse acceleration issue which causes random skips in mouse speed.   TL;DR: Avoid this game. I really wish I could remove it from my games library. I run Chrysis 3 on near max settings fine on my GTX 760, but this game on medium-low skips about from 50ish fps down to 20 every few minutes. Matchmaking sucks, graphics okayish, sound is meh.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay to start of... I haven't played single player portion of this game... So this is purely based upon multiplayer (which was also the reason I bought it), just so you know... now let's start.  This game blows hard... only positive thing is I didn't pay full price... but still isn't anywhere near worth the 30â‚¬ I paid for it.  Unless you are a serious CoD fan this isn't for you... game looks and feels old... and the matchmaking is beyond â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  To be honest I think 5â‚¬-10â‚¬ would be the max for this game... and I still wouldn't pay that knowing what I know now... I feel like I've wasted My money and I'm really kicking Myself for buying this game now...  So I do not recommend this for anyone... like I said... Unless you're a serious CoD fan... this game isn't for you... and even then might not be... besides the reason for having 'em all there is as I see it absolutely no point in wasting your money on this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WHERE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS CASPER.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought COD Ghosts for â‚¬45 played for 100 hours. Spent 7 cents on TF2 to get premium played 200 hours. 10/10 IGN would play again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS SUCKS BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS IT NEEDED 32 BIT I HAVE 32 BIT NOW IT NEEDS 64 BIT!!!!! LOST 60 BUCKS. THIS GAME DOESNT NEED 6 GB RAM AT ALL IT USES JUST 2 GB RAM. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ U ACTIVISION
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is stupid
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player finished in 4 hours, with mulitiple breaks, so must have been 3 hours long.  Don't play the multiplayer because of no dedicated servers and hackers.  Don't waste your money on this title, I've played them all, they are just getting more expensive and shorter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thank God i got the $19 Retail Version because this game is Not worth full game price.  Ghosts delivers an Alright campaign with cool cinematic events. The Multiplayer is a letdown, lots of lag, bad guns, and barely any players online, COD4 has more players than This. And the Extinction mode is a complete waste of space, only 1 map, the rest are DLC, and it is just boring.  Alright Campaign, Laggy Multiplayer, Disgraceful Extinction Mode. This game is worth about the price i paid, the game isn't optimized for PC and there is alot of bugs. Do Not Buy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign review:   Mostly by-the-numbers Call of Duty campaign where you're taken on a linear, 'roller coaster' and shown lots of whizz and bang without much interaction.    Some of the levels showed promise by allowing you to flank enemies and walk in more than one direction, but these innovative mechanics are short lived as you're taken back to the fun of pressing F to watch a bomb being planted, pressing F to watch an enemy being stabbed or pressing F to watch a door being opened.   Promise is shown further still as a lot of the levels revolve around the idea of stealthy infiltration, but again you're shackled by the game and end up watching most of what's happening which is a huge shame as some of the areas and scenarios could have been really fun.   The plot isn't actually bad, and the loading screen animations are quite nice to watch so following the story is easy. Unfortunately, they make you watch this fairly lengthy loading screen every time you change something in the graphics settings (They may have changed this in the latest patch).   Infamously poor optimisation, 'though not as bad as it was around release period. I also came across lots of odd behaviour from characters such as enemy deep sea divers doing the backwards swim animation but coming towards me extremely fast while shooting (Hilarious but also terrifying). Really, really poor texture work in places too.   I'd pick it up in the winter sale if it falls below the Â£5 mark but ultimately can't recommend it as it never allows you to have the fun it dangles in front of you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Purchased this when it came out, discovered it was half finished, decided to leave it, watch for a patch, it is now 3 months + and i threw it on again, and it runs no better than before. I5 2500k with a gtx 780. This game is a joke, the developers are nothing more than capitalists who have actually robbed the public by releasing an unfinished game. the cod series has died. the developers actually do not give a crap about the people any more, they regurgitate on the same engine and spend more money on the marketing than on anything good in game. This is the price of capitalism. Infinity ward are no better than Ea releasing year after year the same tripe with *updated textures*, whats amazing is that cannot even get an 8 year old engine running well................avoid all infinity ward games, fins out who there sister companies are and avoid them.....sad times!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I dislike I bought the game a couple weeks ago and can not play it.. It didn't show that I need 6gb of memory and other stuff on top of that to play it.. So needless to say I haven't played it because of this and waisted my money, thank you by the way"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy.   Broken game, 2 out of 3 games have stutter every 3 seconds. Shots registrer 0,3 seconds after hitting target instead of instantly.  Connecting to the game takes up to a minute. Dlc is pay to win with OP guns. TONS of microtransactions on a alredy full priced game. Hackers still playing the game Most game modes abandoned due to low player base ; 200 - 1000 players  If you MUST have a cod game - get cod mw3/mw2 instead. It has nothing of the above(except still have hackers)"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So after playing this game so long (600+ hours), I started using Shadowplay from nVidia to start recording my matches. Next thing I know I'm VAC BANNED permanently...no warning or anything. After research I see that people started to warn other players using Shadowplay that you can get VAC'd on Ghosts. (No one informs us about this - no proof that it's Shadowplay...) Heard nothing back from activision when I enquired about it (probably just my luck but useless support).Strange thing, my VAC status says I'm not banned but still cannot log in...I'm assuming they broke the game in a patch or something. I enjoyed this game so much - but for this nonsense to happen...I'll never recommend a game from Infinity Wards..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game is unoptimized for PC, does not run smoothly and gameplay is nothing new. Damage models are terrible. Just give this a skip, money should not be wasted on this game. Developers seemingly do NOT care about many of the big issues that this game provides."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Tried the Multiplayer: -Lag -Hackers -Unoptimized -Bugs -No Fov Changer  Tried the Singleplayer: I lasted 30 Minutes in it this is why -Unoptimized -No Fov Changer -Boring -Mostly Scripted Scenes   In total 0/10 Would not BUY! Dont buy it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible game. Has high framerate drops. The weapons feel all the same. The Animations are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in multiplayer. The Single player is boring - like always. The Graphics dont look that good - The textures are terrible. And The Multiplayer? Has the Same feeling like every 08/15 FREE TO PLAY GAME. Dont make the same mistake like me and million of other players. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING CALL OF TRASH: GHOSTS.  Greetz.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WHERE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS CASPER.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Overrated game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought COD Ghosts for â‚¬45 played for 100 hours. Spent 7 cents on TF2 to get premium played 200 hours. 10/10 IGN would play again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player finished in 4 hours, with mulitiple breaks, so must have been 3 hours long.  Don't play the multiplayer because of no dedicated servers and hackers.  Don't waste your money on this title, I've played them all, they are just getting more expensive and shorter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Thank God i got the $19 Retail Version because this game is Not worth full game price.  Ghosts delivers an Alright campaign with cool cinematic events. The Multiplayer is a letdown, lots of lag, bad guns, and barely any players online, COD4 has more players than This. And the Extinction mode is a complete waste of space, only 1 map, the rest are DLC, and it is just boring.  Alright Campaign, Laggy Multiplayer, Disgraceful Extinction Mode. This game is worth about the price i paid, the game isn't optimized for PC and there is alot of bugs. Do Not Buy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign review:   Mostly by-the-numbers Call of Duty campaign where you're taken on a linear, 'roller coaster' and shown lots of whizz and bang without much interaction.    Some of the levels showed promise by allowing you to flank enemies and walk in more than one direction, but these innovative mechanics are short lived as you're taken back to the fun of pressing F to watch a bomb being planted, pressing F to watch an enemy being stabbed or pressing F to watch a door being opened.   Promise is shown further still as a lot of the levels revolve around the idea of stealthy infiltration, but again you're shackled by the game and end up watching most of what's happening which is a huge shame as some of the areas and scenarios could have been really fun.   The plot isn't actually bad, and the loading screen animations are quite nice to watch so following the story is easy. Unfortunately, they make you watch this fairly lengthy loading screen every time you change something in the graphics settings (They may have changed this in the latest patch).   Infamously poor optimisation, 'though not as bad as it was around release period. I also came across lots of odd behaviour from characters such as enemy deep sea divers doing the backwards swim animation but coming towards me extremely fast while shooting (Hilarious but also terrifying). Really, really poor texture work in places too.   I'd pick it up in the winter sale if it falls below the Â£5 mark but ultimately can't recommend it as it never allows you to have the fun it dangles in front of you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Purchased this when it came out, discovered it was half finished, decided to leave it, watch for a patch, it is now 3 months + and i threw it on again, and it runs no better than before. I5 2500k with a gtx 780. This game is a joke, the developers are nothing more than capitalists who have actually robbed the public by releasing an unfinished game. the cod series has died. the developers actually do not give a crap about the people any more, they regurgitate on the same engine and spend more money on the marketing than on anything good in game. This is the price of capitalism. Infinity ward are no better than Ea releasing year after year the same tripe with *updated textures*, whats amazing is that cannot even get an 8 year old engine running well................avoid all infinity ward games, fins out who there sister companies are and avoid them.....sad times!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute trash in every aspect. Community is insanely small which makes matchmaking difficult enough, and on top of that the matchmaking itself is apparently garbage compared to Black Ops 2. Found myself in a 55 minute queue just to get in Hardcore TDM one night, was able to instantly queue in to the same gamemode in Black Ops 2 despite it having less players in that playlist.  Graphics are nice, unless you include textures of practically everything. The textures are awful.   Sound is strange, doesn't feel nearly as immersive as some past games in the series.   Despite the decent at best graphics, I find myself experiencing fps drops every couple of minutes that are very noticable and extremely distracting, despite having my graphics turned down significantly (AA turned off completely, most settings on medium) and they are only turned down to avoid the severe mouse acceleration issue which causes random skips in mouse speed.   TL;DR: Avoid this game. I really wish I could remove it from my games library. I run Chrysis 3 on near max settings fine on my GTX 760, but this game on medium-low skips about from 50ish fps down to 20 every few minutes. Matchmaking sucks, graphics okayish, sound is meh.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wate Of money. Game play fails in comparison to other CoD games. Its glitchy and i was banned after playing for a hour. When i contacted them about the ban they kept me busy long enough to make sure i couldnt get my money back from steam and in the end i was never told why i was banned. The CoD games before never game me a problem but after my experience with this game i dont plan to buy another CoD game. If this is how they handle things like this then i recomend not buying any game by this company. Even with other systems, Such as the PS4, i have seen it be glitchy when my friends play. all in all it is a waste of money on any system."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS SUCKS BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS IT NEEDED 32 BIT I HAVE 32 BIT NOW IT NEEDS 64 BIT!!!!! LOST 60 BUCKS. THIS GAME DOESNT NEED 6 GB RAM AT ALL IT USES JUST 2 GB RAM. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ U ACTIVISION

Connecting to the game takes up to a minute. Dlc is pay to win with OP guns. TONS of microtransactions on a alredy full priced game.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the gameplay but would NOT recommend to anybody. Too many hackers and IW/Activision do not care to ban people at all. People do whatever they want in this game, therefore you cant even find games anymore. People are going somewhere else because of this lack of responsability."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has almost become a caricature of itself. Call of duty 1 and 2 were fantastic games in their time, but time moves on and this game hasnt.  In the first 5 minutes I was a child, a spaceman, a terrorist and a dog yet dispite all this apparent diversity COD manages to serve up the same old experience everytime.  If you must play COD play one of the older ones, you really arent missing anything. Better still move on like this game hasnt. Its a brave new gaming world out there."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"SUMMARY: PRO: Good Campaign/ok graphics CON: Terrible PC optomization and broken multiplayer  That being said, the campaign is splendid, it's the same action packed campaign we have come to expect year after year from both developers. Despite the campaign though, it has little else to praise for however. Multiplayers matches are hard to join despite showing thousands of players at the moment. Frame rate drops constantly and is quite inconsistent a majority of the time. Menus and interface strongly made for console, not PC. Extinction isalright, however, gets quite tedious if playing alone with no real objective other than to plant drills and run trying to exterminate alien hives, and with only one map, it really isn't special compared to zombies from Treyarch. Multiplayer also seems to be broken with NO dedicated servers, poor matchmaking, and unbalanced teams a fair amount of the time. Graphics are good for a Call of Duty game, however, medioce compared to some other recent releases. It is clear that the game was ported from the xbox 360/PS3 version of the game and not the next gen consoles of the Xbox One which is terrible craftsmanship for the game as a whole. It is clear after Infinity Ward lost most of their original founders and members, the company that was left is trying to rebuild it's once great company, but it isn't fullfiling the hole the orignal infinity ward team made and set the bar for Call of Duty games. In the end, if you have any thought of purchasing 'Call of Duty: Ghosts' you should buy it only and ONLY with the campaign in mind. Mutliplayer is broken beyond reason and the game in general is terribly optomized for PC, even 'Call of Duty Black Ops 2' had a better optomized por than this. However, for the price you pay, it is hard justifying the $60 dollar price tag.   Pros: -Great Campaign and ends with set up to the next Infinity Ward Game -Action sequences plentiful   Cons:  -Broken Multiplayer -Mediocre 'Next gen' graphics compared to more recent releases  -Terrible PC optomization  -Extremely limited graphic settings -No dedicated graphics -Poor matchmaking system -Frame rate inconsistency often"
Call of Duty: Ghosts," 'I regret everything I've ever done.'   So, I thought it'd be a great decision to buy this game during the 50% off sale. I was like, 'Damn, a Call of Duty game is actually 50% off? You don't see that every day.'  I heard a LOT of bad things about this game, but people can be heavily opinionated against Call of Duty for its lackluster multiplayer, its way-too-over-the-top campaign and its pathetic rehash of the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over and over again. But, after what seemed to be a revitalization of the series (Black Ops II), I thought, 'Well, Infinity Ward is doing something different, and they made COD4, so this game has to be at least decent, right?'  I was wrong. And I regret everything I've ever done.  This game is not only  WORSE  than Modern Warfare 3 (and I say that  very  painfully, because I thought that would be the  worst  Call of Duty game), but it actually astounds me on how not only it's a bad game, but it's also a  terrible â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing PC port.   Let's start off with the campaign, which is...lackluster, to say the least, in a lot of departments. So, we start off our 'campaign' with backstory (usual for any game). And this is when my problems with this game begin. If you turn on captions in the game, not only are they not Modern Warfare-styled in the PC version while they are on consoles (I would be fine with this if they  didn't  choose text that's worse than Comic Sans), but the size of it is so damn big that it takes up nearly a fourth of the screen. I didn't think much of it, so I just moved along, because captions are something that's not really important to make a good game (TF2 doesn't have (working) captions, and it's amazing). Immediately when the campaign was interactive, the game took a  huge  frame drop for no reason. Granted, I was recording with FRAPS, and when I paused the recording, the game ran perfectly fine. But what bothered me was that  I was getting 30 frames per second on  normal  settings on this game . I run Battlefield 4 perfectly fine, 60 FPS, high settings, no frame drops or crashes. Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game lagging for me on  normal  settings?  Anyway, I progressed on with the game, and by the time I got to the point where â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was exploding and we had to push open a door (which you literally press a button and win the fight, apparently), a white light appeared and...  The game crashed.  I'm not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding, the game crashed on a scripted sequence. And it never does that on console. Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ does it do it here.  I rebooted the game, and (thankfully) my progress was where it was at last time. So, now I find myself at a space station. I explore for a bit, and then some bad guys show up, and I shoot them, and I realize they aren't Russians. Okay, cool, something new for once (even though Battlefield 4 kind of did that with the Chinese and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but Russia was still there, so whatever). You go to blow up this intergalactic space station sort of thing and then you die. No, seriously, you die within, like, 10 minutes of taking control of the character, and that's if you go really,  really  slow. Good job, game, I certainly feel the emotion of dying.  BECAUSE THAT EXISTS.   So, more backstory, apparently the bad guys were a troupe called the 'Federation', which consisted of all South American countries. There's no reason as to why they banded together, they just did. Okay, so this is like, what, did someone just invade all the South American countries and the leaders were like, 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you got me red-handed, take over my country'? Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding me? Explain this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, god dammit, it's driving me nuts finding a plot hole within the  first thirty minutes of the game .  Back to controlling some guy named Logan on the ground (oh yeah, his name is Logan Walker). More explosions, Michael Bay apparently directed this game or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you jump onto a house that nearly collapses on you, and you nearly die, but then your father comes and picks you up in his truck while â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing explosions and fire is  everywhere around him . Realism, ladies and gentlemen. It's just amazingly stellar in a game that prides itself on its realism. /sarcasm  Some more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens, you take control of a dog--oh yeah, I completely forgot about the dog!  So, yeah, apparently, when this game was still in development, Infinity Ward and Activision were making a big deal out of two things in particular: realistic dogs and   fish AI  . I wish I was joking, but I'm not, they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing made a big deal out of something that was  IN VIDEO GAMES SINCE SUPER MARIO 64 , and acting like it was new. And I'm gonna be honest, I never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing saw the fish AI in this game. At all. There's no sequence where you get to see it, to show you 'Hey, look what we did', they just added it in there for people looking for easter eggs or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Also, the dogs aren't realistic. They â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing move like a walrus and their fur is textured so badly that I'm pretty sure I can actually see some white, untextured spots on their fur. Good job, Infinity Ward, you made two broken features that you praised so immensely. You should feel proud.  Anyway, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens, and you apparently become a part of this squad called Ghosts that your dad was secretly a part of this entire time (wow, thanks for telling me, Dad) and then you gotta do some missions for them. At this point, I kind of just zoned out throughout the entire campaign because I already knew how this campaign was going to be within the first thirty minutes. 'It's just going to be nonsensical shooting at bad guys, more explosions and stupid scripted sequences that make you want to facepalm because the actions of the characters are so dumb in them', I thought to myself. And sadly, I was right. And not only was I right on that, but I was also right on another thing.  This game crashes.  A LOT . I experienced at the very  least , 10 crashes. There were no error messages prior to those crashes. And I'd also like to point out that when the game crashed,  my graphics driver crashed with it . A game playing on normal settings crashes for no reason, and crashes my graphics driver, when Battlefield 4 does literally none of that on high settings.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing. Amazing. Optimization.   I (somehow) managed to finish the game in under 7 hours, and I slowly put my hand over my face, and quietly said to myself, 'I just wasted 30 dollars'. Because that's all this game is. Quite honestly, I was  lucky  to get this game for 30 dollars. I actually feel bad for the people that spent 60 dollars on this game, because, the sad fact is, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, Superman 64 and  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006)  are  all  better than this game. And unlike those games,  this game had two years to be good and had a multi-million dollar budget . There's literally no excuse to making a game like this with all those resources.  They couldn't even be bothered to make proper credit music. They stole off of Eminem for their credit music. After a dramatic ending, they stole off a  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing RAP SONG. . Good job, Infinity Ward.  This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's that simple. I wasted 14 hours of my life for nothing. I didn't play Extinction mode because, despite the praise of being the only good aspect of this game, I just didn't want to play this game anymore. I didn't even get to level 20 in Ghosts because I just gave up trying with this game. It's a complete and utter mess, and this something I don't expect from an AAA-title made by a corporation that makes good games every now and then, and developed by a company that  made two â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good games in the first place .  Infinity Ward, you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid. Never make games ever again. Ever since those two guys quit your team, you're basically done for. I'm tired of this stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that you're releasing.  NEVER. MAKE. A GAME. EVER AGAIN. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm going tell like it is. To me IW didn't put in enought thought for their PC gamers. The sad truth is that this could be just another MW3 and idk which one is worst. I would suggest you wait until a free weekend comes around before buying the game. You might just thank me for it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This has to be one of the worst Call of Duty games ever. All i have to say about the game are CONS: - Crashes very often, - FPS drops, no matter how good your system is, - Gun sounds make you feel like you're shooting a toy gun, - Multiplayer maps are really confusing and have a lot of useless detail.  I guess the good old days of Modern Warfare 2 are gone for ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"How a game like this can be so badly optimized for the PC is absolutely unbelievable. No matter the settings, the game still suffers from framerate dips, constant slowdown, and other issues that are unacceptable in a fast paced shooter like this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,we all expected more this game is just bad all over graphics wise and how it runs...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is absolutely horrible...the Singleplayer was okay...but could be better.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,shitest cod so far.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ver ycrappy game, waste of R500..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,MW3 is much much better game. It was a waste of money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bad game to begin with, that had bad optimization !!!!!!! i still have a beefy rig can play it fine just hackers ruin it :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,":( â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc port runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my computer even though i should be able to run it on ultra, game crashes, stutters, and i just really badly made."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the fish ai suck â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game looks like every other cod game, still the performance is horrible, lags, stuttering... everything. Massive mouselag although Vsync is off, NO ADJUSTABLE FOV(!). Black Ops 2 is superiour in almost every way.  Do yourself a favour and walk away from this bugfest"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Disappointing, over hyped."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,glitchy as hell even after a year after release... awful.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pc cod ghosts sucks dont buy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want to feel like a pineapple was shoved up your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, then by all means, purchase this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.  1/10 Beers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What a pile of utter poo. This game should be forced back into the grave from whence it came. Ghosts indeed...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like it, but it has a lot of flaws and I'm not recommending it so Infinity Ward can fix said flaws and I would like the viewer to read the whole review to make their decision.  But, first I would like say what I like about it, I like the single player, it was good and I think the last good COD was COD 4, it was over the top and had lots of differeance of kind and added a lot of variety to the objectives, but it's still COD, it's still easy even on the highest difficulty. As for the multiplayer, I like the Maps, they're pretty big (by COD standards) and the classes seem realy balanced (again, by COD standards) and as the balance, Ghosts is closer to counter-strike than the series has been a long time.  Now, here's what's wrong with it: The PC port is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! The frame rate dips even on high end PCs, yet it runs a solid 60FPS on 9-year-old consoles, the FOV is caped at 80, there are no dedicated servers or modding tools and nobody plays on PC because of this. No, really, sometimes there aren't enough people in a lobby to start a game and it's like that for a long time. I hope these issues get resolved by the time some of you read this, as of the time I'm writting this, it is the 14th of March 2014 so please check the update history for changes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been allured by awesome advertising, that fancy free multiplayer weekend, and hundreds of hours of multiplayer sessions with COD2 and COD4. When I've bought it, after the free weekend, I've discovered how weak is the matchmaking and how bad is the game itself. Lag issues everywhere, DLC for everything, stupid menus that makes you bump from singleplayer application to the multiplayer one, stupid 'connecting to your profile' awaiting after you open the multiplayer mode and you want to enter into a game (it should be made automatically in background while loading the application itself, ingame objectives that noobs can easily corrupt and make all the team suffer from his ignorance, I've tried to find some veteran extincion mode players (2 in the whole world were playing with it), etc.  My worst 40â‚¬ spent in my life. I'm a jerk."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"On the multiplayer side in its current state this game is infested with cheaters and hackers. The game also has a vast number of problems such as menu lag, freezing, crashing, and frame rate issues. The lack of communication and commitment by the developer Infinity Ward demonstrates that this game will not be fixed anytime soon. I absolutely can not recommened this game to anyone until its serious issues are resolved. It is simply unplayable and most definitely unenjoyable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A huge step back, Don't waste your money. 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the worst games i have ever played in my entire life, possibly the worst PC port in existence. Please dont give this company more money than we already have done."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like shooting sh!t, great, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a great story, this is not the game for you, it's sh!t the way I see it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What kind of shooter doesn't have a hat simulator
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't even run this, in black ops II is set in 2025 but this is way over! I think it's a waste of money, 39.99 for this peice of crap! I want a refund."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its a good game, but it's difficult to find a match, spawn is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, map too large,promoting camping, so many hackers on steam now, and IW still do nothing. ruining the game..... good game anyway but not worth buying"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont waste your money on this franchise anymore. Call of Duty USED to be one of the best fps games out, but that was a long time ago. Now its almost as bad a most f2p games. Constantly wanting u to spend money on absolutely useless things like 'special' camo's....... Whats so special about them. Do they boost yer speed, health, give you auto aim....... NO. They're even that short for ideas they have to re-hash old maps and weapons just to fill in the gaps. Hell, They even went so far as to include 2 Movie characters that have absolutely no place in the call of duty universe. Again, DO NOT WASTE YOURT MONEY."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was never one to jump on the Call of Duty hate bandwagon. I've played them all. Enjoyed them all, despite their flaws. I didn't mind the 'recycled gameplay' because the formula was so good, but I can say with absolute certainty that this is by far the absolute worst Call of Duty and an absolute garbage shooter. Avoid."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lets be realistic here the TRUE cod franchise with accual work in it was Cod 1 to Cod Black Ops 2 and thats all , Ghost is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing crap witch will make you buy it for idk who , buyed this game just cuz my friend wanted to play a lil bit , in that 0.4 his veins were filled with frustration and wtf`ness and then i played 0.3 hours . in 0.3 this game will make you thing way defrent where cod whent wrong , and one last thing WTF IS WRONG WITH THAT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING OVERPOWER DOG GEEZUS CHRIST"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Since Vincent Zampella, Jason West, Steve Fukuda and other genious people from Infinity Ward left Activision, for me Call of Duty lost it's magic. And i feel that a magic back with Titanfall, created by Zampella and he's new Respawn team. So i am not recommending to anyone to purchase COD if you really want some magic FPS. Vincent Zampella knows a big secret: how to give gamers exactly what they want, while Activision knows only how to get gamer's money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like shooting sh!t, great, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a great story, this is not the game for you, it's sh!t the way I see it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The final nail in the CoD coffin.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,look this game is trash unplayable not even singleplayer can play only the map nightfall and tremor work in multiplayer i wish st_eam could have a refund button or an exchange button
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What kind of shooter doesn't have a hat simulator
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can i get the refund pls Gaben? Because the multiplayer here is dead, optimalization is dead... Damn... CoD will never be that cool and shiny as before. Nobody playing it, so there's no need to buy it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Warning this game will cause the following  Throwing of peripherals Camping with thermal scopes &amp; IED's Arch eyes (Eye Strain) Headache Raging Hair loss &amp; Use of foul language
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game had a lot of promises but was poorly secured. Hades and other hackers didn't get banned permantely so game play wasn't that fun. The single player missiions were okay but not to difficult and short story line.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,alittle better graphics and like rest of cods in replays and in single you hardly ever feel like a underdog you feel like you always got bigger guns and there usally none of the following you chose(sleath or guns blazing) and story is low it goes up then goes to just fighting like old cods - adding any story hardly expec for very end
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Despite all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I give COD, I typically find myself buying them every now and then to experience the over the top campaigns, and boy did this one deliver!  It's like a B movie; it's so funny! The story takes itself so seriously despite how ridiculous it is. So there are these dudes called Ghosts, but their role isn't exactly explained and most of them are old men, so I just imagine senile old men fighting and playing pretend war during a real war. I was expecting something like them being past marines or US citizens fighting against the odds to take their country back. Boy, was I suprised! Honestly the story is like Tommy Wiseau's â€œThe Roomâ€ but with more headshots and less sleeping with Mark, and with a Dog so that it's next gen.  Infinity Ward's arrogance brought me one of the best guilty pleasures. Oh, multiplayer was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I guess. I only really play singleplayer. If you're curious about the game get it on a discount. The campaign isn't long enough and gives little reason to replay, so I can't recommend it at full price."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cool singleplayer, bad multiplayer"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wish I could tell you how great this game is...  But it's practically unplayable with an i5 @ 4.8GHz and 2x GTX 970s in SLI.  It makes a pretty decent slideshow...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My least favourite Call of Duty game was always Black Ops, mainly because of it's technical performance (a game-crashing glitch that was patched only after 6 months for example). But even that giant flop did not irritate the crap out of me as much as Ghosts. This game manages to be the dullest, most horrible experience in the franchise. Characters are not even cut out of cardboard, they are faceless to the extreme and you would find yourself bored out of your mind at games attempts of drama. Shooting mechanic is been there done that but previous games managed to entice you with colourful vilains and balls to the wall action. In Ghosts there isn't even background music most of the time to keep you engaged in moving from point A to point B. It's a checklist for a publisher, sure, yet Modern Warfare, while being that also, did it's best to be entertaining. This game is a waste of time, money and effort, and a giant botch when it comes to next generation of gaming.  If Advanced Warfare will not be able to deliver series best qualities, the franchise will be worth dumping all together."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I mostly play it to get my money's worth. It's very meh.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the biggest pos game ever as of yet this and online
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought your friggin game, and it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To many hacks sort it out its a joke and a waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I recommend this game for my haters so they die faster from frustration.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is crap and one of the worst versions. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is seen, not only by me, as the game that helped kill the dying Call of Duty franchise. Modern Warfare 3 hit the franchise over the head with a shovel, Black Ops 2 attempted to revive the franchise but then along came Ghosts to curb stomp the franchise into its demise. Do Not recommend this game, try the earlier games like Modern Wafare 1/2, heck even try Black Ops. Just ignore this game, it never existed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wish I could tell you how great this game is...  But it's practically unplayable with an i5 @ 4.8GHz and 2x GTX 970s in SLI.  It makes a pretty decent slideshow...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst cod ever .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This has to be the worst COD game ever I have played them all Multiplayer free for all. this is that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no one plays can try for hours to get into a game of free for all. I want my money back..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This has to be the worst call of duty game ever. The lag is so horrible and its spuradic that you can be doing amazing and those lag spike can change a 23-0 to a 23-45 game. Don't get it! 5000 players max on a busy night. It's hard to get games. They pushed this game out quickly just to make money. COD franchise is dead and this is coming from a COD fanboy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Mediocre graphics, stupid plot, short campaign. I am having a hard time thinking of the POSITIVE things to say about this game. Infinity Ward should be removed as the developer of the next CoD game. Because there WILL be a next CoD game. At this point, for this franchise, money matters more than quality. And Ghosts seems to have made a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of it.  Too often the missions in the single player started with 'shhhh... ' or something to that effect. The problem is that I did not purchase a stealth game. There are much better stealth franchises out there, if that is what I wanted to play. When we are inevitably discovered, it became a by-the-numbers run to the exit, or hatch, or helicopter, or tank... whichever.  And by the way: these have to be the loudest 'ghosts' ever.  Riley the gimmick (sorry, the dog) is an afterthought for the most part. As a matter of fact, there seem to be only two characters that you develop any kind of emotional response to and they are not Riley or the brothers.  In an era that is producing games like Grand Theft Auto 5, Bioshock Infinite and FarCry 3, just to name a few, it IS possible to produce quality and sales in sequels. Activision seems to have given up on quality for this franchise if the evidence is the last two games they have thrown out: Black Ops II and Ghosts. Both are a case of slapping some explosions together, throwing in some Multiplayer maps and putting 'Call of Duty -' in front of whatever is this game's name and out the door it goes. Then they sit by the register and wait for us, the stupid people, to dish out the money for it. We do it, even though sometimes we are questioning if this one is going to be any good.  The only reason I still play is because of the people I play with, but it may now be time to catch up on games I missed previously like Batman Origins or Splinter Cell Blacklist.  If you work hard for your money, save some of it and pass on this turkey. Or, at the very least, wait for the first price drop. At the rate people are leaving the Multiplayer, you will not have to wait long. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game developers must have hired the D Team of programmers.  It keeps crashing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,40% of people Can Play Singleplayer &amp; Multiplayer 30% can play Singleplayer only and 30% can only play multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD EVER ! The Multiplayer is really bad. Only bad spawns and no weapon balancment. Dont buy it !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A poor, disjointed and scrambled attempt at a game that doesn't do Call of Duty's formula justice.  The single player is laughable, in the bad way. When the game isn't blatantly ripping off things from others, like The Dark Knight Rises's plane hijacking scene, or reusing ideas from Modern Warfare 1 and 2, it still ends up becoming a confusing mess. Even when the game does evoke something genuinely interesting, often it will shoot itself in the foot a moment later.  The multiplayer is just as much of a mess, but this hurts the game much more than a bad single player campaign. The game's maps are overly-large and lack any real coherent design to them. It feels like they were designed only to show off next gen hardware. Couple this with a confusing metagame/unlock system, and some poor optimization for a game that is still using the same modified engine it always has, the game ends up failing at being a polished shooter. And as the final nail to the coffin? The game is still Peer-to-Peer, despite the promise of dedicated servers.  An abysmal failure for the series; they broke their formula, and ended up with nothing to show for it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst investment I've made in terms of Mutliplayer shooters. If this is supposed to be a next generation game, then why the hell does it have so many issues? I mean seriously, it has been over a month since this game came out, and still there are numerous server lag and fps lag issues. You'd think IW should be able to figure it out by now. Oh and the hackers, don't even get me started on them. One month in, and just about every 5th lobby, there's a hacker. Haven't seen a single person get banned yet. Report the hackers you might say, well that hasn't done jack thus far. Overall, I'd take Black Ops 2 mutiplayer any day over this game. It is a true disappointment in terms of where multiplayer gaming should be, and where it really is with this game. The only upside to this game/franchise is the campaign. Story is good so far (haven't beaten it yet lol). I would certainly recommend it for the story, but because the mutliplayer is pretty broken, this game is not worth the investment. Some other positives, well the weapons are decent, kind of a combination between MW3 and BO2 if you ask me. The hit detection has gotten much better finally. I can say a whole lot more, but honestly, it is all mutliplayer related, and none of it is good lol."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It was a very pretty COD. Graphically it was nice to look at but it felt poorly optimized. Even with the game on an SSD the missions loaded very slowly. Did the devs use PSD files instead of JPGs?  There were glitches that prevented me from completing the mission. Restarting the mission and trying again fixed it. AI would block other AI. There was this glitch that prevented a mission from advancing forward because I had the game installed on an external USB 3 device. This has been the only game I have heard of that required faster the USB 3 speeds to load game files.  The story was also not really enjoyable. The space and underwater fighting was cool.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Story wasn't too great, some cool levels but the characters were a bit boring. Not enough was added to the game, it needs more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer is ok with its Havok Engine 3, can go to max settings with SLI 780. Well, Multiplayer is another world starting with Umbra Engine 3, optimization is terrible... FPS Drop, Lagg, Crash, Can't run the game on max graphic with SLI 780. Wondering if they will ever move the game to only one engine that can run the game well..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a huge fan of CoD back in its early days. I've spent quite a lot of time with CoD1/CoD2, but it got stale once the first Modern Warfare was released, and haven't played a CoD since MW2, which i also found to be rather poor.  I didn't hear much good of Ghosts, but i managed to get it for really cheap. Figured i should give it a shot.   I'm more dissapointed than i expected it to be.  The singleplayer is 'ok'. It's still a roller-coaster ride of explosions - but rarely actually lets you experience a 'shooter' as it's meant to be. Half of the time you're interrupted by in-game cutscenes or thrown in a poor simulation where you have to sneak up people with your trusty canine companion, which gets ridiculously boring after the first time. I like the alternative-history take on the singleplayer campaign, but to say they took 'creative liberty' would be much of an understatement. There's also very, very little personality in the game's characters. You really don't care for them.  However, CoD's known for its multiplayer, which should also provide you with the most replayability. Unfortunately, it's terrible. I can't even think of anything positive here. It's boring, continiously re-hashed and all but one of the maps are poorly designed. And as always, the massive amount of DLC's divides the playerbase. I'm not really sure whether the DLC is still worth it by the way, as the playerbase is quite small already as it is.  But what makes the game truly bonkers is this: You can buy 2 weapons for real cash, like a DLC. The SMG variant (the Ripper) of these DLC weapons is so ridiculously overpowered, you're guaranteed to up your K/D rate if you get it. Lets break it down for you: You're paying for a game, then to actually have a fair fight, you're required to pay for an OP gun. I'm not kidding. It's absurd. If you're wondering if Activision's not out for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t cash-grab, here's your proof.  Do yourself a favor, if you're still contemplating buying this game, consider seeking help at a psychiatrist. You must be insane if you were to really give this game the benefit of the doubt."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's an ok game but with big problems 1. Optimisation 2. fov 3. fps 4. seems to be alot of aim bots that think that seting at chest will fool everyone
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i wish this game had actually killed me and i was a literal ghost so i could avoid the shame of buying it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is just too...  A) Graphically unappealing. Whilst the shaders are quite good, the graphical quality is just hurrendous.  B) Frame-rate damaging. My frame-rate goes to 20-30 at the lowest settings, just doesn't make sense to me.  The story is okay.  2/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What can I say, its another cod game with a bad port, no compatatiblity towards pc users,and constant bugs towards anything pc software related. Just a bad experience for me compared to other games worth a quarter of the price, One of the biggest ripoffs in the steam store. Its a joke!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay, My review of Call Of Duty: Ghosts.  First off is how badly the launch was for PC. It did not have an fov slider. And the optimization is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful. (both are not fixed) Menu stutter, fps drops and dogs.  The game is still as broken as it was at launch. And this might just be the COD game that killed it's own franchise.... I don't hope it is. I hope this is just another MW3 but with no sorry from the developers.   Do NOT buy this game. This is that cod game that should have been developed for more than 2 years. A faliure by Activision."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Luigi's mansion is alot better with some actual ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,id rather drink paint thiner then play this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is the worst rated CoD game so far... i can see why: poor optimization, low fps, high minimum requirements (srsly 6 gigs of ram i dont know anyother game that ask for that much [worked perfectly with 4 gigs xD]), and lastly only about 4.5 hours of single player (took me 5 hours cause some parts are bs [underwater and space parts])  But it was a great game it felt like the Modern Warfare series (probably cause of infinityward)  Ending comes to the conclusion of a new one in progress (probably not gona happen) Multiplayer: No one plays it (more people play CoD4 multi then the 300 that play this) about 15-30 fps in any match but the customization is great all knife with perks is fun as hell (only thing i can do i get about 15 frames when i shoot a gun [and still get top score]) Worth: Get it on console unless you are a pc master race only :) then its not worth the 60 or 15$ you will pay or have paid It would be great on consol since it would run smoothly   All i can say is I cant believe my favorite dear Infinityward would allow this on PC  Infinityward created the best: Modern warfare series (MW2 the best) and now they crumbled down due to one little mistake of porting to pc  Treyarch learn from the mistakes the best youve made was WaW make something greater"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game was good......but it's only worth a review to get a badge   7/10 would get another badge reviewing this game if I could
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What have InfinityWard done to my beloved COD?  Give me BLOPS2 over this any day...  -spawn system is broken,  -lags like hell,  -score streaks are rubbish,  -graphics engine is going to burn up my high end GPU even on lowest settings,  -cannot see enemies unless they're standing in front of you, -limited FOV, -no effort put into perks they're the same as the last InfinityWard game,  -maps are too big I spend ages running around looking for someone only to get killed by a lagger..  -and there loads of cheats using WH and aimbots.. never saw that in BLOPS2.  Very disappointed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible performance on PC. Don't buy it until it's patched, which it may never be. Wish I could get a refund. 'Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.' This quote obviously not applying to PC users."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Would be a great game but the gameplay itself is pretty bad. Graphics are nice, but really the bad spawns on multiplayer and endless this and thats really kill the game. As a HC player coming from (arguably this franchises crowning achievement) CoD4: Modern Warfare, I was very disappointed that HC only had 3 (now 4) modes. Core has 13, and HC represents 25-30% of their PC players even with a gimped selection.  All in all, I couldn't recommend. Extinction is awesome and the squad thing is neat, but it wasn't worth my money."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please stop supporting these people... Every year a new game, charge you $60, game is active for 6 months then it dies down and you get no value for your money. Even their 50% off sales on older games are priced insanely high. Black Ops 2 was the last good one I played and every game after that was a complete waste."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cool game , just wish it had dedicated servers for the competitive playing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,unoptimized :/ graphics are trash
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is kinda, crap not reccomended if your a big fan on black ops 1 you'll love but me just not, for me I wouldent reccomended it o.o"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,2 years... 2 years since this came out and they never fixed the texture bug. The stuttering cutscene issue was also left unfixed. Running in fullscreen also causes some slowdown and stuttering in actual gameplay. This is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t!  This truly is the worst of all the CoDs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a re-review. Your comments are welcome and please remember, this is my review based on what I experienced. Also I have played 4hrs of singleplayer and 10 hours of Multiplayer.  I was excited to finally buy a COD game which I thought would (since it was the latest at the time of writing) be bustling with players and features. All my friends recommended I should buy it, So I did... and I was wrong. After some time with the game, I regret buying it.   Single player is great!  And if thats what matters to you then this game is a thumbs up! I recommend the singleplayer portion. The story is brilliant and full of amazing locations, the voice acting is terrific and the end left me wanting more. No problems here.  Multiplayer is a different story... No matter what time of day I decide to play, I cannot find ANY games on any gamemode except Domination. Yes my NAT is open but the game just doesn't locate a match. I can easily connect to AUS/NZ servers on any other game. And I thought new games were active, I am clearly mistaken. Secondly, after a match is over, instead of returning to lobby, I get a black screen. Minimising the game and Maximising seems to fix this, so i'd say its a nVidia bug that only affects COD:Ghosts. Multiplayer too, refuses to startup in most cases without hanging, I have to force close and relaunch.   In conclusion, for a game that is the latest in the franchise, with all the issues of Mulitplayer, which is a key component to the game, I am left regretting my descision to buy, and I see why it's cheaper than the older Black Ops: 2. That is enough to give this review a thumbs down, even if the singleplayer was AMAZING."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of duty Ghost IS THE BADES COD EVER Frist it takes 8 RAM OK AND then THERE FREKING 51 DLCS SNOOP DOG ARE U JOKEING COD OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG U MAKE ALL THESE SKIN THAT DO NOTHING FOR REAL THEN THE ALIEN THING IT SUCKS ZOMBIE I LOVE THIS I HATE U MAKE THIS GAME TO FAST TAKE YOUR TIME AND MAKE IT A GOOD GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just... nope. The only thing this game has going for it is it's budget. There's not a hint of originality or fun to be had anywhere. You play as generic millitary type man-with-gun... 's voice/face/bodiless brother in a dull story full of dull environments packed with dull weapons. There was one relatively cool space section near the beginning but it's just not fun. You could give near enough any game the budget this had and it would be at least as good/bad. I played for an hour or so offline as well but even if the story gets miraculously better the gameplay is just so bland it's not worth it. Certainly not for that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing absurd price tag. Thankfuly I didn't pay anywhere near that. What a Crock of Doody.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,idk what this game is anymore   -pros -cons michael bay explosions So many glitches cool chopper missions Everytime i log in it is really laggy (and i have a gaming cpu)  People rage to much online  i'd rather play minecraft than this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Movement sucks Stabbing Someone in the neck was cool but not while YOU UNDER FIRE FFS! Loading sucks. Gun sounds like I shooting a bb gun. Favela map is awesome.  Story mode doesn't making freaking sense and also made me so damn sleepy and bored. Actually this whole game sucks!    Bring back the old IW team and let them show you how it's done!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game crashed when I tried to change my resolution    gg 10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Another shoddy PC port that shows that Activision doesn't really give a damn about the PC community at all. This will be my final purchase from them.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is scam. don't buy it! edit: crappy broken xbawx port. no anti cheat, no dedicated servers (IW lie about this) and no next-gen graphics. unplayable atm. dont buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Aliens: Colonial Marines was better than this game...  This is literally ebola aids.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its just a really bad game , The worst call of duty ever made !!! bad performance bad online gameplay bad connection bad weapon balance and more tones of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DO NOT BUY IT PLZ !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Badly optimized, more like a terrible console port than a PC game. It had potential to be good, but it somehow ended up terrible. Still playable, but a huge step down from Black Ops II. All in all, a huge waste of money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Run, shoot, carry a dog, throw a grenade, run, shoot - LOOK OUT! A bad man is shooting dad! Run everyone - BIG EXPLOSION - running and shooting - I'VE BEEN HIT. I'm ok now. Run and shoot. Yay! We're all winners.   Is that the bottom of the barrell I can see up ahead.   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Let me start this review by saying that I usually enjoy the Call of Duty series, and have a lot of fun playing their multiplier after finishing the single player campaign.   The first time I played Call of Duty: Ghosts I was really taken back by the stuttering menu. I don't have a sluggish PC, and the menu simply shouldn't be stuttering like it was. I figured it was just my machine and not a big issue, so I proceeded to start up the single player campaign.   Out of the box, I couldn't believe the level of detail that the game had set. It was on 'low' everything and had the most blurry muddled textures I've seen in a PC game since 1999. I was blown away at how terrible this game looked, and how it still managed to slow down and stutter.   After turning up the visual settings to something that didn't make my eyes bleed I realized that the game was still just as jerky and buttery as it was before.   Apparently, this problem wasn't just mine. People were complaining everywhere about the performance.   This game looks no better than Black Ops 2, yet runs like complete and utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   This is the first time I've ever bought a AAA title and felt ripped off.   At least one patch has been released since the game came out that was meant to address the stuttering menu, and it has for the most part, alleviated that.   If Infinity Ward can get their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together and fix the game-play issues, maybe it will be worth playing.   Until then, avoid this piece of garbage."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is an incredibly bad port of a mediocre game. I have an i7 4770k, 16GB RAM, and GTX780 video card yet this game still manages to stutter like crazy. I honestly can't recommend this and would advise anyone looking for their FPS fix to continue playing Black Ops 2 or jump into Battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"âœ¦Multiplayer +New good guns +More perk, characters -GRAFIX kinda blury in MAX setting -DOG has more health than user -Not much lag but LAG 100-150 ms (ASIA) -Less player, hope it can play on 32-bit so it will gain more player from 32-bit users  âœ¦Extinction +Horde, challenging -Get bored very quick -COD Zombies better than Extinction !!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game looks and feels like its from 2005 but it has far more problems with Fov and Fps than more demanding games like Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3.  Do not buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Sucked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks donkey balls dont buy it on pc if your gonna buy get it fro consoles
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money. It's a terrible game. It takes zero skill to play.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Buy Battlefield 4 instead of this crap. I learned my lesson.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing short game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible game! Don't waste your cash on this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have amd fx8350 oc watercooled with 16 gb ram and 2x980. I can't get the game to run smooth enough to play even with every setting turned to low or off. i've tried running with a single card too and that does not make a differance either.  I can run Battlefront on max settings and get 100fps so this really is a poorly optimized game.  I know others get good fps out of the game, so guess it is a lottery to whether it runs well on your system or not at all which is wrong."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game did two things right: the hit registration and the base gameplay mechanics. Otherwise the rest is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do not buy. Its dead nobody playing atm in 2016. Rather buy cod bo2,bo3 or infninite warfare at this point. 5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lol â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just full of bugs big disapointment
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible performance this game is probably the worst game in the cod franschise!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sadly Infinity Ward doesn't care much about PC gamers, the game looks worse than MW3, a lot of assets were refurbished, hardlocked FoV and FPS. Don't waste your money on that!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"MW2 with new maps and 3 times the hackers...............More Lies from DEVS, NO DEDICATED SERVERS ONLY IW BS NETWORK. I Truely Want to file a Class Action Suite on this one for anti trust, we trusted their word for dedicated servers and got diddly squat. We have tweeted promises of Dedicated Servers. Forced Lobbies after their last patch make it UN-PLAYABLE!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would like to say that the gameplay might be good but the game on PC is not. This is a horrible port, only after multiple tweaks it will run decently on my PC. I have an OC'd 2600k 4.5GHz and a GTX 580, I have to run this on low for it to be playable at 1440p. It looks pretty bad on low and it STILL has micro-stutters and random FPS drops. Mouse feels really weird, especially compared to the excellent port of BO2. If you want to play Ghosts, don't get it on PC. Now for the gameplay: Story: I thought it was good, but not great. It is extremely typical COD so to speak and it's extremely short (I finished it on Hardnened in 6 hours). It's very similar to Homefront if you're familiar with that, there's an alliance that attacks the US and basically wins but your superhuman squad of 4 people ruin their plans and save the day. The ending is also saying there will be a sequel, it is not a definitive ending at all. Shooting mechanics: At first it felt rather weird, but after playing more it's not that bad. It's similar to previous CODs and the overall feeling is good. Dual rendered scopes are a nice visual touch, but if you don't run the game on low it will destroy your FPS. Also to keep in mind is that the FOV changer (which you should use) does not alter the scopes or ADS in multiplayer. Multiplayer: I didn't play as much as I'd like for a good review of it. I can say though that the game modes are extremely short on players. Anything outside of TDM and DOM has very little players in it, which basically means you have a big chance of ending up with people far away so get ready to lag. Time to kill is very fast, run and gun like in the past will NOT work. You might get kills, but you'll die a lot. It is much harder to go in and out of cover like you could in BO2, it is much harder to turn on people if they get the first shots on you. This being PC, they won't miss much even at range, so the chances of you turning around and killing them are low. The maps are huge in terms of COD and it does get annoying sometimes because there's a lot of running around to find people on some maps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DONT BUY... I've been unable to play this for over a week now. Game locks up while in game. I get a black screen no error.  I tried 2 threads on thier 'Support' Forum. No answer from anyone who works there. Game was perfectly fine for awhile but now... un playable.   I tried so many things.. to many to list. Uninstalled 2x, everything is up to date. etc etc...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,single player is decent enough but the multiplayer is crap. The reasons why: If u are a fan of the black ops 1 and or 2 u will not liek this game because of the lean...its contectual or wtevr so u have to be in the right place on the right wall instead of just lean witha button. Very dissappointed with the fact they are STILL not using dedicated friggin servers its hybrid which sitll makes no sense because there will be 1000+ players playing but unable to join a game because its not 'good enough'. Not to mention the latency is no longer visible which is beyond me why...The lag is enevitable but can be bad at times. but ya hope this helps.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is horrible. This is really just sad for a franchise that was once popular for it. The campaign is a rollercoaster with highs and lows. The online compoment has around 5k-8k online during any time with only TDM and Domination playable. As well with their being hacked games. This is the CoD one should avoid. I wish I could obtain a refund.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"get black ops 2 instead, this game is a big let down."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Kill it! Kill it with fire!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"sudiced=BANNED. how do i know. well i did that, and you should know the rest"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Alright, I'm sorry for my first review. I made myself look like an idiot by NOT listing anything I found wrong with it. I am sincerely sorry for the stupid review. I will revise it now. Pros: - Weapons are pretty cool-looking and are of decent variety. - The second mission of the campaign is decent. - Decent-looking camos. - The new Create-A-Soldier is a VERY good system. First, it allows players to make 10 totally unique soldiers (the first one is free, the second through fifth are 3 Squad Points each, in my case anyway) with their own weapon loadouts and each being prestige-able. Second, it allows players to play with any soldier they want to, whether it's one they've already prestiged (in that case, it would usually be for the sole purpose of getting more Squad Points to progress their low level soldiers easier) or a lowbie they're working on to get another prestige. - Nice variety of challenges to complete. Always gives you something to work towards. Cons: - Runs awfully on a computer that should run it on high-ultra with no problems. I can NOT stress this enough that this should be an immediate turn-off from the game. Don't believe me? Look up 'TotalBiscuit WTF Is Call of Duty: Ghosts' on YouTube and see what TB has to say about it. - Field of View is locked at 65 with no way to adjust the FoV without downloading and using a 3rd party hack to change it. I recommend FoVely and 80 FoV if you hate 65 FoV. - Game has a tendency to crash for no particular reason. - Cheaters (FoV-Changer users not included) make up a good 50-75% of the game's current population. This is INSANE with the amount of money and resources Activision and IW have at their disposal. - The developers (IW) were too lazy to actually make the copy-and-paste CoD we know Ghosts to be, so they hired multiple 3rd party developers (including Treyarch, Raven Studios [I think that's their name], and Sledgehammer Games) to do it for them. You can tell, too. - Requires a 28 GB install (was supposed to be 50 GB, but apparently that was a lie). What is the 28 GB for? Dog A.I.? - Developers have the guts to LIE directly to the PC community's face. I can easily think of 2 things they lied to us about. 1. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a next-gen experience, improving on everything CoD. FALSE. Ghosts actually plays worse than BO2 and WaW did (admittingly, WaW didn't play that badly, but enough that it was my 3rd least-favorite CoD in terms of gameplay), and BO2 was also quite bad. 2. Ghosts has the next-gen Anti-Cheat matched by nothing else. FALSE. There has been and will never be an anti-cheat of Ghosts. Even after at least 1-2 months, the game STILL has no anti-cheat. There were rumors of PunkBuster being integrated into Ghosts, but this was never confirmed and was never actually implemented. 3. CoD would have next-gen graphics. FALSE. The graphics look like they were from 2000. 4. Server browsers and servers. FALSE. They instead released it and only revealed that they lied and used a hybrid system, much like BO2's. If you played BO2, you know how bad it is, like I do. - Frequent stuttering.  Overall, NEVER buy this game. This game isn't even worth the 99-cent bin at stores like WalMart and Target. Oh, by the way, I forgot to add something that will help sway you. The MetaCritic review was a 78, more than BO2. The MetaCritic USER reviews were a 0.2 or 0.6, something like that. Hmm, the paid-off MetaCritics gave a game that was absolute CRAP a 78 and the USER reviews (the only reviews you should look at) were a 0.6. Anything suspicious?  By the way, I have around 110 hours on the Multiplayer and about 15 minutes on the Single Player. Sorry if this caused any confusion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is like a carrot top joke; only worse.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No anti cheat no dedi servers tbh its a long list. In short its a realy realy bad port. Dont waste youre money on this piece of u know what. And if u do want it il trade it you for awesomenauts and payday 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,needs more players!!! direct x 11 only totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed this title
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There was a recurring Monty Python sketch where a group of middle-aged women would announce that they were going to reenact some famous historical event, but every single event was represented by a hilarious speeded-up handbag fight in a muddy field. I find myself reminded of it with the Call of Duty series; every time I think it's gonna do something else for once, it blows a whistle and everything descends into squeals and handbag-slapping.  Case in point, CoD: Ghosts. Not only is it not a game about the vengeful spirits hanging around English chip shops, but it's also not the game it purports to be in its own intro sequence. The Ghosts, as the name might imply, are ostensibly a legendary stealth unit that specializes in taking down larger forces through sneaky guerrilla tactics. So obviously, one of the first things you do in the game is ram-raid an enemy base in a burning truck and start gunning down every living thing from the dandelions on upwards. Yeah, that's some good ghostin' there, lads! Truly, thou art akin to the flicker of a candlelight shadow as you waddle around an open field being shot at from nineteen different directions.  The other thing I gathered ahead of time was that the plot would be about a weakened U.S. fighting a superior foe, which would make a nice change from the usual case wherein the heroes jump all over vastly inferior foes for floating the idea that maybe the U.S. could stop eating all the pancakes for five minutes. So here's the sitch: the U.S. has been invaded by all of South America. OK, gonna have to stop you there, Call of Duty: Ghosts; I get that all of your plots are birthed from the fantasies crossing the mind of a paranoid, xenophobic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥wit as he has violent grunting sex with a pile of damp moss, but at least you used to stick to foreigners who potentially are enemies of the U.S., and South America has better things to do with its time than sit around shaking its fist at your freedoms all day, at least as long as association football exists!  Anyway, they attack America by hijacking America's orbital missile weapon. OK, gonna stop you there again, Ghosts! Firstly, so much for the enemy being 'superior' if they can't make their own superweapons and gotta pinch 'em like safari park baboons nicking the windscreen wipers. And secondly, orbital â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing missile weapon!? This invasion is sounding more justifiable by the second! 'Cause not only is the U.S. outsourcing their weapons development to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Megatron, but they also appear to have exterminated every single member of their population who isn't a burly white dude.  Just for fun I kept a running tally of all the characters in the story campaign who aren't burly white dudes and you are under no obligation to shoot. The final total was three: a female astronaut right at the start who immediately dies, a helicopter that spoke with a woman's voice, and a black member of the Ghosts unit who immediately dies. And, frankly, when that happens, the main characters displayed less emotion than when their dog got shot. 'Dammit, the black guy died!', they seemed to say, 'Now we can't claim to have tons of black friends while arguing on the internet!'  You are one of two burly white brothers whose burly white dad has been secretly testing them over the years to make them worthy of joining the Ghosts, it never having occurred to him that they might prefer to become pastry chefs or something. The main baddie turns out to be a burly white friend of the burly white dad who was captured by the enemy and turned to their side. Damn South Americans! It's not enough for them to steal our orbital doomsday satellites, they have to start harnessing the power of our burly white dudes as well!  Also, there's a dog. A German Shepherd, the burliest and whitest of all the dogs, who was a bit of unique selling point in the lead-up: he'll run out and savage South Americans at your command because he's been fed on an exclusive diet of neck-shaped burritos. And there are missions where you play as the dog, and finally get to do some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ghosting as you sneak around the long grass internally debating the choices at the throat buffet. I was gonna bring up Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, but that might be too cosmopolitan a reference for this game.  All of which would have had more of an impact if the dog got to be in more than two levels before the game goes 'Right, hope you got your money's worth!' and sends him to the time-out kennel forever. Not that I was expecting him to tag along for the scuba diving bit, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing as that would've been, but the fact is his role in the game is just another momentary gameplay gimmick. It would've been nice if he'd had some kind of personality besides being just another piece of military hardware for the armchair generals to masturbate over. Although, the same could be said of the human characters!  Speaking of hardware, there are the standard apocalyptic coffee break sequences, where you pull out a remote from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dimension and rain predator drone death down on an enemy unable to in any way defend themselves or fight back. And d'you know what? I don't see how I'm supposed to have any grasp of the relative enemy threat when we may or may not be packing armfuls of superweapons we forgot to mention. Like after the enemy base ram-raid, I'm told to pick off the stragglers with the robot sniper. Hold on a second, when did we set up a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing robot sniper? What did we bring it here in? How did we set it up without the enemy noticing; did we disguise it as a badger-watching station?  Incidentally, the Ghosts are well-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing-equipped for a guerrilla unit. 'Oh, no, America has been attacked and is weakened and there's no defenses except an inexhaustible supply of tank battalions and an army of killer robots. And we would've had a doomsday satellite if the rest of the world hadn't gotten all weird about it!' Which they were entirely right to be because when the player wrestles control of the satellite back at the end, they immediately use it to wipe hundreds of thinking, feeling blips off the map as casually as one were to use a windscreen wiper on a rainy day!  Yet again, it seems like they cut out every moment in the story that could've built context but didn't have any explosions in it. And if they hadn't added voiced plot-dumps to the loading screens, the experience would've been as coherent as scrambled porn intercut with the fantasies of Tea Party members. And 'fantasy' really is the word; the vehicles all handle like turbo-boosted magic carpets, lest anything requiring actual skill get in the way of your unpleasant paranoid battle-glory daydream, so divorced from reality it might as well be taking place in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Narnia!  So however you might have expected a game called Ghosts to differ from the modern shooter routine of meaningless violence and empty spectacle, you were wrong, ya idiot! But somehow it's only getting worse! Black Ops II actually came across as at least slightly self-aware, and Modern Warfare (One) went so far as being profound, such as in that bit where you die slowly and horribly in a nuclear blast. If that happened in CoD: Ghosts, you'd probably just fart all the radiation out in one big heroic guff, pull the broken glass out of your eyeballs and then use it to shiv the Ayatollah. - Yahtzee"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an absolute joke. It was released as a next-gen launch title but the graphics are laughable, some of the textures look like they come from a game from 2003, let alone 2013. The game also runs like absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥, and unlike Black Ops 3 I haven't got a clue how to fix that. The hit detection is also complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in multiplayer, and the campaign is very forgettable. The simple existance of this game also had the indirect effect of ruining Battlefield 4, since the competition was so great between the two companies that they both rushed their games, and they were both terrible on release. However, while BF4's problems have been fixed, Infinity Ward simply forgot Ghosts even existed and these problems still exist to this day.  This is the worst COD ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Truly possibly the worst major Call of Duty I have ever played and spent money on. Although respects to the efforts for a next gen engine. Although it was conpletely flawed and not optimized for as simple as combat. I still say this is pretty good only ro be played once. MP was incredibly stale. And again overall the engine was brand new and just looks like utter crap compared to Advanced Warfare which just came next after ghosts with too a better story plot for SP, AW was also delivered by a new CoD Dev and by that fact. I really don't know how could Infinity Ward could make up for this blunder. Conclusion: I'm not hyped for any more Infinity Ward Call of Dutys"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont have the the ram i need can i please get refunded
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Used to actually be a decent game for the first few months ... But you barely find any games beside Tdm now and if you actually do manage to find a game the chances are pretty high that you will only get matched against some camping guys.  Also the poor optimization doesn't help making it a better game.  If you'd seriously still consider buying this game ... Just don't!  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer Pros: -Graphics looks good enough -Squad mode and Extiction Mode Is Good Cons: -Frame Drop -The Maps is too large for Call Of Duty -The Maps is 100% Camper Support -The Ping is too high because the players only 200 - 350 Overall This Game Is Far from Perfect I Wouldn't recommed this game for anyone who love COD In Conclusion Fish A.I Broke The game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghost is the 2013 installment in the absurldy popular series. But after a lot of hate did they step up with Ghosts ? In Call Of Duty Ghosts you play as Logan. America is caught in a middle of war which is staged by one man named Rourke who was a former Ghost gone rogue. So how is this game ? Overall this is game is not good. Now overall COD has been know for over the top action sequence that make you feel like youre in a movie. But ghosts feels almost like Infinity ward was tired and didnt even bother making it any good. So the game is excatly the same as previous COD games so you know the not much diffrent. Overall there are a few problems that i have with this game in particular. The game is sloppy. The Pc port is garbage, the textures are garbage and dont look anything like next gen and they barely look last gen. The games combat feels slopier while it feels more fast paced. The game adds a slide mechanic which doesnt do all that much just lets you get to cover quicker. The game has a few plusses but nothing too much. The sound quality is great and it has a few fun missions. But lets cover the reason why people play Call of Duty the multiplayer. The multiplayer is probably the worst one yet. The server issues occur often and really just draw you out of the game. boring maps. broken spawn system as always and extinction mode which is Blops zombies with aliens instead. Overall i didnt enjoy Call Of Duty Ghosts at all. I really suggest you stay away from COD in general because this franchise is dead and we all know it. I give Call Of Duty Ghosts a 4,5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just got Permanently banned while playing the game online..  My roommate got banned out of the blue too sometime earlier..  You should definately waste your money on this game =)........
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money on this trash. Hackers every other game and poorly optimized for PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is good but not for pc its for counsl only if you ask me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wouldn't play this game unless you have a long fuse before you explode in rage, and if you have $250+ graphics card!!!  this game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ otherwise!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Boring single player, They somehow made the multiplayer worse and its so poorly optimised for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"An absolute abomination to COD, performance issues, lag, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ campaign and squads mode, still doesn't work 8 monthes after launch. my recommendation is go get a better game that is actually worth the money, COD Ghosts is Toast."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Says I have no hours on record, it's a glitch. Check my profile if you want proof I've played it.  By far the worst COD I have played (I've played every COD since COD4, as well as the original). This does not, however, mean that the game is totally trash.  I will point out the good things first.  Like every COD, this game has fairly solid mechanics. Gunplay feels good. Movement feels smooth, especially with the new movement system. Animations, are, as usual, top of the line (though I did spot a few re used animations).  Unfortunately, that's all the game has going for it. (For MP, at least).  One of the main problems is the lag. IW promised dedicated servers. They did not deliver. If you get a crap host (listen servers), the game will be horrible. And this happens a lot, unfortunately. Many people's connections are not designed for hosting servers. In addition, the game also suffers from sever FPS issues. The game is not well optimized for PC. It dips, stutters, and is generally unstable. Mind you, I am running a very high end rig (GTX680, i5 3570K).  The maps...the maps are OK. They are not like old COD maps. They are big, with lots of flank routes. They are not bad. Unfortunately, the spawn system really lets them down. For maps so big, you'd think they'd have worked out the spawns in 6v6. But no. No. It's horrible. Everyone WILL be spawning behind you.  In addition, IW seem to have gone with the MW2 approach - make everything overpowered. Instead, this time, everything is one or two hit kill. They seem to have tried to make everything as noob friendly as possible.  To conclude, at this state, the Multiplayer is not worth your money.  But how about Single Player and/or Extinction mode you ask? Single Player is alright. Story is solid, nothing special, but OK. Extinction mode is also OK. Not great. Certainly doesn't make up for the Multiplayer.  Wait for some significant patching and discounts before buying. Black Ops 2 is vastly superior."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible, crossfire support non existant. Hackers, you bet. I have nothing good to say about this game, not a huge CoD fan but I atleast had fun with previous titles. Using peer to peer servers for a franchise that rakes in cash is a slap in the face. Posting this review as I tried playing again on 3/18/14 and had not played since a few weeks after release only to meet the same issues I had day 1. Deleted and will not be re-installing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is worst Call Of Duty ever! DONT BUY THIS!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is just the old game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up mouse acceleration, game is unplayable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,man this game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even with a $5000 pc the game is not worth anything
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want to play COD, play Black ops 2, but don't try this one... I will not even try to write review. 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,do not buy this trash...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS GAME !  This game is completly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the players in this game are average 12 years old and just camp in the corners and the maps of the game make this possibble Just my Tipp DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !   ---------------------------- NONONONONONO
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Imo worst CoD game yet, PC has been neglected badly again. Too many issues, and it has less players playing then when BO2 was at it's lowest before the new game. Do not get it, play the old ones or wait til next year. IW, expected a better game from you!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The singleplayer story line is good, but short. The game's real shortcoming is in it's multiplayer, which is really the big focus of the game. It's plagued with issues such as mouse acceleration problems that just scream console port. The fact that they couldn't be bothered to fix bugs like that means it's really not worth your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is buy far the worst call of duty i have ever played i bet you all  need to look into your staffing on who made this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ game and start for scrach on the next one and give it to the people who paid for this game for free cause you all ripped us off bigtime this go around
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME! The maps are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the gameplay can be summed up with 'Shoot 5 bullets, get killed with one.'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is just a bad game tahts all dont but dont play ITS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward promised us that the game would look the best on PC. The fact that the game takes up a total of 40gb of space and still looks the same as Modern Warfare 3 tells me that this was a lie. The texture is bad if you just take a little closer look. The system requierements are hillariusly bad and the game is not at all optmizied. You can look at my profile and see my PC's specs, and even then I have frequent FPS drop and lag often.  Options! There is ONE slider for audio, ONE! This is not acceptable. FoV slider? Nope, why the hell would we be given that.  IW forces people to camp in order to unlock different kind of skins for the weapons, which is very, VERY bad.  So, do not buy this game. You'll end up raging and destroying whatever is around you. Stick with Black Ops 2 if you have it or go over to Battlefield 4 for the duration of 2014."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It takes a hole magazine To kill 1 SINGLE ALIEN IN EXTINCTION IS THAT ALITTLE OVER POWERED? IT ALSO TAKES 2 KNIVE TO KILL AN ALIEN AT HIVE 1 WTF
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you want to play this game... You need to have worlds best PC in the world. This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on PC. You can camp in spots only youself can be and see... No one can see you. You get lagspikes every 2 min. And you have constant lag on long range. (I recommend some of the other CoD games) This is just Waist of Money. And why there is so much lag... Is becuase this game is made for Xbox/PlayStation. - Thanks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After more then 800 hours of gameplay I think I'm entitled to have an opinion of the game.  This is my first COD ever and after a couple of 100 hours people people stopped calling me a noob. I got promoted to wallhacker, cheater, camper, thermalnoob, and I bet I forgot a couple of other titles. I'm not even as good as some I've met and playing wiith. Around 25 kills per game seems to be the standard for me now. The game itself is fun. During all the hours I've met very nice people (and still playing together), but also very nasty (12 year old) people without any sense of moral, wallhackers pinghackers, aimbotters, etc. That's life I guess.  Like I said, the game itself is fun, without the cheating b.a.s.t.a.r.d.s, but it's dead! We all know who to blaim!  IW/Activision really knows how to rip people off. Holders of the seasonpass don't get any DLC. There arent a lot players on new maps, because nobody is going to buy it anymore.  People please, don't get tempted. More then 10.000 people stopped playing the game due to hackers. IW/Activision didn't care and now see the result. This game is dying. Less then 6K players (max) each day and getting les by the week!!!! Not kidding. IW promised deticated servers, but untill today nothing! The PC version is a rip-off-clone from the XBOX, not optimized for the PC.  AGAIN: DON'T GET TEMPTED TO BUY THE DLC's NOR THE GAME! (you really are robbing yourself if you do)  EDIT: Last night (30th of March 2014) at 2AM there where only 2077 persons online. Since they add the DLC maps into the rotation-system, there is less change you get into a game when you are with a group. &lt;-- Thank you IW!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst CoD to date. I regret buying this sooo much.  The story is ridiculous and unoriginal and has been for the latest CoD games, the last good story being Modern Warfare 2. Maybe not good story but fun campaign. Predictable, unoriginal, not fun at all.  Multiplayer is real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The new squad thing is cool, sure. But the AI is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good that not even me, a seasoned CoD veteran with 700-ish hours over Xbox and PC can't get good stats against AI even when playing my absolute best. They see you from unreal distances, they can just be standing somewhere waiting for you because they know where you're coming. Sniping against bots is also impossible. If you're standing in a window across the map in multiplayer, no one can see you unless they get killed by you so they know where you are. Bots, however, see you regardless of how little of your model you expose and shoot you down with laser accuracy. The only thing about squads is that you can try to play a little casually and still get squad points (the 'currency' used in create a class and to unlock new squad mates) but they take such an outrageous amount of time that it's not worth playing squad mode and getting 1 point every 3 matches and needing 12 to unlock that weapon you want so you end up playing crappy, unbalanced, classic Infinity Ward unplayable multiplayer instead. Snipers camping all the time, people running around with SMGs and superhero reflexes and hawk eyes and you're just running around not knowing where anyone is and all the sudden you get shot in the head and don't know what happened.  Really, DO NOT buy this game. It's horrible, it's the worst CoD game to date. Every aspect of the game is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you want a generic CoD game then buy Modern Warfare 3 instead. 40â‚¬ I'll never get back for this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What started out years ago as potentially the fastest and most popular FPS on the market has dwindled down to a Lag Compensated, Frustrating, Unsupported, Cheat fest. Every game I get into, if I can get into a game, takes a long time to load and is ridiculously unplayable. The PC community months after the game launched has less than a few players evidenced by the 'number of players' info when perusing the game types, only a few people playing on only a couple of game modes, most game modes have zero (0) players so you cant play them at all, this doesnt change - ever, everytime you look, it's the same story, only the punished few. The PC community is being ignored by Activision. We dont have the simplest of options in the game, there are no separate controls for volume, no options to pick a server with a good 'ping'. We have no dedicated servers (if there were, why does the server freeze then toss you mid-game when a player quits?), we have to join, if we can at all, whatever map / server the system picks for you. There are no options for map type, ping, number of players, etc ... most of the convenient choices in previous versions of this game are gone. If the system puts you in a map you dont want to play or its so laggy you cant play, you can not get out right away, you have to wait and wait and wait, then when you finally have the chance to go back to the main menu and try a different 'map/server ' you find yourself waiting in que for the same map you just left, then you have to waste your time trying to get out all over again! This process of trying to find a mediocre at best map to play can waste up to 5 minutes or more of your time. Lately (Feb 2014) even though there seems to be players (1000) in a couple game modes, I can't join at all even though I honestly waited 20-30 minutes, just to see how long it would take. GAMEPLAY (when you are fortunite enough to get into a game) - When I die the killcam shows something completely different than what I experienced while dying. Its as if the player that killed me and I are a second or two apart in the timing of the game. This is not an isolated event, it happens everytime I play. I hear other players complaining about the same experience, constantly, every game! Players accusing other of cheating when its the game programmers code that must be allowing this strange behavior, I hear accusations between players constantly. There always seems to be one player without the problem, he's usually top of the leader board. This phenomenom nessesitates the need to play only the servers/games that you dont crash/freeze/lag immediatly until the game picks you as host, then you can improve your K/D ratio, until then you have to get out quick because it's impossible to play. I have read countless reviews, seen countless YouTube videos, and talked with other players who have relentlously reported these problems to Activision. These problems are global and have been proclamed by all who play whether its Xbox, or PC (PC wholly the worst). The support from Activision or Infinity Ward whomever handles problems reported by players, is unresponsive. They already made their money, they're probably laughing all the way to the bank. I have a 75M up/ 35M down fiber connection and an Alienware 'built for speed, I7 6860HQ 3.6Ghz., 8 gig Ram, Nvidea GTX 780, etc... computer. I feel like I am being punished for investing in equipment for gaming. I dont nessesarily want an advantage (of course I do) over others just a fair gaming experience. I die in the game from players that arent on my screen yet, nobody is there, in an empty room, but the killcam showed him shooting me for seconds right in front of me, or I shoot him first, empty my gun into him, before he even sees me, then I die, the killcam shows him shooting me for 2 sec and my back was turned because he was 2 sec ahead in the game and I hadnt turned to shoot him yet, we were not even in the same game. I don't have this problem with other FPS games such as BattleField 4, Titan Fall (new) or Crysis. I also turn all the video options to their lowest settings but it doesnt matter even with a $600 GTX 780 card. I also see cheaters running rampant in way too many games, I finally found out that leaving the game an using 'F1' to look at 'friends' allows you to report the person, most people like me, for months, dont know how to report anyone. The cheats know this so they feel free. If you report them either nothing is done or the guy gets his Steam account reset then he goes back into the game and resumes cheating, these guys laugh at Activision and are open about the fact that they cant be stopped. You see people at presique 1 level 30 with a 'custom name' mopping everyone, obviously a reset player. Over and Over! How much can even a dedicated COD player endure? It's ridiculous. I hear many players talking about leaving COD for good and I am probably going to join them. This is what happens when a Company like Activision allows players to believe they don't care, maybe they became corrupt and greedy and started publishing unfinished games to the public. You cant convince me Activision couldnt fix these problems if they wanted to invest the time, they are capable, the answer must be they just don't care about us! The game is sold, it's over, time to move on and make more money. Don't get me wrong I like money too, Problem is.... I really loved this game! Perfect in fit for the player that wants a challenge. But not anymore! What a waste of a formerly capable game concept."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BAD NOBODY PLAYS THIS GAME LIKE 99.99% PRESENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME HATED IT............
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible. The game crashed in the beggining of No man land mission.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why so short
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Finally another Dead 2 Rights! Oh no, wait a second..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even after six months, multiplayer still lagging as hell and still have much cheaters in it. More than half servers are empty, the rest are almost empty.  I give this game 2 of 10 dogs.  Better buy/or play black ops 2. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,they game is a great addition to the call of duty series. the overall aspect of the game has been lowered. im a old time call of duty player and dont think this is a game to downgrade. the overall game play is just blan. i think there is much room for change and improvement. people arent accepting to change but change is need to make call of duty great again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"2.5/5 Addictive multiplayer still doesn't live up to its expectations, and the singleplayer is weaker than ever.  Pros: - Same Call of Duty addictiveness - Shares most of the traits from Black Ops II that made it successful  Cons: - Possibly the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest singleplayer I've ever experienced, with imbalanced difficulty levels and horrible story/voice-acting (-.5 because CoD is not known for its singleplayer) - Loaded with gimmicks from the trailer that do not have any effect on gameplay (dogs, 'underdog perspective', 'next-gen') - â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC optimization, DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A BELOW-NORMAL COMPUTER RIG "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Appauling game.  Single-player crashes after short periods of playtime (5mins) making it almost unplayable. Multiplayer crashes with a memory leak that almost takes down the whole system (frequently crashes other programs) after no more than 2 minuites of game time  Frames Per Second in-game is around 10, even on the menu (which doesn't have much going on) which, even if it wern't for the constant crashes, would make it unplayable.  Compare this to Battlefield 4 or even Battlefield 3, with much better visuals, significantly lower minimum system requirements (read: most people can actually play the damn game) and higher FPS and it doesn't crash as soon as you enter a game.  Hell, compare it to the last Call of Duty, Black Ops 2: The visuals are the same (even on maximum quality) -- there is *no* difference and yet it doesn't even play properly.  I would ask steam for a refund but they are a joke (once they have you're money it's not their problem).  Last played at the beginning of December 2013 (a good 2 months after release, with several patches that *haven't helped at all*) on a (i7 2600k @ 4.2Ghz, 16GB Ram, ATi HD6990 on Win7 64bit)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(This review is comming from a actuall Hater of the series)  I actually had a 'decent' expierience with this game i dont think it is a good COD but i can say for me it is not the worst game of 2013.  First of : The Singleplayer   It is ... good, i mean of course its COD that means its a linear Story but the Actually Story the game tried to tell you was great. And iam not talking about a 'Great for COD Standards Story' iam talking about a enjoyable story.  There was actual Characterdevelopment, cool Scenarios and a cool feeling put into this game and a awesome Cliffhanger for a Sequel.  Graphics: Its Bloody COD what do you expect ? it is not a Graphic Bomb but its acceptable and the Graphic Style actually looks awesome.  General Gameplay: The Movement and Weapons feel lighter and come close to F2P Shooter but it feels like a entire new COD or it actually doesnt feel like a COD and as a 29,99â‚¬ Game ... i would like it.  The Multiplayer:  Of course the most hated thing about the game was the Multiplayer because you died to easily and when you would respawn you would have the maximum of 3 Footsteps before you would die again. Simply because the Maps were a Clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, some of them were just to Small and annoying.  But i actually loved the Idea the Developers were going for, what you are noticing in this game is that Footsteps, Team Callouts are a big part of this Multiplayer, it was supposed to be a Shooter where you need to pay attention to your Surroundings because each step could be your last one.   Character Customization:  Ghosts is the first COD that lets you change the appearance of your Soldier/Soldiers, thats right, you can have more then one Character to play and each one Levels Up separately, but why would you want more Characters to LVL Up of you can have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of loadouts on only 1 ?  For the part i enjoyed the most the : Squad Mode  In this Additional Gamemode you can create a Squad out of all your Soldiers.  This allows you to compete against Squads of other Players and earn additional XP Boosts if your squad manages to pull over a fight while you are not even there to help it.  I actually like that System, creating your own Characters and play with them on your side on the Battlefield.  Extinction :  The new 'Zombie Mode' of COD now features Aliens and it is realy fun to play, thats actually all i can say about it i mean there are different Abilities you can choose from and its actually disapointing that for more Missions you need to buy the DLCs but all around ... the gamemode is fun.  The Community: Well its obvious that the COD Community is the worst and in a game that is called 'The worst of the series' it also is obvious that everyone is being a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about everything but that is not the Point iam going for.  I know that as a Player you want to go for the Stuff that is hard to get and take the best weapon in the game all over again but JESUS CHRIST !  The Usual squad you will come across is a Army of Bushes and everyone is using the AK-12 with the same Mods on each of them and its just ... realy annoying that no one wants Variation in their Squad, nope lets give everyone the same Equipment and Perks so they will have no variation, no balancing and so on.  It is not like that they are OP it is just annoying to see that in a game with so much Weapons ... everyone is using the same weapon and perks because it is 'The Best'.  But all around ... COD Ghosts wasnt that bad of a game ...   It is totally not worth its Money and plays like a F2P Shooter but it can be entertaining.  It shows what it wanted to be in the first place and it couldnt get out its full Potential but the Singleplayer,and we are talking about COD, the Singleplayer the 'Zombie Mode' and the new Squadmode were fun to play (Well for me, this is still my opinion)  The game had a good amount of potential but well ... this came out.  Again: Totally not worth its Money if it would be a 29,99â‚¬ Game it would be acceptable. It felt like a new COD like it or not it had aspects that other CODs didnt have. I had my fun with it and the little DLCs are actually quite worth their money.  I give a Call of Duty Ghosts a 6/10.  It was toootally not the worst game of 2013 and iam actually excited for a Sequel of this 'Timeline'      "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,2 dollars for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing camo -.- -100/1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hacking is the only thng fun in dis game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The most disappointing thing about the game is the lack of follow-through on what was promised by the developers. They promised dedicated servers. They didn't give them to us. They said that quickscoping wouldn't be possible in this game. It is. But the worst part of all are the hackers. People were hacking on the release date and there is no enforcement against the hackers. They have a button you can push to report a hacker, but they don't take steps to actually ban them. I saw someone with a nearly 30 kdr and reported them every time I saw them for weeks, but I still see them playing the game. Where is the follow-through?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is every bit the cash grab it appears to be, the single player is one gung ho patriotic circle jerk who's story is laughable at best, the multiplayer is an exercise in frustration as most matches boil down to camping trips, and the extinction mode should be relabeled to 'not trying to be any other wave based survival mode we swear, look there's aliens'. There is nothing redeeming about this game in any capacity, and that doesn't even include the performance. On my system which is running a GTX 780, an i7-3770k, and 10gb of Ram. The game experiences frequent micro stuttering, weird mouse issues, while providing a level of graphical fidelity that can only be described as lacking. While by this point they had tried to patch out some of the issues by adding an FOV slider in the multiplayer, no such improvement was implemented in the single player portion of this game. If you hadn't already made the mistake of buying this game, save yourself the headaches and avoid this game like the plague."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldn't get it even if it was free. Should have known it wouldn't be PC optimized nor player friendly.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't recommend it at all, lots of performance issues"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst thing since since cheese in a can. What a load of junk. cant believe I wasted my money on it. PLEASE PLEASE DONT BUY IT.. After a few hours completing the single player way to short. then a few hours of multi you will never switch it on again. too many hackers, slow play, freezes. too bad.. No more COD for me.. Only fish and chips.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One sentence can sum up this entire game 'We'll Stop Beating This Dead Horse When It Stops Spitting Out Money'  If That's Too long One word Bland Nuff Said  You want a full Review? Fine Call Of Duty:Ghosts Is a Generic Shooter With a Supposed 'Stealth' Aspect. Let me say Now. there is almost no stealth in the actual campaign (The thing I judge a game on most) And there is 0 Stealth in Multiplayer. I really dont have much to say about the singleplayer as if you blink, You miss it. But lets talk about the Multiplayer. The maps are Awful and boring, You constantly have hackers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing your game up, and lets say its less than noob friendly. It has Overpriced Dlc's (Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Serious a wolf skin for Â£4?) Useless weapon skins that cost way too much for an already Huge waste of cash, Awful Music, Players, Community (People May say the PAYDAY 2 Community is bad but i have met many awesome people on that and that is nothing compared to the idiots with a mic on this game), You canstantly get called 'Noob' 'â™¥â™¥â™¥' 'Hacker' etc etc. And if i could reset ANY Purchase it would be this one. Oh Also Games these days (This one in particular) Seem to trade Fun for RealismAnd that is just wrong. I dont play games to be a bored soldier who just wants to get home i want to play games for FUN Which is why i love games like shadow warrior 2013 and Serious Sam 3 BFE. But Yeah. ill finish off this wall of text now.  IN CONCLUSION! This game is a complete waste of money and no where near its AAA Cost in Fun value.  Fun&gt;Realism  -Lone Wolf"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,needs more players!!! direct x 11 only totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed this title
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"sudiced=BANNED. how do i know. well i did that, and you should know the rest"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is like a carrot top joke; only worse.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great singleplayer, but don't go for it if you want to play multiplayer. The community is done for, and consists mostly of campers. Not seen TOO many cheaters this time though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One multiplayer match was all I needed as a reminder to stay the hell away from this garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've owned this game since it came out. How many times have I played it? Really few. 'Why?', might you ask. Simple. It's AI sucks, HUD sucks, it isn't optimized for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it's online is bad. Plainly put. It's 'just another CoD game'. With little to no entertainment, boring maps, 'over-hyped extinction mode' which turned out to suck. Really? You guys need to put more effort into your games. 3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Alright, I'm sorry for my first review. I made myself look like an idiot by NOT listing anything I found wrong with it. I am sincerely sorry for the stupid review. I will revise it now. Pros: - Weapons are pretty cool-looking and are of decent variety. - The second mission of the campaign is decent. - Decent-looking camos. - The new Create-A-Soldier is a VERY good system. First, it allows players to make 10 totally unique soldiers (the first one is free, the second through fifth are 3 Squad Points each, in my case anyway) with their own weapon loadouts and each being prestige-able. Second, it allows players to play with any soldier they want to, whether it's one they've already prestiged (in that case, it would usually be for the sole purpose of getting more Squad Points to progress their low level soldiers easier) or a lowbie they're working on to get another prestige. - Nice variety of challenges to complete. Always gives you something to work towards. Cons: - Runs awfully on a computer that should run it on high-ultra with no problems. I can NOT stress this enough that this should be an immediate turn-off from the game. Don't believe me? Look up 'TotalBiscuit WTF Is Call of Duty: Ghosts' on YouTube and see what TB has to say about it. - Field of View is locked at 65 with no way to adjust the FoV without downloading and using a 3rd party hack to change it. I recommend FoVely and 80 FoV if you hate 65 FoV. - Game has a tendency to crash for no particular reason. - Cheaters (FoV-Changer users not included) make up a good 50-75% of the game's current population. This is INSANE with the amount of money and resources Activision and IW have at their disposal. - The developers (IW) were too lazy to actually make the copy-and-paste CoD we know Ghosts to be, so they hired multiple 3rd party developers (including Treyarch, Raven Studios [I think that's their name], and Sledgehammer Games) to do it for them. You can tell, too. - Requires a 28 GB install (was supposed to be 50 GB, but apparently that was a lie). What is the 28 GB for? Dog A.I.? - Developers have the guts to LIE directly to the PC community's face. I can easily think of 2 things they lied to us about. 1. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a next-gen experience, improving on everything CoD. FALSE. Ghosts actually plays worse than BO2 and WaW did (admittingly, WaW didn't play that badly, but enough that it was my 3rd least-favorite CoD in terms of gameplay), and BO2 was also quite bad. 2. Ghosts has the next-gen Anti-Cheat matched by nothing else. FALSE. There has been and will never be an anti-cheat of Ghosts. Even after at least 1-2 months, the game STILL has no anti-cheat. There were rumors of PunkBuster being integrated into Ghosts, but this was never confirmed and was never actually implemented. 3. CoD would have next-gen graphics. FALSE. The graphics look like they were from 2000. 4. Server browsers and servers. FALSE. They instead released it and only revealed that they lied and used a hybrid system, much like BO2's. If you played BO2, you know how bad it is, like I do. - Frequent stuttering.  Overall, NEVER buy this game. This game isn't even worth the 99-cent bin at stores like WalMart and Target. Oh, by the way, I forgot to add something that will help sway you. The MetaCritic review was a 78, more than BO2. The MetaCritic USER reviews were a 0.2 or 0.6, something like that. Hmm, the paid-off MetaCritics gave a game that was absolute CRAP a 78 and the USER reviews (the only reviews you should look at) were a 0.6. Anything suspicious?  By the way, I have around 110 hours on the Multiplayer and about 15 minutes on the Single Player. Sorry if this caused any confusion."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just full of bugs big disapointment
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's a simple shooter nothing complex...wondent recomended it for people who want a (REALLY) good game. Its a game for simple or 'idk what to do' kind of fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward promised us that the game would look the best on PC. The fact that the game takes up a total of 40gb of space and still looks the same as Modern Warfare 3 tells me that this was a lie. The texture is bad if you just take a little closer look. The system requierements are hillariusly bad and the game is not at all optmizied. You can look at my profile and see my PC's specs, and even then I have frequent FPS drop and lag often.  Options! There is ONE slider for audio, ONE! This is not acceptable. FoV slider? Nope, why the hell would we be given that.  IW forces people to camp in order to unlock different kind of skins for the weapons, which is very, VERY bad.  So, do not buy this game. You'll end up raging and destroying whatever is around you. Stick with Black Ops 2 if you have it or go over to Battlefield 4 for the duration of 2014."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"after bo2 this game looked liked sh+t to me ,campaign is not bad but it is not worth to 60 dollars 1-dlc's are coming pc 1 month later(not a big deal) 2-there are hackers in every lobby(the game is just released) 3-when you report a hacker they are not banning(they are not pay attention to hackers - in bo2 my friend is hacked and banned immediately) 4-lag issues are not fixed(im laggin) 5-game looks like previous game and previous two and three 6-we cant put clan name before our names(unlike xbox and playstation so we are changing our steam names) but we are paying same money to infinity ward) and im lagging and i cant play ghosts in a fu'ki'g very low quality i am not recommend this game to anybody ,dont buy it ,just wait for new cod"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible performance this game is probably the worst game in the cod franschise!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is probably the WORST COD made. 1. It was ported very poorly to the PC 2. Although I don't really mind graphics, they promised a new gen type feel to it but damn they failed. 3. The gameplay is very dull and generic, and WTF is extinction, seriously IW...  Bad game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"MW2 with new maps and 3 times the hackers...............More Lies from DEVS, NO DEDICATED SERVERS ONLY IW BS NETWORK. I Truely Want to file a Class Action Suite on this one for anti trust, we trusted their word for dedicated servers and got diddly squat. We have tweeted promises of Dedicated Servers. Forced Lobbies after their last patch make it UN-PLAYABLE!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This mfr and Steam let hackers rule and run rampant. It's a shame that you pay over 100 USD for a game with updates and you get little support from the company and Steam. Not to mention the management of the game stated there would be dedicated servers. This is a complete false statement. It's 100% peer to peer. I for one will never, ever buy another COD game that is sold and managed through Steam. $$$ is all they care about. They made a billion dollars on the opening day of release and they can't spend any time or money on making the game fare for all honest paying customers. VAC is a complete waste. I can not recommend enough not to buy this game, any Steam game, and and COD game for any platform. They don't support the product properly and will not give a refund once contect has been released. Save your money!!! :)  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's the badest game call of duty game ever. it's look like call of duty modern warefare with a dog wtf ? not buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cool storyline, but Infinity Ward did a bad job at converting the game. Underdeveloped, and much is left unfinished."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No will to fold the hacker. Check any game from pwn. Blatant aim boot and wall hacking and he still doesn't get banned. IW just want you money and sell you recycled map from older version for 15$ a pop.   Put some effort in preventing hacker. Enforce the law of phisycs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Although the game is not bad and still fun to play. I cannot recommend this to anyone, considering its price tag. There are not lot of innovations to be found. The graphics might look better, but its gameplay is no different from COD:MW series. The single player even taking a step backward from Black Ops 2. You can no longer customize your weapons nor making a choice like you did in Black Ops 2. The campign is just straight forward like what it was in MW series. The multiplayer new modes are not working that well either."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Mulitplayer of this Call Of Duty It sucks so much. Only decent thing in this game is extinction. This game is totally not worth $60.00 you don't get your money's worth.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game crashes and the servers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t up.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Plays like â™¥â™¥â™¥ even on high end PC's. Don't Play this bad PC port.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game is sucks Rly sucks OMG i buy it For 60$ Without any dlc And now Its 60$ With 3 Dlc  - Don't Buy this Game guys its sucks Alot of lagg And there is some hackers In the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. don't get it its poo.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've had the game for three months and havn't been able to play it. Last week I bought a new computer with 12 GIG of RAM. I can play the game for 30 seconds and then it crashes.   How can a company get away with selling trash like this? It's almost criminal.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A while back a wrote a good review of this game. Now... I HATE IT!!!! the game itself is fun, if you can play it that is! this game has so many issues, it's not even worth Buying. Call of Duty was slowly but surely getting worse and worse (Except for Blacks Ops, atleast Trey Ark was trying to be different and inovative and still has plenty of potential with Black Ops) but this game just put the last nail in the Coffin for Infinity Wards Franchis of Call Of Duty. DO NOT BUY!!! WORST CALL OF DUTY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recomend Trey Arks Call Of Duty: Black Ops and Black Ops 2 over this piece of crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After more then 800 hours of gameplay I think I'm entitled to have an opinion of the game.  This is my first COD ever and after a couple of 100 hours people people stopped calling me a noob. I got promoted to wallhacker, cheater, camper, thermalnoob, and I bet I forgot a couple of other titles. I'm not even as good as some I've met and playing wiith. Around 25 kills per game seems to be the standard for me now. The game itself is fun. During all the hours I've met very nice people (and still playing together), but also very nasty (12 year old) people without any sense of moral, wallhackers pinghackers, aimbotters, etc. That's life I guess.  Like I said, the game itself is fun, without the cheating b.a.s.t.a.r.d.s, but it's dead! We all know who to blaim!  IW/Activision really knows how to rip people off. Holders of the seasonpass don't get any DLC. There arent a lot players on new maps, because nobody is going to buy it anymore.  People please, don't get tempted. More then 10.000 people stopped playing the game due to hackers. IW/Activision didn't care and now see the result. This game is dying. Less then 6K players (max) each day and getting les by the week!!!! Not kidding. IW promised deticated servers, but untill today nothing! The PC version is a rip-off-clone from the XBOX, not optimized for the PC.  AGAIN: DON'T GET TEMPTED TO BUY THE DLC's NOR THE GAME! (you really are robbing yourself if you do)  EDIT: Last night (30th of March 2014) at 2AM there where only 2077 persons online. Since they add the DLC maps into the rotation-system, there is less change you get into a game when you are with a group. &lt;-- Thank you IW!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst CoD to date. I regret buying this sooo much.  The story is ridiculous and unoriginal and has been for the latest CoD games, the last good story being Modern Warfare 2. Maybe not good story but fun campaign. Predictable, unoriginal, not fun at all.  Multiplayer is real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The new squad thing is cool, sure. But the AI is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good that not even me, a seasoned CoD veteran with 700-ish hours over Xbox and PC can't get good stats against AI even when playing my absolute best. They see you from unreal distances, they can just be standing somewhere waiting for you because they know where you're coming. Sniping against bots is also impossible. If you're standing in a window across the map in multiplayer, no one can see you unless they get killed by you so they know where you are. Bots, however, see you regardless of how little of your model you expose and shoot you down with laser accuracy. The only thing about squads is that you can try to play a little casually and still get squad points (the 'currency' used in create a class and to unlock new squad mates) but they take such an outrageous amount of time that it's not worth playing squad mode and getting 1 point every 3 matches and needing 12 to unlock that weapon you want so you end up playing crappy, unbalanced, classic Infinity Ward unplayable multiplayer instead. Snipers camping all the time, people running around with SMGs and superhero reflexes and hawk eyes and you're just running around not knowing where anyone is and all the sudden you get shot in the head and don't know what happened.  Really, DO NOT buy this game. It's horrible, it's the worst CoD game to date. Every aspect of the game is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you want a generic CoD game then buy Modern Warfare 3 instead. 40â‚¬ I'll never get back for this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'I HATE GHOSTS, I HATE GHOSTS I AM DONE, THIS GAME NEEDS TO DIE I HATE GHOSTS, I HATE GHOSTS ITS TIME TO SAY GOODBYE WE ALL HATE  YOUR LAME â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME THE GRAPHICS ARE BALLS' ~ The8ThHawk"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I stop buying CoDs after BO2 got this as a gift. Huge dissapointmen crawling on my skin. Three words: DO NOT BUY! If you don't get it as a gift, like I did ;)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single Player is fine but MP Is just a laggy stuttry mess even now.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst C.O.D ever !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pure buggy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 0.5/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why did I buy this? I hear the screams of 'We didn't listen!' echoing constantly through my skull. I excede the recommended requirements, yet even when running with everything low/off, this game runs like ****....I am now going to retire into solitude. comtemplating what could have urged me to commit to this at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"cod ghosts is a terrible piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who deserves the top 1 worst video game of 2013.  due to awful frame rate. the game needs only gtx 550. and if much more. it's due to awful framerate   the game anti-aliasing is horrendous. fxaa = ps2 game even on the highest it looks like my â™¥â™¥â™¥ after â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it too many times. what makes it funnier comparing this to bf4 is a terrible idea. even bf4 worked better... bf4 was a good game at the end. this one ? nope. awful singleplayer with terrible ending. multiplayer full with 6 year old kids. and terrible graphics to make u feel cheated by the worst company ever named activision.   DON'T, NEVER, STAY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AWAY   1/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What a Pile of Horse Hay!!!!! Never again Will I buy another infinity ward crap.. still no dedicated server for us to rent. Still full of hackers. The Only best part up to now is Extinction.. And the next DLC looks crap too... No more cash off me... I would rather pay for unlimited Zombies if Trearch did one. Never again will I buy their crap.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible game, same graphics as MW3. Brokenfield 4 is better because the game actually works. Multiplayer is broken and terrible and very unrealistic. Controls can suck my â™¥â™¥â™¥ and campaign story is terrible. Never buying COD product again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get borred very quickly, bots, bots bots bots. Singleplayer was very dull unlike older version of COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY! This game runs TERRIBLE even on a high-end rig.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crap crap and more crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS GAME IT SUCKS I AM TALKING ABOUT (MULTIPLAYER) NEVER TRIED SINGLEPLAYER BUT IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME IT IS SO BAD I WISH I COULD GET A REFUND DONT BUY IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY I REPET DO NOT BUY ITS LIKE A GAME TOKEN A GAINT PILE OF $HIT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is like taking a poop, except I enjoy taking poops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Call of duty not verry good i expect alot more then that really !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"An absolute abomination to COD, performance issues, lag, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ campaign and squads mode, still doesn't work 8 monthes after launch. my recommendation is go get a better game that is actually worth the money, COD Ghosts is Toast."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Piece of sh*t!Don't buy this!!!Stick to BO2 if you can!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst PC game I've ever played...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game seemed exiting at first, but its extremely hard to control"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I hate this game. its for fagets
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is fun but as usual it's still the same ol' Call of Duty we have been playing for years. The graphics are decent but seems to have issues with certain settings even on a high end system.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst singleplayer plot ever and empty,awkard multiplayer. Stay away"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Oh my god I hated this game so much I tried to hack it but it didn't work but then a couple days later I think VAC detected me when I hated it so much and thats why I got banned. But really, this game is bad because HORRIBLE PC SUPPORT super laggy and I have a good PC so you can't say its my computer. It was fixed later but still, gold camo looks gross, the unlock challenges for it are super hard and not fun (Ex. 30 leaning around a corner kills), maps are huge and so slow, EVERYTHING IS GRAY, and kids dressed up as astronauts are running around the map. The only good thing was the campaign. It was OK."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Typical call of duty material. Not a lot of inspiration to this one.  It has the most irritating escort mission ever. You can't even shoot the dog to shut up it's incessant whining. Your team stand around demanding you pick up the dog in the middle of a firefight. Then they don't ever advance ahead of you, as if they expect you to pick up the dog and run ahead of the team with your arms full of dog rather than rifle. Do they think enemies will be merciful because you're holding annoying wounded dog or something? The only mercy is to shoot you in the head at that point. So indeed, they are merciful.  It also seems like they're trying desperately hard to include unusual weapons at this point. All sorts of obscure guns in here, but none of them are notably interesting.   The tank control and A-10 control scenes had potential to be awesome, but they just didn't have a good feel to them. The tank sped around like it was a toy not a 60-ton war machine, the A-10 just didn't have enough exposure time.  Actual good points: The space combat, underwater combat and train combat scenes were interesting. They were a little bit new and the few moments where I was briefly impressed in this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME! IS SO SO SO BAD! I'm lucky i didnt pay 60 $ for this as i got it on sale but this game doesnt even deserve to be given for free!  An 8gb ram requirement?! Like WTF If steam is reading this please sue the guys who made this and save your face instead promote battlefield 4 that is the only multiplayer shooter perfectly playable right now. Finally for all the amateurs still going for this grow a pair and move on -_- #SHAME #INFINITYWARD Peace out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i thought the game was crap and have somthing to say to infinity ward stick to somthing you are good at 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"for whatever reason when i redownload this fine piece of art i expect it to be good. unfortunately, THE GAME IS CRAP. it runs like crap, it plays like crap, ITS JUST BAD  12/10 would uninstall again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game was not fun at all.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the worst game of the year
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Although it was really short the campaign (For once) was actually better than the multiplayer, however not worth the cash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player game is awesome as usual. The multi player game is as bad as it gets. So many times I can hit an enemy point blank in the face with a shotgun and then when they are done reloading their gun or done ordering pizza they kill me with one hit. This is if it is vs. other players or vs. bots in the squad play. You also don't get to pick the maps you want to play on. The game looks nice but no destroyable structures. I have been playing COD since the first one and this is the worst or tied for worst with Modern Warfare 2 in my opinion.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Still a 4 hours single player campaign. More enjoyable than previous titles (despite having the dog 'feature' for all of 15 minutes in the entire game. WTF?!). Wait for it on sale - comes to about the same price per hour as a movie ticket.  Otherwise... meh. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First of all, this game is dead. If you are thinking about buying it, don't. I bought it back in February of this year, I had it on Xbox 360, Xbox One and Playstation 3 so I was familiar with the game. Since I switched to PC gaming, I wanted to have this game too. I bought it very cheap, 20 euro's for the game plus season pass (normal price was 99 euro's), now I know why it was that cheap.  Back in February there were only around 5K people online, well, if I tell you that on each console, there are mostly 10K+ people around (depends on the console and the day you play it, obviously). So that was quite a bummer for me. After creating a class as a level 1 nooblet, I wanted to finally play a game. 'Hmmm, let's start with Search and Destroy, a very calm gamemode and good to learn the controls.' (Since I was not that familiar with PC gaming back then) I said to myself. Hovered with my mouse over the gamemode. 'Players in gamemode 0'. What. The. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Okay, let's see for other gamemodes then... Kill Confirmed, 0, Search and Rescue, 0, Infected, 0. Alrighty then, well, seems like there are only three options. Team Deathmatch, Free For All and a 24/7 playlist with a specific map that should change X days/weeks. It's June now and it's the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing map still (no way it's coincidence). Welp.  So, almost a half year later and guess what? 5K became 700 people, seven-hundred people. 400+ in Team Deathmatch and a few in FFA and 24/7 Playlist, so still the same issue. The only positive thing about this game is that, in comparisson with Modern Warfare 3, there are almost no hackers/cheaters. Well, since there are only 700 people in the game, I can see why that is.  I'm going to end this review the same way I started it, it's dead. Do not buy, even if it's cheap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not my favourite of the Call of Duty Franchise. I'd still prefer the Modern Warfare 3 engine. The singleplayer experience was great, however the multiplayer is filled with numerous amounts of hackers that seemingly don't get dealt with by the VAC System."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'I HATE GHOSTS, I HATE GHOSTS I AM DONE, THIS GAME NEEDS TO DIE I HATE GHOSTS, I HATE GHOSTS ITS TIME TO SAY GOODBYE WE ALL HATE  YOUR LAME â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME THE GRAPHICS ARE BALLS' ~ The8ThHawk"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT buy this game if you want to have fun. In this Call of Duty, Infinity Ward showed us that they can't make multiplayer. Worse Call of Duty ever made. It is my opinion."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's a simple shooter nothing complex...wondent recomended it for people who want a (REALLY) good game. Its a game for simple or 'idk what to do' kind of fun.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad game dont buy. Why you ask ok NEW GAME less content do the math more does not = more its less when it comes to Call of duty.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very poorly optimized for PC, had to buy it on xbox because I couldn't get 30 frames on the lowest settings... (Not my system, I get 120 frames on BO2)  Would honestly like refunded for this, its un-playable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I had never played any Call of Duty games before and being the good ol' gamer I am, I talked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about Call of Duty. Then one day, I got Call of Duty: Ghosts as a gift from one of my friends. I thought; well, I've never tried it before and maybe I might like it. 5.4 hours later, I STILL will talk â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about Call of Duty.       Pros: -Can rush in and knife enemies -Interesting story line   Cons:  -Can rush in and knife enemies -Ending that is only put in so they can make a sequel -Mowing down waves of enemies long range with a sub-machine gun -A F#$%ING AUTO RELOADING WIRELESS SNIPER RIFLE -Clunky controls -Very average animations  Wouldn't recommend paying $50+ for this game, if you really want it, get it on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a great game, however it's very short. I completed it in 7.8 hours and I'm not good at FPS shooters. Good game, bad value for money. (this is purely the single player campaign review. Multiplayer may be awsome, I have no idea). If the game was Â£15 I would give it 5 stars."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,10hours download install when advanced warfare took about 6hours gg.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont waist your money on this.. It is so laggy and it crashes.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD game by my Opinion. About Multiplayer Ill better Shut Up Because i have no comments about this . If you want Waste your money or you Big Fan of COD You Can buy this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game overall... No PC player base whatsoever for multiplayer, bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t of you ask me. Im getting sick of this damn series dying within two â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in months of release. And then stil want you to pay over $50 dollars for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage. Go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourselves, better yet, quit destroying games and go stick thumb tacks up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ and work at mcdonalds instead. Thats how I feel."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game sucks overall, the graphics looks like someone threw sand in my helmet, the multiplayer is laggy and bad, the weapons are crap, the singleplayer sucks.  also no ghosts  also only one use of controlable dog  0/10 would not ghost again - IGN"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I encountered a pretty much game breaking bug in the 'Factory' level, where the team reaches an emergency exit door. The second it's about to open, the game crashes without fail, every time, making the game incompletable. I've tried loading the game on other computers, reinstalling, validating, everything I can think of.   That's quality control for you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst COD Multiplayer we have seen.    Time to kill is too fast. Thus all gun fights are over before they begin and obviously the best way to deal with this is to camp. Hence the servers are empty.   The graphics are terible even on the highest settings. They look at least 7 years old. Hit detection is good but weapons are the same old dull guns as before.   All in all a terrible Multiplayer game. The single player is basic and boring also. I played over 100 Hours of multiplayer.   5/10...A very poor game and a massive let down. The people who made it simply did not care and were lazy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First Multiplayer game: loses connection Second Multiplayer game: It was okay. Third Multiplayer game: crashed at the end, and the game is now currently unplayable. Won't even open. I enjoyed the campaign, you get you play underwater and in space which is pretty badass. I wouldn't recommend buying this game for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The impersonated Downfall of the Modern FPS.  This Game does literally EVERYTHING possible to make you frustrated. Everythign a publisher or Developer CAN do wrong, has been done wrong. All the things we comsumers like to complain about on a AAA Title are included, adn of course, overcharged.  Examples? Uhm Yeah , why not.  -Literally No positive Innovations. entire Cutscenes have been reused from a previous CoD, 1:1, only reskinned to make the modles show the proper characters. it is entirely recycled Bulls*** from previous Games. Even the DLC delivers recycled Multiplayer Maps from previous games.  Balancing? What? One of the Best Balanced Multiplayer Shooters of all time (CoD1-2) has literalyl become a fragfest for those, who cant shoot. want to be the elitary Pro in a Multiplayer match? You dont even have to cheat. aAll u gotta do is throw infinite GExplosives around you, wil spamming the whole map with totalyl overpowered killstreaks, the kills you gain through them result in what? Of course in even MORE Overpowered Killstreaks. And since its ActiBlizzs Target to Sell 2 Copies of CoD to every Household.  No matter if youre an Armless mann, a Blind Grandma or a Little fat kid with a Few missing Chromosomes, or even a Dog or a Goldfish - Don't worry! Sledgehamemr Guarantees you that there will be some totally Insane gadget included in the Game, Which makes any other player in the Game just as bad as you are. because at the end of the game, the player didn't actually win. The Machines took over the Earth, and Killstreaks, helicopters and awkwardly intelligent tripmines, that follow you over the whole map, bouncing, flying and shooting while exploding multiple times.  No seriously. You actualyl dont even have to fire your gun anymore to win, because there will be some helicopter, VTOP, Low Orbital Ion Cannon or Half-Machine-Half-Sheepdog Hybrid that will kill the scum for you when youre too dumb for yourself.  Holy F!#*Â§ again an all new next generation graphics engine? Wow, those Guys at IW/Treyarch/Sledgehammer must been coding the flying F*** out of the game. Uhm, Nope. Actually, the every-year-all-new-fancy-next-gen-graphics is still the same engine and source code like call of Duty 1. and i mean, ONE. not Modern Warfare one, the FIRST CoD from 2003. so its practically the classical Quake Engine, also used in stone-old games like Forsaken, daikatana, heavy Metal F.A.K.K. and even the goldsrc engine from the first half life based on the same source code. so this isnt even ancient anymore, its just a stone old computer code relic from the late 90s/early 2000s, Stuffed up with not so fancy plugins. And guess what? thats the reason CoDs actualyl not even average graphics eat so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ much performance. the system requirements are insane, the Low performacne even with a high end system unfixable, and the most textures (look at the floor textures DUDE!!!) are mostly still from 2004.   The Maps. the quality of Maps in CoD was once amazing, even without the great community maps. but since community made maps are no longer wished, and the quality of the dev-made maps goes to zero, i would rather play in an empty box.  Oh. My. God. The Netcode. matchamking is horrible. No Skill Groups, No Chance to play DLC because theres always someone who hasnt gotten the map,  lag, disconnects, breakdowns, the game actually giving you a virtual higher ping to balance players with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ connections. dude, when i had a bad connection back in years, i was just joning another server. you might say its the second worst netcode i have ever seen. Still topped by the ever-disconnecting, never connecting CnC generals. but at least hat was the only flaw of that game.  Oh and did i mention the batshit insane â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up community?  every Session consists, in fact, of  12 yo Russian kid voicespamming the lobby cheaters rotaten with aimbot like a helicopter. a dude that has never played the game before. adn proably never will again. That lifeless guy that calls you a noob, everytime he kills you, and a cheater, everytime you kill him. The Troll/Griefer who just treis to break thehorrible game experience even more, no idea why. a raging nerd that tells you that your whole loadout is so nooby, and you shouldnt play with that gun coz its so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ overpowered. Oh, and probably one dude that unites all the aboce listed characters in one.  Yep, 60 Bucks, Plus the Same again for all the DLCs, which you dont even play, because after buying the last DLC theres no one left to play the game because it splits up the players to servers for any DLC.. oh, and they also have already preordered the next release of CoD so you gotta get moving anyway.   The Most Embarassing game i have ever bought.  should have shoved the Disc including the Retail Box up my â™¥â™¥â™¥ for spending a single cent for that crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,what i didn't like from this game is a grapic not good... i can't see enemy from a long range.. i just see enemy i near my posision anyway the story is good..  enjoy the game ^_^
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not recommended. Nothing new.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible game. Do not buy! Worst COD ever made!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BEWARE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!  This game is the worst in CoD history. First of all, the graphics suck. The game has some sort of grey filter over all of the textures to make it bland. The lack of polygons make it look like a 360 game port. CoD is usually ok with performance (Gigabyte GTX 970 4Gb) and I can barely play this game without it microstuttering and random FPS drops.  The TTK is EXTREMELY fast like 2 nanoseconds, and almost every gun feels the same. You have almost no time to react. whoever has the better connection will win any gunfight.  I want my $60 back."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want to play the campaign don't it's just god awful. If you want to play the Multiplayer don't it's a campers paradise. If you want to uninstall the game, and save your sanity don't worry about it because you already lost it when you purchased the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought this for $30. Best $30 ive ever wasted.  10/10 would waste money again.  But in all seriousness if you want this game go and get yourself the console and purchase this game as on the computer it is just... I cant even describe how glitchy and bad it is..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Usual Call of Duty experience.  Be guy. Something happening to said guy. Another guy is in charge of guy. Guy goes to roller coaster style combat. Guy sees tree, wants to explore. Guy held back by invisible wall. Guy sad. Guy goes on missions to fight fake armies based on real nations. Guy finds himself in too deep. Guy ends up in bad situation. Guy sees bad stuff happening. Guy gets out of situation Guy swears vengeance, carries on with more operations to exact said vengeance. Guy operates until end of game. Guy mad because it ends in cliffhanger."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just played less than an hour into singleplayer and right off the bat it shows how outdated the graphics and the game engine is. If they're going to sell a game with an outdated game engine graphics, I shouldn't have to pay $60 for it. It's a good thing I didn't and instead paid less than $20 retail. One should get it when the price drops below $20. I didn't try multiplayer because I've been told to stay away from it due to cheaters and trolls."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Kill it! Kill it with fire!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No anti cheat no dedi servers tbh its a long list. In short its a realy realy bad port. Dont waste youre money on this piece of u know what. And if u do want it il trade it you for awesomenauts and payday 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great singleplayer, but don't go for it if you want to play multiplayer. The community is done for, and consists mostly of campers. Not seen TOO many cheaters this time though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Story Mode works just fine but I can't join any multiplayer games... Only 195 players online for this game, dissapointing!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,from what i played of the campaign it's a generic call of duty campaign but it has a space mission so  the multiplayer has abysmal netcoding that makes it near impossible to play on PC  also it's essentially dead on PC
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, so lets start with this that this is the worst call of duty game for the pc(maybe for the consol too). The game have ahit port and fill f2p game taht cost 60$. The loadout system not bad and not good for my opinion. Too big maps. It was my first cod game to i dont know what more to say. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There was a recurring Monty Python sketch where a group of middle-aged women would announce that they were going to reenact some famous historical event, but every single event was represented by a hilarious speeded-up handbag fight in a muddy field. I find myself reminded of it with the Call of Duty series; every time I think it's gonna do something else for once, it blows a whistle and everything descends into squeals and handbag-slapping.  Case in point, CoD: Ghosts. Not only is it not a game about the vengeful spirits hanging around English chip shops, but it's also not the game it purports to be in its own intro sequence. The Ghosts, as the name might imply, are ostensibly a legendary stealth unit that specializes in taking down larger forces through sneaky guerrilla tactics. So obviously, one of the first things you do in the game is ram-raid an enemy base in a burning truck and start gunning down every living thing from the dandelions on upwards. Yeah, that's some good ghostin' there, lads! Truly, thou art akin to the flicker of a candlelight shadow as you waddle around an open field being shot at from nineteen different directions.  The other thing I gathered ahead of time was that the plot would be about a weakened U.S. fighting a superior foe, which would make a nice change from the usual case wherein the heroes jump all over vastly inferior foes for floating the idea that maybe the U.S. could stop eating all the pancakes for five minutes. So here's the sitch: the U.S. has been invaded by all of South America. OK, gonna have to stop you there, Call of Duty: Ghosts; I get that all of your plots are birthed from the fantasies crossing the mind of a paranoid, xenophobic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥wit as he has violent grunting sex with a pile of damp moss, but at least you used to stick to foreigners who potentially are enemies of the U.S., and South America has better things to do with its time than sit around shaking its fist at your freedoms all day, at least as long as association football exists!  Anyway, they attack America by hijacking America's orbital missile weapon. OK, gonna stop you there again, Ghosts! Firstly, so much for the enemy being 'superior' if they can't make their own superweapons and gotta pinch 'em like safari park baboons nicking the windscreen wipers. And secondly, orbital â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing missile weapon!? This invasion is sounding more justifiable by the second! 'Cause not only is the U.S. outsourcing their weapons development to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Megatron, but they also appear to have exterminated every single member of their population who isn't a burly white dude.  Just for fun I kept a running tally of all the characters in the story campaign who aren't burly white dudes and you are under no obligation to shoot. The final total was three: a female astronaut right at the start who immediately dies, a helicopter that spoke with a woman's voice, and a black member of the Ghosts unit who immediately dies. And, frankly, when that happens, the main characters displayed less emotion than when their dog got shot. 'Dammit, the black guy died!', they seemed to say, 'Now we can't claim to have tons of black friends while arguing on the internet!'  You are one of two burly white brothers whose burly white dad has been secretly testing them over the years to make them worthy of joining the Ghosts, it never having occurred to him that they might prefer to become pastry chefs or something. The main baddie turns out to be a burly white friend of the burly white dad who was captured by the enemy and turned to their side. Damn South Americans! It's not enough for them to steal our orbital doomsday satellites, they have to start harnessing the power of our burly white dudes as well!  Also, there's a dog. A German Shepherd, the burliest and whitest of all the dogs, who was a bit of unique selling point in the lead-up: he'll run out and savage South Americans at your command because he's been fed on an exclusive diet of neck-shaped burritos. And there are missions where you play as the dog, and finally get to do some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ghosting as you sneak around the long grass internally debating the choices at the throat buffet. I was gonna bring up Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, but that might be too cosmopolitan a reference for this game.  All of which would have had more of an impact if the dog got to be in more than two levels before the game goes 'Right, hope you got your money's worth!' and sends him to the time-out kennel forever. Not that I was expecting him to tag along for the scuba diving bit, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing as that would've been, but the fact is his role in the game is just another momentary gameplay gimmick. It would've been nice if he'd had some kind of personality besides being just another piece of military hardware for the armchair generals to masturbate over. Although, the same could be said of the human characters!  Speaking of hardware, there are the standard apocalyptic coffee break sequences, where you pull out a remote from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dimension and rain predator drone death down on an enemy unable to in any way defend themselves or fight back. And d'you know what? I don't see how I'm supposed to have any grasp of the relative enemy threat when we may or may not be packing armfuls of superweapons we forgot to mention. Like after the enemy base ram-raid, I'm told to pick off the stragglers with the robot sniper. Hold on a second, when did we set up a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing robot sniper? What did we bring it here in? How did we set it up without the enemy noticing; did we disguise it as a badger-watching station?  Incidentally, the Ghosts are well-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing-equipped for a guerrilla unit. 'Oh, no, America has been attacked and is weakened and there's no defenses except an inexhaustible supply of tank battalions and an army of killer robots. And we would've had a doomsday satellite if the rest of the world hadn't gotten all weird about it!' Which they were entirely right to be because when the player wrestles control of the satellite back at the end, they immediately use it to wipe hundreds of thinking, feeling blips off the map as casually as one were to use a windscreen wiper on a rainy day!  Yet again, it seems like they cut out every moment in the story that could've built context but didn't have any explosions in it. And if they hadn't added voiced plot-dumps to the loading screens, the experience would've been as coherent as scrambled porn intercut with the fantasies of Tea Party members. And 'fantasy' really is the word; the vehicles all handle like turbo-boosted magic carpets, lest anything requiring actual skill get in the way of your unpleasant paranoid battle-glory daydream, so divorced from reality it might as well be taking place in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Narnia!  So however you might have expected a game called Ghosts to differ from the modern shooter routine of meaningless violence and empty spectacle, you were wrong, ya idiot! But somehow it's only getting worse! Black Ops II actually came across as at least slightly self-aware, and Modern Warfare (One) went so far as being profound, such as in that bit where you die slowly and horribly in a nuclear blast. If that happened in CoD: Ghosts, you'd probably just fart all the radiation out in one big heroic guff, pull the broken glass out of your eyeballs and then use it to shiv the Ayatollah. - Yahtzee"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,wasted 15 on a game that doesnt even work! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cod has not been good since mw2.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I gave up on multiplayer after 1 month. Waste of time and my hard earned money. Laggiest game ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would give 4/10 but cause of the dog i give 0/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just the worst unplayable game i have EVER PLAYED DONT BUY THIS THIS JUNK!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Let's not lie to ourselves here, this is the worst CoD by far. You would be better off just giving 50$ to a homeless guy off the street. I'd rather commit sudoku than ever play a dog sequence in this game again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really disappointed with this game. Finished the solo mission and gameplay within 6 hours. The multiplayer won't connect and when it does, it keeps crashing or losing connection. Really wish I could get my money back for this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Was alright upon release, then cheating got as bad as MW3 is now, got about 80hours in before it got terribly bad... quit playing for over a year, came back and found I was game banned.  Guess they were just saving me the hassle of uninstalling again. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY! This game runs TERRIBLE even on a high-end rig.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucked the weapons were lame as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ along with the game play. Big waste of money!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get borred very quickly, bots, bots bots bots. Singleplayer was very dull unlike older version of COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why on earth would you make a game that is made for 6GB of RAM... I've heard that other PC users have ran it great. YOU DO NOT NEED the ADDITIONAL 2GB RAM to run this game.  Furthermore, this game is a pile of crap. Not only does the multiplayer mode lag, but the MENUS lag too...  Infinity Ward... If you want to kill a perfectly good Call of Duty series... Then go ahead..  Otherwise I think you should QUIT while your ahead of your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would NEVER reccomend this game to anybody because of muliple reasons. They only just added a FOV slider when it was released in November and it only branches upto 80 when a external programmes can reach upto 100 but now you can be banned for using it. Its graphics are outdated and when compared to other games it looks older than it should. They havent put any other Sound settings in the game.  The new sniper scope systems gives a FPS drop when used so a Acog would become somehow better than a normal scope, and FPS drops on some maps happen frequently and there is no fix. If you run the game on high settings the graphical quality is what you would expect from a outdated game.   Extinction mode is a somewhat fun and boring mode to play because you can get immersed rather quickly but the shine of this new mode rubs of as a attempt to challenge Treyarch's Zombies mode and provide more fun but is more confusing than the crazy world of Zombies.  And as i guess you have seen already NOBODY likes this game. To be honest it isnt really a game it is just a way of taking money from what might of been loyal customers. I play this game still just to burn time when I am bored out of my mind, also they put false System Specifactions for the game.  Never buy a Infinity Ward Title ever again!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought this game on steam, and guess what? LAGG all over the DAMN place! WHAT A BAD BAD BAD BAD GAME THIS IS!  Don't buy this crap serious! You're just wasting your damn money! I tried all the lagg fixes and all the same crap over and over again. At the end of the day it turns out that my system is BOSS and this game really sucks. I don't have 3GB video memory and a 8 core processor to run this game on low and even then i have the most worst lagg ever. The game is TOTALLY unplayable!  The worst part is that after serveral email to activision they send me to steam to refund my money. and guess what? Steam DON'T give your money back!! RIDICULOUS! Turns out you paid your hard worked money on a game that don't works and you get backraped by steam in your back! They just GRAB your money and you have a unplayable game.   Even today this game is STILL in the Steam Store?! WHY PEOPLE? WHY? Just to make money! Don't buy this crap. It's 60 euro waste of money and a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  STEAM please do me a favor and DELETE this game from the market, it's just ridiculous why are you guys selling a game to the masses that sucks bigtime! NO COMMENT! shame on YOU! I NEVER had answers on my email. The only thing i get back is SORRY sir we understand the problem but we can't give you're money back. Look on youtube for CoD: GhostS! Millions of people bought this game on steam and received the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!   I'm waiting steam, give me my money back!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a complete joke to PC gaming history. I knew CoD was bad, but this is beyond bad. Its not CoD Ghosts, its CoD Toasts. The servers feel like its running on a toaster. The game is very low optimised and just wasn't as good as it looked to be. This doesn't even get to be compared with BF4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"stay away from this game!!! or if you are an hacker please enjoy the game!!! ....................../Â´Â¯/)  ....................,/Â¯../  .................../..../  ............./Â´Â¯/'...'/Â´Â¯Â¯`Â·Â¸  ........../'/.../..../......./Â¨Â¯\  ........('(...Â´...Â´....

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this first time i buy COD Series, i play others series from my friends, and i think i can get some FUN. i buy Preorder, and upgrade my PC to meet their system requirement, but still this game BUGGY as HELL!  i wait almost half years, hope they fix this port, but they never do. They even disc this game 50%!!! but never fix the problem, i spend money to game which i cannot play.  this game already get too many hackers, who can enjoy game like this? Buggy, Many Hacker, Not FUN  already wait long enough, i never buy any COD games again.  Leason i learn, NEVER PREORDER, ACTIVITION dont CARE, COD adalah SAMPAH"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought it on sale for just under $20. Played single player campaign only. Will not play Multiplayer since it's been several years since any call of duty game had a decent (think map moddable) MP.Might be convinced to play co-op , but not likely.  Nothing stands out in the campaign gameplaywise. Graphics are ok, but nothing earthshattering or revolutionary. I found the 'next gen engine' to be nothing special. The guns seemed mostly the same, none of them really stood out.  The story was probably the weakest yet in the COD series.  My impression : Meh.  Even $20 was too much for the boring, predictable single player campaign. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is just the old game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks....watch it fly
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well I really like this game but the one problem is that, It crashes constentley when I first played it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well at least It is better than bo3...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I kind of do recommend this game where as at the same time I do not...The game is ultra buggy and the single player randomly stops working after a while!! This game is an insult to FPS games but at the same time I do recommend it if you are a massive fan of COD games :( but fair warning the graphic quality fails to please on most cards that I have seen and thats not just ebcause I am running with a GTX 470
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why did I buy this? I hear the screams of 'We didn't listen!' echoing constantly through my skull. I excede the recommended requirements, yet even when running with everything low/off, this game runs like ****....I am now going to retire into solitude. comtemplating what could have urged me to commit to this at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BUYER BE WARNED! THIS GAME IS A PORT!!! Now to the review.  Graphics/Optimization This is a decent looking game, personally i find Black Ops 2 better looking but thats just my opion. This game is poorly optimized, FPS is locked, FOV is locked and must be modififed, graphics look great but if you have a low end card and have to play the game on LOW.Don't play it. On low settings, its very blurry and looks like a PS2 game. Overall: 5/10  Gameplay Gameplay plays like any COD. Basic fast action shooting. The guns don't seem very balanced. The shot guns are very powerful, while the machine guns can take up to a full clip. They added a new slider feature which is nice, but you can't shoot while sliding making it pointless. Snipers have a new scope, which is ok. but i prefer the old ones better. It now has a new point system where you earn squad points which result in buying guns and attachment. I feel like earning squad points is hard and takes too long. The Maps are now Battlefield TDM Sized which feels too big for 12 people. Alien mode takes over zombies, but it slow and repetative with only one map.  Overall :7/10  In the end, this is a game you can pass on. The new features are not worth it and the new Alien mode is less then steller. Plus it runs terribly, even on 2 Titans."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor port of console game. My rig can run BF4 smoothly but not this one. Stupid story, laughable characters, ugly texture... IW is no longer the developer behind MW2/MW, just a shallow imitator."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THIS IS PIECE IF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is worst Call Of Duty ever! DONT BUY THIS!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably the worst call of duty to date, it's horribly bad optimized, and it doesn't even look or play any good   3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of time and money 3/10. black ops 2 much much better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This CoD is realy Bad  It clearly was a direct Xbox one/PS 4 port the steep reqs and bad Optimization for the PC version are a shame.  The campaign compared to MW 3 or Black Ops 2 was boring.  The Multiplayer feels like a Free to play game this game is a desaster developed by 3 Studios IW Neversoft and Raven while Black Ops 2 is just developed by Treyarch.  I would recommend to avoid this Game the performance is bad too even on High end systems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you really must play a call of duty game just play any of the other ones before this one because Ghosts is terrible and a bad port. I don't even mind most ports that are generally considered bad but this is not only a bad port but also a Bad Game. Stay away.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Enjoyed a hell out of Black Ops 2 MP, some 250+ hours. Game ran like a dream, and Ghost pales in comparison on that front. As of now this feels like a rushed PC port with developer's focus clearly on next-gen console releases. PC have had some patches, but still after weeks of resease they haven't fix stutter issues in MP, FoV (mod available though) flickering graphics with Nvidia cards running SLI, or given PC release the level of polish we have come to expect. Never thought I see this day, but Treyarch has surpassed Infinity Ward.   Score after few weeks of release: 4.5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but rater weight for the next one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably the worst call of duty to date, it's horribly bad optimized, and it doesn't even look or play any good   3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THIS IS PIECE IF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,way too laggy and not the game for a budget pc gamer if your looking for a call of duty go for black ops 2 or MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor port of console game. My rig can run BF4 smoothly but not this one. Stupid story, laughable characters, ugly texture... IW is no longer the developer behind MW2/MW, just a shallow imitator."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of time and money 3/10. black ops 2 much much better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is complete crap. The optimization is depressing. I get 90s with drops on lowest settings on a Nvidia 690, i7-3930k, and 32gb of ram on Windows 8. It's depressing and I wouldn't even recommend this game to anyone with the way it is now. There isn't even a fov slider. I feel that IW is just giving us PC gamers the middle finger."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you better stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My Mother said to me- 'Don't smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed and at 20 I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.  69/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not touch with a 10ft barge pole, horrible port, and waste of money, do not buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didnt buy this, my friend did. So im happy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lots of sound distortion and frame drop yet i run battlefield 4 ultra no problem console port â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a call of duty fan, I must say right off the bat that this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The singleplayer is nothing special and bland, the multiplayer is an unoptimized piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Worst cod ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This was over all a great game, great perk system and fast paced shooter. I really love to play multiplayer but, there are way to many glitches such as: i lag out when i join a game, mass lag, it says 500 people in domination but when i join it says 0/0 games found. We all know that this is the key aspect of COD is the multiplayer but, i can not play with all these glitches so i will regretedly say NO. I normally love the COD series but this didnt live up to the potential it had."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought this game on steam, and guess what? LAGG all over the DAMN place! WHAT A BAD BAD BAD BAD GAME THIS IS!  Don't buy this crap serious! You're just wasting your damn money! I tried all the lagg fixes and all the same crap over and over again. At the end of the day it turns out that my system is BOSS and this game really sucks. I don't have 3GB video memory and a 8 core processor to run this game on low and even then i have the most worst lagg ever. The game is TOTALLY unplayable!  The worst part is that after serveral email to activision they send me to steam to refund my money. and guess what? Steam DON'T give your money back!! RIDICULOUS! Turns out you paid your hard worked money on a game that don't works and you get backraped by steam in your back! They just GRAB your money and you have a unplayable game.   Even today this game is STILL in the Steam Store?! WHY PEOPLE? WHY? Just to make money! Don't buy this crap. It's 60 euro waste of money and a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  STEAM please do me a favor and DELETE this game from the market, it's just ridiculous why are you guys selling a game to the masses that sucks bigtime! NO COMMENT! shame on YOU! I NEVER had answers on my email. The only thing i get back is SORRY sir we understand the problem but we can't give you're money back. Look on youtube for CoD: GhostS! Millions of people bought this game on steam and received the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!   I'm waiting steam, give me my money back!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucked the weapons were lame as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ along with the game play. Big waste of money!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get borred very quickly, bots, bots bots bots. Singleplayer was very dull unlike older version of COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is like taking a poop, except I enjoy taking poops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Call of duty not verry good i expect alot more then that really !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,FPS laggs in the game all the time even in the game MENU -.-'  If you dont have at least 8 GB RAM and GTX 760 dont buy it.  (Played with laggs on Med-High settings)  (Normal/Medium settings are looks Bad! High settings=BO2 High settings.)  I've got laggs all the time with:  GPU: GTX 560 TI OC (Gigabyte) CPU: FX-8320 RAM: 8GB RAM (Kingston HyperX) SSD: Kingston HyperX 3K
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible, crossfire support non existant. Hackers, you bet. I have nothing good to say about this game, not a huge CoD fan but I atleast had fun with previous titles. Using peer to peer servers for a franchise that rakes in cash is a slap in the face. Posting this review as I tried playing again on 3/18/14 and had not played since a few weeks after release only to meet the same issues I had day 1. Deleted and will not be re-installing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"An absolute abomination to COD, performance issues, lag, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ campaign and squads mode, still doesn't work 8 monthes after launch. my recommendation is go get a better game that is actually worth the money, COD Ghosts is Toast."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Says I have no hours on record, it's a glitch. Check my profile if you want proof I've played it.  By far the worst COD I have played (I've played every COD since COD4, as well as the original). This does not, however, mean that the game is totally trash.  I will point out the good things first.  Like every COD, this game has fairly solid mechanics. Gunplay feels good. Movement feels smooth, especially with the new movement system. Animations, are, as usual, top of the line (though I did spot a few re used animations).  Unfortunately, that's all the game has going for it. (For MP, at least).  One of the main problems is the lag. IW promised dedicated servers. They did not deliver. If you get a crap host (listen servers), the game will be horrible. And this happens a lot, unfortunately. Many people's connections are not designed for hosting servers. In addition, the game also suffers from sever FPS issues. The game is not well optimized for PC. It dips, stutters, and is generally unstable. Mind you, I am running a very high end rig (GTX680, i5 3570K).  The maps...the maps are OK. They are not like old COD maps. They are big, with lots of flank routes. They are not bad. Unfortunately, the spawn system really lets them down. For maps so big, you'd think they'd have worked out the spawns in 6v6. But no. No. It's horrible. Everyone WILL be spawning behind you.  In addition, IW seem to have gone with the MW2 approach - make everything overpowered. Instead, this time, everything is one or two hit kill. They seem to have tried to make everything as noob friendly as possible.  To conclude, at this state, the Multiplayer is not worth your money.  But how about Single Player and/or Extinction mode you ask? Single Player is alright. Story is solid, nothing special, but OK. Extinction mode is also OK. Not great. Certainly doesn't make up for the Multiplayer.  Wait for some significant patching and discounts before buying. Black Ops 2 is vastly superior."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wouldn't play this game unless you have a long fuse before you explode in rage, and if you have $250+ graphics card!!!  this game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ otherwise!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Boring single player, They somehow made the multiplayer worse and its so poorly optimised for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably the worst call of duty to date, it's horribly bad optimized, and it doesn't even look or play any good   3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of time and money 3/10. black ops 2 much much better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this 'game' is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, nuff said"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It sucks so much
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If they patched the performance issues and weird black lines appreaing everywhere this could possibly be a good game. BUT the issues remain and jeesus christ the multiplayer is boring. This is modern warfare 3...Quite litterally...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is really bad, in single player i got a lot of FPS drop and the multiplayer sucks, its unbalanced, in standard mode, i was lvl 4 and i played with people in lvl 60.  *EDIT* GTX 980Ti: 5400+MB of VRAm usage, maxed out, TXAA, 1080p(ARE U F*CK!NG KIDDING ME?) FPS in Multiplayer is capped at 90FPS(FUUUUUUUUUUU*CK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU) The campaing is cool tho"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,4/10  Cons: -Dumb story -Multiplayer maps too big for the ridiculously small number of players per map. -Squads is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pointless and a waste -Extintion mode is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad  Overall: Nobody plays this anymore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, It's nowhere improvment of thier mistakes in the past, Since Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ itself. This game is downright broken and is barley playable. If you want to win and get high in the ranks like other players, It requires to get a better computer. But why? Infinity Ward just pulled a Black Ops 1 on us. Seriously, Atleast Treyarch learned their lesson and made up for it. compared to this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, seriously. The only thing I enjoy about this game is the GunGame but even then, it's still barley playable I am done with Infinity Ward's games. Oh and making camo out of weed? Might as well make MLP camo or a cigar camo.. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A very broken port of a game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was excited when I pre-ordered this game. Once I finished the campaign, I was dissapointed, plain and simple. It was lacking the depth that was hyped in the months leading up to its release. The multiplayer is aslo bad; constant lagging, numerous game freezes/crashes, and the hit registry is not up to par with the previous titles. What happened to this franchise? Extinction is the only game mode that is fun, except the game freezing/crashing every once in a while. I was a big Call of Duty fan, now...I'm starting to look at the Battlefield franchise. I spent $60 for a dissapointment. If Infinity Ward won't get their heads straight and provide what was promised, they will lose a huge fan base and basically hand their competitors a comfortable share of the gaming community."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game seemed exiting at first, but its extremely hard to control"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I hate this game. its for fagets
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this 'game' is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, nuff said"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bad game worst that i ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,4/10  Cons: -Dumb story -Multiplayer maps too big for the ridiculously small number of players per map. -Squads is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pointless and a waste -Extintion mode is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad  Overall: Nobody plays this anymore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghost is the 2013 installment in the absurldy popular series. But after a lot of hate did they step up with Ghosts ? In Call Of Duty Ghosts you play as Logan. America is caught in a middle of war which is staged by one man named Rourke who was a former Ghost gone rogue. So how is this game ? Overall this is game is not good. Now overall COD has been know for over the top action sequence that make you feel like youre in a movie. But ghosts feels almost like Infinity ward was tired and didnt even bother making it any good. So the game is excatly the same as previous COD games so you know the not much diffrent. Overall there are a few problems that i have with this game in particular. The game is sloppy. The Pc port is garbage, the textures are garbage and dont look anything like next gen and they barely look last gen. The games combat feels slopier while it feels more fast paced. The game adds a slide mechanic which doesnt do all that much just lets you get to cover quicker. The game has a few plusses but nothing too much. The sound quality is great and it has a few fun missions. But lets cover the reason why people play Call of Duty the multiplayer. The multiplayer is probably the worst one yet. The server issues occur often and really just draw you out of the game. boring maps. broken spawn system as always and extinction mode which is Blops zombies with aliens instead. Overall i didnt enjoy Call Of Duty Ghosts at all. I really suggest you stay away from COD in general because this franchise is dead and we all know it. I give Call Of Duty Ghosts a 4,5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I dont have the the ram i need can i please get refunded
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is too buggy :\  the lag comp is amazing and the matchmaking doest help.  BO2 is way better than this and i wish i didnt buy this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD 1 was better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cod get's more worse again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer Pros: -Graphics looks good enough -Squad mode and Extiction Mode Is Good Cons: -Frame Drop -The Maps is too large for Call Of Duty -The Maps is 100% Camper Support -The Ping is too high because the players only 200 - 350 Overall This Game Is Far from Perfect I Wouldn't recommed this game for anyone who love COD In Conclusion Fish A.I Broke The game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There are currently 227 people playing COD: Ghosts on Steam; the servers are all empty and the few that have any players at all seem to be occupied entirely by griefers. Not that I care much about multiplayer, but you'll have to forgive me if I concentrate entirely on COD:Ghost's single-player mode.  Which, of course, is going to consist entirely of moaning because - like all Call of Duty Games - the single-player in Ghosts is terrible. I know, complaining about the sub-par gameplay of the console-era Call of Duty games is like pointing out the brilliance of our nearest star or reminding everybody that water is surprisingly liquid, but I'm still surprised at how bad the single-player portions of these games are. I mean, the developers pour tens of millions of dollars - the bulk of which go into the story mode - into these titles and I've never heard anyone - neither critic nor player - heap anything but scorn upon the single-player mode. The usual excuse is that people buy these games for their multiplayer, but I don't buy that; why spend so much on a game-mode nobody uses? There's obviously a significant segment that enjoys these stories.  I will give the developers credit though; it's nice to play as the villain for once. The protagonists are brain-dead goons with severe daddy-issues working for a tyrannical empire with weapons of mass-destruction ready to be unleashed on the world. In a clever twist, you fight against the heroic rebels who turn those weapons against the evil empire, and - as protagonist - you are forced to use guerrilla and terrorist tactics to fight back against the underdog and.... wait, what? That's /not/ what the story is about? Because it sure felt like it. Despite all the rah-rah gung-ho America-is-awesome patriotic nonsense, it's hard not to feel as if I were the bad guy as I snuck into a city or unsuspecting enemy base and massacred and tortured the unsuspecting populace, especially after being shown that America had an orbital death-platform at the start of the game. And the hero got no points for smart, being - once again - completely unable to open doors without help and being punished if he strayed ever so slightly off the expected path. The game was so tightly scripted as to remove all agency from the player; it's almost as much a 'walking simulator' as 'The Beginner's Game' or 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' (except at least those games allow you to freely wander about at your own pace). I got so tired of it that I ultimately stopped even trying and I still finished the game. I ambled calmly through the hectic firefights when the game expected me to run; I didn't shoot the enemies except when I had to, and when I was forced to pull the trigger I did it haphazardly, never once using the iron sights. That I still got to the end of the game just goes to show how pointless my actual involvement was.  Ghosts also felt oddly gimmicky, even for a Call of Duty game. In one mission, you are controlling a robot dog, in the next you have an remote sniper, then the usual death-from-above segments first popularized - and later overused - by the Modern Warfare games. I got the impression the developers were throwing anything at the wall, hoping one of these modes would 'stick' by catching the interest of the player. None of them did. The game even featured a weird alien-shooting 'horde mode' (not part of the main story line, fortunately) that felt so out-of-field that I was left more befuddled than engaged.  Ghost's doesn't quite match the nadir of the franchise that was 'Black Ops' but it does absolutely nothing to revitalize it either. I remain confused as to why this series has such prominence in the marketplace. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,   Don't waste your money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The series of call of duty goes in the worst direction now,old kind Call of duty at the time of World War II here what exactly pleased.Optimization the worst part of this,on extremely measure i started to play multiplayer mode and after long long loading my game crashed twicely dunno why,maybe its just on my computer as well,but i was reading many opinions about this part and mostly of them was optimization,maybe cause its another console project mostly for xbox one. P.S Anyways,for my opinion,Call of duty at the time of World War II was that sample in a genre of shooter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game was really bad. Don't waste your money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst cod ever.. Never buy this crap. Never buy another iw game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Uninstallation successful. This game is a forgettable mess.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst of the entire franchise! Huge Dissapointment!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst thing ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has innovated in so many ways. Without all of the amazing innovations of this game, such as the advanced fish AI, future Call of Duties such as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare would be bad as this game propelled the franchise further, morphing it into a tactically engaging experience where young children can't survive, giving it the maturest playerbase I've ever seen. They are hardcore players yet aren't super toxic, like in most games, such as Hello Kitty Online. This game single-handedly redefined fps.  loljk"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst steam game I have gotten  I have enjoyed this game on console , so I decided to get it on steam. However, I didn't get to enjoy the game that much as of the servers were not located anywhere in my proximity and I had high ping on most servers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not play this game. I grabbed it via Family Sharing and tried to play it on a PC that can run BF4 on medium-low with no lag. Nope, 20fps. The sprinting is extremely buggy, and it only takes three shots to kill you. Not a fun game, I'll stick to BF4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts, The hate on this game is understandable in the aspect of Multiplayer.    Singleplayer:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game really isnt worth buying at all. Just a recycled version of the other CoD,s. The multiplayer didnt change much, if anything it got crappier. The campaign was ok but still pretty cliche. The only thing I liked about CoD Ghosts was Extinction, cool mode instead of the boring Zombies mode. However you only start with ONE map, ye, only one. The rest you have to buy in DLC's, what a ripoff. Im definitely not buying any other CoD's, im sick of this incomplete sh!t that they call a game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For 5$ the single player campaign is fun to play, well fun to watch anyway........Blown away as I literally can see the money that went into this game burning up before my eyes. 4k/60  A vapid, soulless, waste of talent, time, money and mostly game assets for little more then a game that never lets you enjoy any of its big budget spectacle. Ohh, WOW a cool looking space station (shut up and move forward, shoot 3 people so we can blow it up) Cool the city is falling apart (shutup stupid gamer move forward for more boom-booms) Neat post apocalypse USA (STOP THINKING gamer, move forward, shoot a few pop up enemies because poppa got more boom-booms to show off, daddy loves to watch money burn)   ONLY BUY FOR 5$.....I love Raven software (the devs, they have done alot of fun games) but COD realy is the worst waste of game ever. With the time and talent at Raven this game could and should be the witcher 3 of fps. I realy hope COD becomes deep and wide some day."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,yeah to bad for me. this COD is not the same like COD before.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,When with Activision put a cheat block on their games? Hackers ruin it for everyone.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game!... but it runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't waste your hard earned cash on this, its crashing after every mission, when settings are maxed it crashes, all it does it crash crash crash...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,&gt;Bought CoD: Ghost &lt;Couldn't Play because my laptop was too shity &gt;Sold laptop &lt;Bought new PC that can run anything &gt;Dont really care about this game anymore
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought this game for its amazing fish AI.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst Call of Duty ever been made, it's even worse than Call of Duty 3 which was a console exclusive. Bad pc optimization. Not even a Titan gpu gets average 60fps when maxing the graphical settings.  The game does not use a next gen engine. There are no new weapon sounds and it's very instable. Treyarc is the best developer for Call of Duty when it comes to pc support and optimization."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO not buy at this time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Black Ops II was a refreshing splash of new in a stale and stagnant series. A near-future setting, futuristic weapons, decent maps and a fun and interesting Pick 10 system combined to create a game that I lost over a hundred hours in. Something that absolutely made this experience is that Black Ops II's PC port was handled MARVELOUSLY. Treyarch did an excellent job of porting it, with an FOV slider up to 90 FOV, decent-good textures, and tight controls.  Call of Duty: Ghosts, is objectively inferior in a number of ways. The FOV is hardlocked at 65, menus are insanely slow, people are having trouble running the game at 60 on a GTX TITAN, they've removed Theatre Mode, and, most important of all, the game feels absolutely horrible. In BO2, if you were being shot at, you had a chance to turn around, or outmaneuver your opponent, and shoot back to get a fair fight. In Ghosts, you are downed almost immediately after your opponent starts firing.  Throughout all this, Ghosts still manages to have SOME decent ideas. The gun sounds are just as good as in Black Ops II, the maps are the biggest in the series (for better or worse), and there are some interesting gamemodes that help shake things up.  For the love of Zeus, do not buy this game. I thought that the PC port would be decent-good; but this port is honestly WORSE than Modern Warfare 3's. In fact, when Black Ops II goes on sale for thirty dollars, you go ahead and buy it. Seriously, it's a good game. If you ever do get it, send me a message. I'll play some games with you and try to get the shame of spending sixty dollars on this absolute trash. Don't make the same mistake I did."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,4 hours
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst COD I ve ever played 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,  multiplayer servers are down no one can play multiplayer ..gg
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer- short but full of action, nice cinematics and great story Multiplayer- game on Steam cost 60â‚¬ and I got it for 5â‚¬ but I still regret buying this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game because 5 minutes in multiplayer and I've got headache. There are almost no players in it (if there is any players they are 8y old kids or guys like me who regreting buying it)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WASTE OF MONEY.  There are so many reasons why this game sucks. Cons - It's always laggy. If you have a lower-end PC, loading can take 5-10 MINUTES. The map, 'Free Fall', is always shaking, and it can end up with your death. A boring, bland experience, that is overall lackluster. It's a straight downgrade from Black Ops 2, which is a game I actually like. You can pay for a Deluxe Edition, which doesn't add anything except for a weapom skin, and waste all your money. Pros - Character customization(ish) That's it. Even the character customization is lackluster! I spent more time on the customization than the game. It's that bad.  If you want to have a better experience, buy Black Ops 2, or hell, even just buy Dragon Ball Xenoverse, buy Huniepop for all I care, just do not buy this terrible excuse for a game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'd rather crap in my hands and clap than play this game again.  'Survival' by Eminem is the only good thing in this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, I played 10 minutes of Call of Duty: Ghosts...that is 10 minutes I will never get back.  I could've done something more worthwhile, like stare at a wall. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC Port sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,better than infinite warfare and advanced warfare
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not a my favorite Call of duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Play any other CoD instead of this one. CoD Ghosts is just, really, really bad.  Bad maps. Bad optimisation. Bad everything.  There is not a single thing that this CoD does better than any other one other than sucking the most."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worse game ever!, Dont buy Rubbish"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its Call of Duty. I got this game only because I wanted to play a game like Call of Duty. If you like Call of Duty, this is nothingt new. If you are wanting a good Call of Duty, try any one released after this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy it !  -Poor performance -Hacker -No VAC -laggy menu  -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics   NOT RECOMMENDED
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I found hell. THis is hell. I need help. I'm trapped in a sea of green and black pixels. By the time you find this review I'll already be dead. No. It won't let me die. Run while you still can
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Zzzzz...... (For Multiplayer). Ok the campaign.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well is call of duty...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A pretty solid shooter, but that's about all it has going for it. If you liked the previous CoD games you will get a lot of what you are used to, fast paced missions, gripping cut scenes and an interesting (albeit short) story line.  Multiplayer is pretty similar to previous games (bar the perk system) but still relatively enjoyable, don't expect anything particularly new, its the same old game with new guns/shinier graphics.  If you are running into issues running the game, restore your GPU clock speeds to standard, if it won't start make sure SP and MP are installed to the same folder/drive."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When I first played Call of Duty: Ghosts on release day I was very dissapointed. The online was plagued by frame-rate stuttering and other problems. Since then, however, the game has been updated and most of the framereate issues have been esolved. Unfortunately, the online play is still plagued by lag and other network issues.   Further, the 'innovations' that were promised are either so negligible that they are pointless, or they damage the online play. For example, one of the kill streaks gives you a dog as your companion who rushes players and kills them. Unfortunately, these dogs rule the gameplay for the most part and you will find yourself dying by dogs way too frequently.   While camping has always plagued FPSs, COD: Ghosts brings it to a new level; Where in past games campers were usually easy to detect, the new enviroments in this new installment are seemingly designed with camping in mind. There are bushes, coves, cubbies, windows, holes, and sniper roosts to an absurd level. To make matters worse, Ghosts even goes as far as to offer dedicated campers ghilie suits to better camp out. To compound all of the above, silencers' usual negative consequences have been removed which has caused the prolieration of their use. It is not uncommon to have a match where upwards of 75% of the players are using silenced weapons."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,NOT GOOD M8 DONT BUY M9
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is Dead.  Extinction was fun until i got banned for playing with a widescreen monitor.  Thanks Infinity Ward!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fish AI...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not even playable. Do not buy this for PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty in franchise.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cons: -- Microstutters (rendering the game simply unplayable ;check google for more) -- Horrible FOV  Pro: -- Good voice acting -- Fresh idea with machinegunning in orbit (with no rocoil at all, naturally...)  Final verdict: At this state of the game I simply can't recommend it at all... maybe at a later time."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I was recomending it but i found out that its the buggiest game ever and dlc downloads at least 1 day later then it should so dont get it on pc get it on xbox if you have one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst game of all time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When i first got it, it loaded forever, i was waiting and waiting and then it showed up so i went to multiplayer and 123 people were playing and i was like WHAT?? and i was thinking that they dont like this game on PC and i would agree i went to play multiplayer and it says lost connection and i deleted it and i spended 20.00 on this crap. I thought it was gonna be good on PC but its not.    Anyone in the world wants to get this game DONT BUY THIS GAME BECUASE ITS TRASH! (also cod ghost is better on console)    Only play GOOD COD GAMES! NOT THIS ONE!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is an intresting game.  It has most of what made the old Call of Duty games so great. But it suffers from poor map design, a kill time which is too fast (which encourages camping with those last two combined), killstreaks which are kinda boring, and (the game itself) just not being that fun. Though overall the game (in general) plays decently, I never got too frustrated, but then again it has most of what made CoD good but has so many of it's own problems that it's not as fun to play as CoD 4 or MW2.  And (at least the last time I played it) it suffered from microstutters and texture streaming problems (exclusive to PC) on my GTX 660 (a great 2012 card which can play BF4 maxed out @1080p 60fps).  What breaks the back of this game is that nobody really plays this game that much on PC anymore.  I've payed $40 for the PC version and $14 for the Xbox One version. I don't want to shell out any more money to this game unless it's the Xbox One version (which has thousands of more players daily and I hear the DLC is better than the base game maps). And even then I'd have to have money to kill to even consider that.  I wouldn't recommend this to PC users. If you can find this for (really) cheap for one of the current gen consoles (with the season pass) then perhaps you might get something out of it, but if you're looking at the PC version, just skip it, you won't regret spending your money on something better. If you want to play a new Call of Duty game for PC, get Black Ops 3 instead.  I give this game on PC a 4/10.  And for what the game is (by itself) I give it a 5/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,$60 bucks for a game that no one plays? a game that is old too. the campain is simple and exactly like all the other ones. extinction is fun. multiplayer is fun too. too bad there is only 80 players online at any given moment so finding a lobby takes a while. and good luck finding a lobby in anything other than TDM because no one plays anything else. there's hundreds of players on the xbox 360 and only 80 on PC? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Save yourself the irritation and just pick up Battlefield 4 instead.....unless you enjoy extremely buggy console ports.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game ..   please dont waste your money ..  its an request dont waste your money ..  they made a a game for console and convert files for PC  they lied many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥..   like servers etc  100 of bugs in game and non of them fixing  they not even listing to customers / users  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u infinty ward
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't think if this game is recommended.  I have this game, but there is a FPS drops.  My specs= - Intel Core i7-4750HQ - 12GB RAM - 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor - Windows 8.1 - 1366x768 HD  I don't know why my CoD: Ghosts can't run smoothly. If your specs are better than my specs, maybe you can run it smoothly.  The graphics are cool. The Storyline is good also. But, there is a few people who played Multiplayer. Also, there is a few bugs on maps (Multiplayer).  And the last, sorry if my grammar was bad. :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The only decent thing about it is the story.  If you want to get this game for the multiplayer then you're wasting your money. The spawns are broken. If you want a Call of Duty game with a good multiplayer get Modern Warfare 3 or any of the Black Ops games.

W O R S T G A M E EEEEEVER, STAAAAAY AWAAAAAAY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty game ever. Even the aliens mode (Extinction) is horrible. Although Extintion is the best part of the game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would argue that sometimes there are worse moments in this game than in Duke Nukem Forever... 'blmf' I... I think I just threw up in my mouth a bit.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrendous. If you enjoy games, don't buy this monstrosity."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is pretty cool, and Extinction mode is interesting. Just prepare to play this game only if you okay wih a single player CoD experience."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of duty ghost susks my c*ck? yes it does o tho a game from 2009 bet it  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is getting much badder for every year because the story is not the best and the multiplayer look like crap.  Framedrops i can have like 90 and its going down to 30-40 you really nead much ram and a good grafic-card. And in my opinion the graficÂ´s is badder than every cod game its like they have gone back in the graficÂ´s or its just me so i think the cod 4 grafic is better than ghost!!! :)   So this was my review of the cod ghost!!!!  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been playing CoD since CoD4MW played WaW,MW2 and CoD1. Then i saw Black ops and i was in love with the game,until i played it. It was nothing like MW2 and it was so poorly optimized that playing it felt bad.MW3 was supposed to be a continuation of my favorite series but for me personally it failed to deliver.It was laggy,full of kids and hackers day 1. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up what Treyarch made for BO and the lag was worse than with BO. Black Ops 2. I swear i wasn't going to buy that game. But i am glad i did. Black ops 2 is my favorite CoD of the currently released titles. It was optimised, had perfect single player,had zombies mode and the multiplayer was the best of all CoDs. And now CoD: Ghosts. Ah, Ghosts. I guess it's name says it all. It basically took everty single CoD after CoD4,merged them together and just got rid of all the useful,fun,exciting and revolutionary parts that every other CoD brought, FOR PIT SAKE,was is so hard to put the ingame recorder in this game? And not to mention the fact that not only are we getting this putrid excuse for an optimised game but the sole fact that the multiplayer that Ghosts bring is virtually unplayable is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off. The Single player is the worst till now. I mean come on, it was supposed to be realistic,make you love the characters and put yourself in their position. Well sorry,but if i was shot in the heart with a damn revolver and got a whole train dropped on me under watter after being shot with a missile that can cause an earthquake i would probably be a 50000000 peace puzzle. The Co-Op is okay,but it cannot compensate us for the 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' that this game is. Unless the next CoD is made for the Gamer and not for the Kid i will stop buying games from this title.   So to sum it up for me CoD is dead. Not sure if they're gonna bring it back to life or burry it deeper.   Thanks to all who read this. I'm out..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game sucks takes up a lot of memory, graphics are terrible, storyline is stupid, lags, crashes after starting. also is their a way to get my 60 dollars back"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fish AI...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I found hell. THis is hell. I need help. I'm trapped in a sea of green and black pixels. By the time you find this review I'll already be dead. No. It won't let me die. Run while you still can
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is Dead.  Extinction was fun until i got banned for playing with a widescreen monitor.  Thanks Infinity Ward!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its pretty pathetic, I mean the fact it has so many DirectX failures and errors and requires 6GB RAM just screws every gamer away from even living a 'gamer' anymore, THIS ONE IS PATHETIC IW DO A BETTER JOB NEXT TIME!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hackers playground... Forgot this game or just buy it if you want to loose your money. Official â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cons: -- Microstutters (rendering the game simply unplayable ;check google for more) -- Horrible FOV  Pro: -- Good voice acting -- Fresh idea with machinegunning in orbit (with no rocoil at all, naturally...)  Final verdict: At this state of the game I simply can't recommend it at all... maybe at a later time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a bit of an identity crisis. It wants to be a Modern Warfare game, but it also wants to be something completely different. If you like Modern Warfare, you'll find some enjoyment out of it, but if your not a huge Call of Duty person or wondering if you should jump back in with this game, keep looking elsewhere. The campaign is short and unsatisfying, multiplayer is barely worth playing, and Extinction feels differnt enough from Treyarch's zombies that it's worth playing. Just a decent/mediocre entry in this aging beast. 7/10 overall."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,FAIL So Many Hackers OMFG Now i come back after 2 Months ALL the Hackers are Gone... But What is Funnier.... No one Can Get a Game Due to the Fact they banned all the Hackers = Players  in Short i Wasted $125.00 F-Me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is (in my opinion) a re-make of Modern Warfare 2. The only new feature I find interesting was the sniper scope. I feel this is more of a downgrade from Black Ops 2, the previous title. They attempted to make it more realistic like Battlefield, but I liked the non-realism that was given in Black Ops 2. I do not recommend buying this. In fact, you should just buy Black Ops 2 with the money that you saved towards this game, or wait for the upcoming one made by Treyarch. Infinity Ward also had terrible quality and support for PC players in comparison to the PS3, PS4, Xbox360 and Xbox One. There are a lot less players on the PC version of Ghosts than others."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game Is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Boring End Of Story
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a good game and i like the weapons but the maps suck and the aliends mode is not fun at all also so many micro dlc and this game has no player base so i dont reccomend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it crashes when im in the count down in games ;(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game on PC is a 'Ghost' town 4 real, don't buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the worst game ever released, copy pasted pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mw3 textures, assets and maps. No Q&amp;A testing was done, game looks and run like sh8t, i was luckly and got this game gifted to me, i sure as hell wouldn't pay 5 dollars for this horrbile mess of a game. -100 / 10. PILE OF HORSE SH8T"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What I learned in Call of Duty: Ghosts:  - You invest 50-60 bucks - For an 20-30gb game - Which downloads in steam for 18 hours at 1mb/sec - To play max 4 hours of linear storymode on hardest difficulty.  ...and the only memorable character ingame is Riley - the dog.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ima stick to MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD of all times. Don't waste your time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is full of Russian laggers , spammers, peruvians. Horrible. Just here for the lols"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it was a good game but it is dead try another one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is at most MEDICORE. Medicore story, medicore gameplay, good graphics, poor challenge."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,they said i'd get a free microphone for raging kids dlc where is it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have always been a Call of Duty fan since Call of Duty 1, but after I bought this game I will Never Ever buy any of your games again. Ever since I bought it (release day) until this day, I have not been able to play it. It will not go above 15 FPS, I have a gaming computer capable of running Bf4 among other games at 60 FPS and above, it doesn't matter what setting I choose I have tried EVERYTHING and the game is still not running above 15 FPS, worst game I've ever bought, please never develop games again your company is really really bad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok so in my country the game was 70% off...got the game for like 4,3 euro's with the cd key + dvd's for the game...is the game worth 60 euros ? HELL NO !!! and if you got it for 60 euros then....HAHAHAHAHAHAHA......the game has 2 ways to play it...easy as hell.....or fricking imposible.....dont ghet confused just coz it has more then 2 options in dificulty setings....in 2 hours i think i did 60% of the game....or more...havent finished it yet....but the game is basicly go there shot that...go there shot that..take cover...boring.....the story...is....ummm so and so.....i like the ghots...ideea....to bad that's the only thing good about the game....so overall ghet this game if you can ghet it at around 3-5 euros....pay more then that and you will cry in your sleep !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"many hackers, many cheeaters and very, VERY small maps... save your money don't buy it.. worst cod so far. the maps should be as big as they were in cod 4 or cod black ops, just saying that if the other team is camping allover the map you have pritty much lost thet game. there are 2 or 3 maps that is just big enought for the game be buyable.  Activosion and infinity ward skrewed up on this game..   + grafiks is really good weapon sound signatures is pritty good...  - FPS drops FAR TO SMALL MAPS! The two teams prackticly start ontop of eachother. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was clearly not optimized for PC. The multiplayer does not feel smooth.  It is still playable, but much preferable to play on console.  The single player was decent, but not too great really."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have just buy this game yesterday and every time og go and play just for at litle i get problems like it just puts me out at the game even when i dont play online and i dont now what to do can someone help me ?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"60 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mistake, cod really know how to adv their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games my first experience and it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, battlefield 4 all way"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Games too short, the multiplayer doesn't work......... Glad I only paid Â£13.19 still feels like Iâ€™ve been ripped off though!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game but when i bought dlc i cant use any gun paints from the dlc so not recommended. Plz fix &gt;.&gt;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Never was a fan of this game. Campaign was boring and the multiplayer makes it so you can't see people very well. Colours just don't match.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its fun like always. There is a big NO GO though, and thats sniper players just dont buy this game cause its not wurth it only for sniping. nerved the ADS zooming time way 2 hard. impossible to quickscope descent on pc. the ADS time compared between pc and console = that console Sniper ADS time is 1,8x faster than on pc. enuff videos out there pointing out that infinity ward doesnt even want sniper players anymore on pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So I brought this game awhile back, I'm trying to get the game to launch and I've done all the recommended steps given to me by Steam, Activision Website and Activision Support. This game is not working, and it hasn't work and I doubt it never will for me.  My computer reaches all the recommended tech specs, but for some reason the game won't launch.  I don't really recommend this game to anyone on the grounds that it may not work on their computer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game in its self is pretty good compare it to Black Ops or Black Ops 2 and its a really crappy remake of some classics.  Trying to find a game in mulitplayer is almost impossible, but if you want to play squads or extinction you're in luck. Buy it if its cheap other than that just find something else to occupy your time"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are bored and looking for a first person shooter to play then I will just tell you to not waste your time on this abomination.Oh my gosh...This is one of the worst shooters I've ever played with incredibly stupid storyline and even more incredibly milked engine...Really,Activision?Are you too poor to invest in a new solution? 2/10 won't buy Call of Duty again(unless they will change that damn engine and get back to the WWII)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,absolute junk.......waste of my hard earned money.....I love the COD franchise...and BO2 and MW3 are my favorite...i expected so much more from this new ghosts...what a let down...i uninstalled it and havent been back since
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst FPS ever. Do not buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,make the specs by far but lag on low...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its not even funny
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THE WORST!!!!! piece of sh|t game EVERRRRRR to hit the shelves. Never in my life have I experienced such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pointless , hardware advantaged, pathetic, frustrating!!!!!! beyond belief, generally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ overall, game! They got stuck on the dynamic map idea which I suppose sounds awesome but nothing else have changed for Infinity Ward in terms of map ideas (they still all look the same) the horrible feel or moving around and guns as always, all feel and sound horrible. More than ever does this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IW side of Activision hide behind what you seem to think is 'bad ping or lag' where it is in fact the same old same old, where IW plea stupid, dumb, or no comment. Face it, IW is a total hasbeen department which I suppose only still exist since they have a contract under Activision. (My guess is they would have been fired long ago already if AV had a choice, why put up with this pathetic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i.e.Ghosts in total. It REALLy is that bad! Don't take my word for it. Let the figures speak for themselves...  Buy this game...see if you can find a local game in non peak hours. Less and less people buy COD series on Pc. Even less are playing it after a week. The only way you'll get a game is if your ping runs around 500 and they include like 3 continents, or there wont be enough people online, let alone ANYTHING ELSEEEE than TDM mode.  Cod Ghosts 2014!!!!  still no field of view changer...  still no ping changing...  still hacker heaven.... But wait! there's more...!!! No more steam lookup.... No more game replays. no more movie clips or evidence files (hackers must be ecstatic! It just gets worse and worse. Now if this looks like Raging, oh damn right it is! Don't be stupid too... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! YOU will waste a lot of money!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lol good luck getting any sales you incompetent jews.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD ever!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am adressing  purely the Multiplayer  (Singleplayer in Ghosts is the same 5 hour explosion and shooty shooty boom boom fest as every year, if you would have wondered)  Last year's Black Ops 2 being a bit optimized for PC and a little step up back to the first few COD's, my hopes were high that IW does a bit more for the PC community this year, along with their posts about 'supporting the PC version' in terms of dedicated servers, etc.  Well, this years iteration of COD is a scam again. COD 2 and 4 being the last CODs that I would recommend to play (balanced weapons, gameplay, maps - There are still servers running, especially for COD: MW1!!!), I can clearly say that COD: Ghosts is the worst game of the series.  The weapons are unbalanced as **ck, the killstreak rewards are overpowered crap for the people that already have killstreaks going (as every year since COD:MW2). The maps are weirdly designed and mostly too big for the standard COD setup (6-10 players) in my opinion. Also there are no dedicated servers or a server browser and not even a map selector. So you have to play random maps again.  The framerate is capped at 90 (but has an option for 120 xD), the FOV is capped at 65 and activision has shut down the original download for a FOV changer made from the community.  The optimization for PCs is so poor that I don't even wanna speak about it. But I'll give a few lines:  My mates and I that both have new systems (1 complete new System (Intel - Nvidia) and two upgraded systems (Intel - AMD) with high level CPUs and graphics cards, SSDs and quality RAM (and do not call me a nooby because I would not know If my system is good or not - I think I know pretty well) do struggle with this game at high settings and mostly when zooming in with sniper rifles on this engine (which is - here it comes - the same old modified Quake 2 engine that was used for the first CODs). Also, you need to have  6GB  patched: 4GB of RAM to run the game, although it consumes 2GB RAM at a maximum. The game has 1(!!!) Sound slider for Master sound. On some systems even the menues are lagging if you have the steam overlay enabled. Oh, and there is an 'aimbot' already implemented for you guys. Just plug in a controller and have fun.  I know I forgot many bad facts but I do not want to write so much.  Last I want to say is, that, I guess if the consoles would not be bought by so many ****rds, the PC gaming community would get what they deserve. But as you know, folks, the sale numbers of the 'next generation' consoles is already too high to have any optimistic thoughts about the future. Which means back to Counter Strike and hope for many fixes for the Battlefield series (which is in the same poor condition due to consoles and short development cycles - but at least has decent PC community features) - or for the strategists: Back to Dota and Starcraft 2, which are two of the best games for PC that came out in the last few years."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Have you ever get shoot at the first second spawn?. I am so dissapoint with the Cod series untill Mw3 came out, multiplayers has a turrible spawns, uncreative map designs and etc... So this is might be the last time I'd waste my time and money with this series, I just want to tell you I am so dissapoint."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No ghosts!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD ghosts as all of you guys know is the latest released COD of it's series. Goods: 1- a new story line. 2- stunning graphics. 3- added park our for climbing. 4-epic multiplier with full weapon support with balance damage. 5- no charge to have fun. Bad : 1- badly optimized compared to black ops 2 but that doesn't mean it sucks. 2- many requirements for nothing (6 gig ram) or game will stop ? will i run it at 4 and finished the camping alone so it doesn't need that much ram so please close this message. 3- very short camping with even the highest difficulties took me 5 hours to finish it ... just 5 hours. 4- poor multiplier observation lot of hackers are around at least each in 40 match
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I had such high hopes for Ghosts... why cant they make more games about Mctavish, and Roach... some awesome characters.. This game while fun, seemed empty.. you dont get the story.. nor do you care. This is important in creating these games, building a chemistry with the guys. THERE IS A REASON I STILL PLAY MWF and MWF2.. These may be the best games ever made. Here is a clue, make more games like these. These games make you feel like you are doing something to make a difference, not just some more of the same crap. Ghosts.. tries to get there but the writing and missions suck. Remote control dog option was actually approved by somebody.. GET A CLUE."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I still don't understand how 56% of the reviews are positive.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,'Hey! I'm gonna buy COD:G and see what all the hype about this series is about!'  Never playing another COD game again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is honestly just the worst in every way... DO NOT BUY
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game just sucks. CanÂ´t say anything else than this sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pros;  grey graphics show strong contrast of 2013 and the amazingness of how s-hit and boring it is.  cons'; everyone and everything else.  buy it and thank you steam for letting me review this  i'd also appreciate it if you' d go follow me on the youtubes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To my opinion this is potentially the worst COD release by far. It's not the gameplay, but the technical problems that are killing this game for me. For one, the lag (or is it the lag compensation) is truly unacceptable. You might expect to see some tiny differences between what you experience in game and what you get back from the kill cam, but in Ghosts I often experience quite significant differences. For instance when sneaking up on an enemy from behind, shooting at him as he turns, in the kill cam shot my opponent has already turned completely and was able to shoot me down without showing any shots fired from my side. The second problem are spawn points. Even after the patch I often find myself only a few feet away from an enemy as you spawn. I know Infinity Ward and Treyarch are not sharing the same bed, but maybe they should team up to fix these kind of problems once and for all, because now I feel like they are trying to reinvent solutions to the same problem with each release. For now I'm back to Black Ops 2. This game might not be free of technical problems as well, but it is way better than with Ghosts. Good luck out there and game on!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Iv'e been a fan of COD for a few years now, i like them for there speed, simple gameplay and easy accesability. This game has none of them. It feels slow / jumpy and the maps are so large you spend half the game running around looking for people.  On top of the step backwards in gameplay the game is horrificly optomised for PC, I meet all the Minimum system requirements and i cannot get this game to run right at all, It stutters has framerate jumps and i cant see why, it is an ugly game, the trailers make it seem beutifull but it just is not, the textures are awfull and very low rez.  I would recomend you give this one a miss, it just is not a Call of Duty game At All, which is a shame as i was looking forward to it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many issues to recommend this game to anyone that isn't a hardcore COD fan.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,same game every year......
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Having issues loading the game up, do to an unexpected error. ive waisted money getting this game, im not pleased at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"story was crap, this is so unlike the rest of the COD series, the cliffhanger at the ending was just... excruciating. Left an unsatisfying impression.. imo."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TRASHTRASHTRASHTRASHTRASH AND THIS IS WHY I LOVE BATTLEFIELD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I played through the campaign hearing it was bad. I did not think it could be this bad... the story insults my intelligence and the intelligence of it's target audience. The gun play is bland and the game takes itâ€™s self way to seriously for what it is. The survival mode is merely ok and the multiplayer sucks. 4/20 would not buy again. Donâ€™t ever play it for any reason!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's Cod and there's not much more to say about it tho  dunno if I can recommend this game usuallly yes but there's no one online anymore so no sorry not anymore
Call of Duty: Ghosts,awful its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing call of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing duty wtf if you buy this you are a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Banned without reason. I didn't use 3rd Party program to play cheat in this game, so assumed Activision detected my Logitech G700s which has macros and I only use its function on PvE or Extinction. If it is considered as Modding/Hacking according to  https://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Call-of-Duty-Ghosts-Online-Code-of-Conduct  just because I use that quite durable Mouse, then I have no complaint. I have only played with latest skins from COD:MW just a week + one and only once played with Ark in Chain Saw in Point of Contact Map. *clap* *clap*  Thank for being banned, now I know that if I have mouse with macros, I will get banned by Activision's Game Developer while other developers don't ban me (only temp kick me + ban for afk or FF).           As long as I use the Mouse similar to Logitech G700s, I will not purchase Activision Games (including Spider-man and Transformers) and its co-operation companies' (3arch, Sledgehammer, IW) Games because I don't want to be banned just because that reason again. This game shall be the last game I purchased from them."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts is (in my opinion) a re-make of Modern Warfare 2. The only new feature I find interesting was the sniper scope. I feel this is more of a downgrade from Black Ops 2, the previous title. They attempted to make it more realistic like Battlefield, but I liked the non-realism that was given in Black Ops 2. I do not recommend buying this. In fact, you should just buy Black Ops 2 with the money that you saved towards this game, or wait for the upcoming one made by Treyarch. Infinity Ward also had terrible quality and support for PC players in comparison to the PS3, PS4, Xbox360 and Xbox One. There are a lot less players on the PC version of Ghosts than others."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BEST GAME ON STEAM11!!!1!!!!!1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This Game Is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Boring End Of Story
Call of Duty: Ghosts,FAIL So Many Hackers OMFG Now i come back after 2 Months ALL the Hackers are Gone... But What is Funnier.... No one Can Get a Game Due to the Fact they banned all the Hackers = Players  in Short i Wasted $125.00 F-Me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game on PC is a 'Ghost' town 4 real, don't buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the story mode is good but i wont even start about the multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many cheats and no admin action
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I just wasted 60 dollars for this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you havent bought this dont bother if you have bought this DO NOT EVER BUY ANOTHER CALL OF DUTY GAME OTHERWISE THIS CRAP WILL BECOME ACCEPTABLE BY INFINITYWARDS STANDARS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Even though i got this game and the season pass for free how it was set up for the scorestreaks was really the only thing i did not like about the game. The maps was ok there was a lot of them i did not like i have not played enough to get through all the season pass maps but ill give it a try and i might come back and change my review
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if your lucky to get a game with around 5,000 players only online, your going to face laggers, campers and too many hackers. *goes back on CoD:WaW due to less hackers/players ratio per game*  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor graphics, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor support, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor fps/freezes/dips/crashes, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor community.  this coming from a guy who's played CoD since CoD1.  2/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pros;  grey graphics show strong contrast of 2013 and the amazingness of how s-hit and boring it is.  cons'; everyone and everything else.  buy it and thank you steam for letting me review this  i'd also appreciate it if you' d go follow me on the youtubes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IT FUGGIN SUCKS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is at most MEDICORE. Medicore story, medicore gameplay, good graphics, poor challenge."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it was a good game but it is dead try another one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Biggest sack of trash I've ever bought and I'm begging for steam to refund me seeing how only 1000 people play on the daily. No price above $10 would ever entice me to buy this game ever again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is full of Russian laggers , spammers, peruvians. Horrible. Just here for the lols"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Got this game for free still to expensive...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's not the game itself, Its the developers porting pc like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I like the campaign and extinction but when it comes to multiplayer, its too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hard like jesus christ. They are campers everywhere, weapons are unbalanced, you die way too fast, and is the dog like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing superman?? The dog is so overpowered that sometimes not even a whole clip can kill it. The multiplayer must be either broken or just extremely hard"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My first impresion of the campaing was goodm but with the progress the campaing feels empty and pointless,,,  I like I could unlock all (similar) weapons, attachments and perks that I used in Black OPs 2 bejore rank 10 un multiplayer.  Enctinction mode is so hard solo and it's complete bs..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok so in my country the game was 70% off...got the game for like 4,3 euro's with the cd key + dvd's for the game...is the game worth 60 euros ? HELL NO !!! and if you got it for 60 euros then....HAHAHAHAHAHAHA......the game has 2 ways to play it...easy as hell.....or fricking imposible.....dont ghet confused just coz it has more then 2 options in dificulty setings....in 2 hours i think i did 60% of the game....or more...havent finished it yet....but the game is basicly go there shot that...go there shot that..take cover...boring.....the story...is....ummm so and so.....i like the ghots...ideea....to bad that's the only thing good about the game....so overall ghet this game if you can ghet it at around 3-5 euros....pay more then that and you will cry in your sleep !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,0/10  Needs more campers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game uses to high of specs from a computer so it is TERRIBLE!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I cant belive i paied full price for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nothin to see here move along
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ima stick to MW3
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD of all times. Don't waste your time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,they said i'd get a free microphone for raging kids dlc where is it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good single play mission but bad optimize.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I Recommed Call of duty Ghosts for this kinda players:  If you like campers - play call of duty ghosts If you like to camp - play call of duty ghosts If you love bad textures and a lot of lagg spikes - play call of duty ghosts If you love to have a low fps - play call of duty ghosts  I Recommed It To Play It If You Like This 4 Things!  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it was a good game but it is dead try another one
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is at most MEDICORE. Medicore story, medicore gameplay, good graphics, poor challenge."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"really bad games, no patch, no support. so many bugs, spawns are sucks . i dont advice to buy this game, only if you are codfans =.="
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst CoD yet
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS now wait a few more months when they fix alot of the issues with it. Thats if they are bothered to fix them.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i have almost all cod games!! i like play all very much.. S&amp;D, demolition, headquarters, capture the flag.. ghosts is not cod! is a crap!! for me is over.. buy all cods!! less this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My first impresion of the campaing was goodm but with the progress the campaing feels empty and pointless,,,  I like I could unlock all (similar) weapons, attachments and perks that I used in Black OPs 2 bejore rank 10 un multiplayer.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Please bring back decent physics &amp; graphics together with real life rendering..............  MW3 is still the best COD game ever created with real life feel to guns &amp; acton with the best graphics ever developed in a FPS..............
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am a Call of Duty fan and I especally love the first Black Ops, but this game is really not worth anything. The port has been done horrendous so the graphics look like they're from the early 2000s. The campaign is alright but the characters are unoriginal. You really don't need this game to be honest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's A OK game I would give it a 5/10 game. The Graphics are Ok. The GamePlay is OK. The Story Line is Ok. But the leaning on a corner IS A NIGHTMARE Why can't we just Have the Lean key again? Also The multiplayer is THE WORST! The HUGE maps means CAMPERS There's aredy HACKERS before the game was evan MADE! Also The begening, and the ending of the story IS HORIBAL! 1st. The begining Dosen't make sence! (Not trying to Spoil it!) Also the Ending dosen't make sence How does the guy that you kill Stay alive after Being shot in the Body And Being in the watter for about 10Mins??? Than he drags you away from your brother, and your Brother Dosen't evan care! Neather do you! Also DON'T let me get started on the Credits song! Realy Trayarch That's the best cedit music you could find? Wow... Nice... Also THE SYSTEM REQUIERMENTS! I PRE-ORDERD The game and Guess what I braught it home installed it for about 6Hours and I come to play! ERROR: You don't have enough RAM for the game! Wow 6GB of ram PLUS you have to have a directX 12 VIDEO card?!?!? Why can't you just choose just ONE?!?!? Well I woulden't recomend the game Unless your a COD fanboy And want every COD there is!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,terrible optimization
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Complete rubbish has not advanced on their early games just the same old stuff only needing more RAM space and grephic content
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i absolutely no idea why this franchise is so popular, the story is better unlike the others but the multiplayer sucks just the same"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i have almost all cod games!! i like play all very much.. S&amp;D, demolition, headquarters, capture the flag.. ghosts is not cod! is a crap!! for me is over.. buy all cods!! less this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst CoD yet
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this game what ever you do! Buy annything else! IF you buy it you will regret it. The gameplay is awfull and the graphics int that good. For me it crashes every time i go and change the graphics. Its rly bad. I wish i whouldnt have bought this. I dont understand how thay can release something like this! This is offending what call of duty is. a weak 1/10 stars!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game on PC may be the worse port to PC from console ever made. There are frame drops where I will be getting 60FPS but then will drop to 20-30 for a bit for no reason. I have tried playing this on max settings and there is no point, with a i5-3570K@ 4.2Ghz 8Gb RAM and a OC MSi GTX 770 and i get 40FPS sometimes reaching 60 but on max the frame drops become more regular. There are limited video options and inconsistant settings where on one extra is the max and on another high is. There is no FOV (field of view) slider so a 3rd party program is needed to get more than a 65FOV. The audio options are one slider, no seperate options for Music, game, voices ect. No FPS shower to see fps, Dedicated servers are hit and miss sometimes you are on them but mostly you end up on p2p servers. The game itself looks terrible considering the strain it puts on my hardware, BF4 on ultra 1920x1080 which looks incredible i get 90FPS+ but on this the max settings still have really low resolution and looks terrible as well as the terrible performance. There have been 2 patches that have done nothing really the game still isn't smooth to play, FPS is not consistant and all round isn't a Call of Duty experience. I would recomend waiting for the game to be patched better or just not playing this game at all and go back to BO2 which had a fantastic PC port. Singleplayer 7/10 MP 4/10 do not buy!!!! For now at least."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really had hoped for a good experience for my first COD on PC. After getting so excited for this game and preordering the hardened edition I was definitely let down. Multiplayer is not playable for me because of lag and FPS drops so I can only really play Singleplayer . I have just stuck to playing with offline bots which still slows and stutters like hell at the start of every match.  My Specs are: Gigabyte 7950 OC 24gb of 2133mhz ram (G.skill Ripjaws) Gigabyte X58A-UD3R Motherboard and an i7 960 (Little old now)   I really shouldnt be getting any framedrops at all. ESPECIALLY when it costs so much. By the way the reccomended specs were CHANGED on the release date so those who preordered were screwed over.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Barely a beta version. The game is unfinished, eventhough it is a copy of the previous ones. It somehow manages to look worse than MW3, which didnt look great, yet it uses more ressources..? Laggy, ugly in general (especially the boring colors, not just the horrible textures), it hasn't been optimized for PC whatsoever. A 40gb installation for this game.. what a joke. For me it was a waste of money. Technicaly speaking, Its years behind game like BF4 (or BF3), Crysis... or most recent big budget games for that matter.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is beautifully put together with some great features. Unfortunatly the min system requirements on the box are wrong. The game constantly crashes on my system which is well above the requirements and Activision said I should go buy a new $400 graphics card. Very sad for this game to come out before it was working properly. I could understand a few small bugs, but this is a joke. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not very good , was looking fowards to it but in the end disapointed me. The campain is alright however the multiplayer is very dull and boring, i personally think that black ops 2 of mw3 was a lot better. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can be a decent game once the powers that be finally sort out the hackers/optimization/graphics/lag hen only then would i recommend the game.  6/10 at present but if fixed a solid 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is absolute trash if you want a good fps go and buy onr of the Battlefield games and dont waste your money on this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Lots of hackers and worse than other CoD's. Worst game ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Speaking as a long time fan who actually went down to Game to buy the very first cod when it released many moons ago and has played all of them since. This game is Awful!! It is so bad that it SHOULD have ended the series, or at least forced some serious changes. As you can see, I only have 0.5hrs on the single player, this is because it simply doesn't work! I got about 10 mins of rubbish gameplay and then the game just refuses to run any more. I've tried several times over the last year or so to get it running with no luck. The multi player is just as rubbish, I've played about an hour in total and it was laggy rubbish even on my decent system, the gameplay has nothing to offer. This game is a travesty and I'm annoyed to this day that I actually spent money on it! Get yourself either Black ops 2, which is surprisingly decent on the PC, Titanfall which is what cod seems to strive to be these days or Battlefield 4 which has been improved so much since its release and is a wonderful game these days. Just avoid these absolute pile of poo."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME IS CRASHES AFTER EVERY MATCH I PLAY I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PLAY MORE THAN 30 MINUTES THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. IT ALSO CRASHED 15 TIMES AND STILL DIDNT LET ME PLAY IT AT ALL
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks DO NOT BUY get Battlefield 4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There's so much wrong with this game, I could never write it all down. But in a nutshell, it sucks. Don't waste your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,baddest cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too much camp
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Probably the most boring and generic game in a boring and generic franchise.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i buy the game and then its says that i get banned becose i use cheats and i have to play a lot to get 300 coint and the guns i had
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player was smooth and short enough, so i recommented that. Still, this game is all about multiplaying and that sucks big time! Cheatters, Lags, B***S**T app,s and i just cant find any brilliant from this game.. Just another map pack for MW2, seriosly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"From an old COD fan (every release ever made) this is two steps back in the COD franchise. Bought this, played the campaign and went back to MW3. Occasionally play multiplayer but only when I am bored. FPS is bad, graphics are sad and constant lag makes me mad.  Classic example when you take a powerhouse of talent and break it up through corporate greed. Activision should have left IW the hell alone. Another franchise that will end up in Humble Bundle thanks to Activision."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is great fun.  There is one big disadvantage about it. Even though Activision states: 'All infractions undergo a thorough review process by the Infinity Ward Online Services team before enforcement' ,they seem to ban peole randomly. I have been BANNED from playing Call of Duty Ghost FOR NO REASON today. I am very disappointed about that. I spent a lot of time and money in playing the game. It is difficult to trust in Activison when such things happen. I couldn't find a number to call and complain about what has happend. If one wants to send a message to Activisions support one has to register first. I think that is an imposition. Players can get banned for no reason without any comment but a forwarding to a hompage about rules. Accusation and punishment of persons without giving them the chance to know what they did or to defend themselves against unjustified actions was wrong in the past, is wrong today, and will always be wrong in the future. I lost my trust into that company and am bitterly disappointed to learn that you can get banned from playing randomly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"NOBODY PLAYS THIS GAME ON PC! There are a lot of things wrong with this game. Theyâ€™ve used the same graphics engine as MW3 and some strange new engine for movement that is heard to get used to. There are some elements in this game thatâ€™s completely new to COD, like having fire mode perks for almost all guns. However in saying this theyâ€™ve also taken a lot of elements out, simple elements that make CODâ€¦ COD! Like care packages, theyâ€™ve been completely removed and replaced by â€œfield ordersâ€ that only one player in the game can have at a time and the order it almost always really hard to do. The maps are painful and the server response time is real. But the biggest thing is that no one plays it! â€œ0 Potential games foundâ€¦â€ and on every game mode. If only they did a good job on this game in its early stages. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While this game can be really fun, I cannot recommend it because of the horrible PC port. I have a i5 4670K and a GTX 760 and I can run Crysis 3 on high settings with 60 fps. This game I get 40 on 'high'. But high looks horrible. The PC version of this game runs worse and looks worse than the ps3 and 360 versions. Not to mention the horrible mouse acceleration which can't be disabled, the low FOV (going to a grand total of 80 lol) and the stutter. I have a G-sync monitor and it still stutters like crazy. And finally, when i do get something like 80 FPS, the game will somehow make it feel like 30. So, no, I do not recommend this CoD, wait for Bo3 to be better optimised and get that instead. Or if you insist on getting Ghosts, get it on a console, not pc. Nobody plays Ghosts on pc anymore."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly, I regret buying this and the AW COD. I was totally in love with the BO2 multiplayer and a pretty okay campaing . this game annoying graphics, no real new or improvements and the overall experiance was pretty boring overall."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts was going to be a very good game but when the game came out all the hopes were let down. This game is OVERRATED to the point were a lot of pepole buy it but doesnt play it a lot of time. Actvision made a terrible mistake by dont leting the next COD to be by Tryach. let start with the everyone favorite: MULTIPLAYER. the multiplayer on PC is sucks. lot of bags and lags.and the gameplay is not good like the other COD like black ops. the aliens are nice but not good like zombies. THE only thing that good in this game is the SINGLEPLAYER. even through is copy from MW2 and MW3 single. my rating:6/10 (just buy battlefield 4)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to manny problems with my grafikcard Nvida GeForce GTX 760 SC it just dont run smooth! Hacker still mess up the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is a bag of wank got over 60 hours clocked and it still is a laggy mess, and it aint my system oh no, runninga i7 with a gt 770 with 16gig or RAM....still cant play in max settings...GG..............."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,way too many hackers and steam does NOTHING about them!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible Online Experience. If you can get into a match with 0 hacks the game is decent, no where near my top favorite 5 FPS ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it keeps coming up and saying directx encounted a unrecoverable error check the read me file for possible solutions i did it dident say nothing get it on the xbox or ps3 or xbox one ps4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,graphics looks very bad compared to black ops 1. with gtx660 and i5 cpu is playable with medium settings.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is absolute worst game. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT PURCHASE. It is 100% unplayable. It would be a good game if not for hackers. Every single game has somebody hacking, using aimbots, wallhacks, etc. It is impossible to find a game lobby free of hacks. Valve or IW does nothing about them. There aren't enough lobbies to play the game to begin with. The game modes are mostly empty and that is because of the hackers involved. AGAIN DO NOT BUY!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD:Ghosts - Epic fail.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok so in a way,alot of people think the CoD franchise is golden and there will be no bad games in the franchise,but this game came out and punished me and my computer,the frame rate almost gave my poor computer the 'blue screen of death' treatment,the multiplayer is...ok i guess but the campaign,honestly the best part of it is extinction mode    4 / 10    would hate again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is another COD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I miss world at war becsaue it was not full of the same garbage one big evil chacter the journy of fighting him winning same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again and again but the online was 100% garbage there are barly any weapons do not buy this please save your cash wait for a steam sale or pirate the god damn thing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Whatever you do, dont buy this game for $60. It is just not worth it, the only price you should buy it for is anything lower than 35. The campaign wasn't very interesting or suspenceful like I felt in CoD 4. The multiplayer was okay but the high lvl characters killed any of the lower levels, so if there was a person on there that was max lvl you would pretty much lose. Extinction wasn't very creative in my opinion, don't get me wrong it was nice to have a switch up where they didn't do zombies. Squads was the only thing that stood out to me, very nice setup where you have to work as a team with either your friends or your bots."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Tons of issues, graphic problems and memory leaks. Played to the end after upgrading my machine ram and GPU... Terrible game play, lame story, mostly cut scenes with button mashing. Sometimes a death is unavoidable in the game, just due to bad placement or the game bugs out. Audio issues with constant cutouts during 'cut scenes' other wise known as 'Loading screens.'  Not worth the money. Go pirate it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player was smooth and short enough, so i recommented that. Still, this game is all about multiplaying and that sucks big time! Cheatters, Lags, B***S**T app,s and i just cant find any brilliant from this game.. Just another map pack for MW2, seriosly."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TERRIBLE GAME POORLY OPTIMISED COD has fallen from grace.... the aliens mode is pathetic....  do yourself a favor, do not buy this junk!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not sure if a good game, can barely get it too run!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So i go to play and it says that i can't play this game it says direct x error
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's bad. Bad gameplay, bad mechanics, don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT LIKE IT! :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CALL OF DUTY GAME AS LONG AS THERE ARE CRYBABIES THAT WANT TO REPORT CHEATING WHEN I HAVE NEVER CHEATED.... WHATS THE PURPOSE OF PLAYING AN ONLINE GAME WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU ARE BANNED FOR NO REASON. I HARDLY EVEN PLAY THE GAMES I HAVE. I AM AN AVID SOFTWARE COLLECTOR.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.This game is so bad! I am not sure why I bought this game. I am mad at myself for buying it because there are many better games than this. Even the game Rock of Ages is better and that game is stupid. The singleplayer was ok. I would rate it a 1/10. I would rate multiplayer -100000000000000000/10. The spawning problem from the previous 3 or 4 Cods is back and worse than ever. You spawn might spawn in the room next to an enemy player. The new mode is similar to zombies in that you have to survive but you have to protect some stupid drill to drill through some crap. I am amazed that they could publish this. I could make a better game in 10 min while trying to sleep. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if i could turn back time i would never buy this game. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!

It is difficult to trust in Activison when such things happen. I couldn't find a number to call and complain about what has happend. If one wants to send a message to Activisions support one has to register first. I think that is an imposition. Players can get banned for no reason without any comment but a forwarding to a hompage about rules. Accusation and punishment of persons without giving them the chance to know what they did or to defend themselves against unjustified actions was wrong in the past, is wrong today, and will always be wrong in the future. I lost my trust into that company and am bitterly disappointed to learn that you can get banned from playing randomly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Tons of issues, graphic problems and memory leaks. Played to the end after upgrading my machine ram and GPU... Terrible game play, lame story, mostly cut scenes with button mashing. Sometimes a death is unavoidable in the game, just due to bad placement or the game bugs out. Audio issues with constant cutouts during 'cut scenes' other wise known as 'Loading screens.'  Not worth the money. Go pirate it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player was smooth and short enough, so i recommented that. Still, this game is all about multiplaying and that sucks big time! Cheatters, Lags, B***S**T app,s and i just cant find any brilliant from this game.. Just another map pack for MW2, seriosly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"From an old COD fan (every release ever made) this is two steps back in the COD franchise. Bought this, played the campaign and went back to MW3. Occasionally play multiplayer but only when I am bored. FPS is bad, graphics are sad and constant lag makes me mad.  Classic example when you take a powerhouse of talent and break it up through corporate greed. Activision should have left IW the hell alone. Another franchise that will end up in Humble Bundle thanks to Activision."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was stupid for buying this, it costed to much when it was on sale and it costs too much now. The campaign wasnt very fun or long either. Almost no game is worth $60 dollars DLCs included(but the snoop dogg one sounds kinda good)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,megan fox shooting a drone with a pistol and it explodes?! 11/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the single player is very good with the best cod story ever but extintion is lack something and the multiplayer is just plane boring
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ came out from Infinity Ward's â™¥â™¥â™¥, and killed so many COD fans. IW's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is so deadly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Way to much lag, Even on my specs:   CPU: AMD FX 8350 GPU: R9 MSI 280x  RAM: 8 GB DDR3 (2200 Mhz) OS: Windows 8.1 Pro  This game runs on par with the Wii U version :/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not a great game by Infinity Ward as it was hyped to be
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"was convinced by friends that this would be new and different, but it turned out to be a flaming pile of garbage typical of what the call of duty franchise has become, since their last decent game (modern warfare)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So I purchased this game to see if 'Call of Duty' is actually good. Well it isn't and alot of people are going to hate on this post but the game sucked. Every single mission was overly dramatic explosions... space station EXPLOSION, california EXPLOSION, battle ship EXPLOSION etc etc etc. Pretty much the world comes to an end and two brothers stop that and somehow survived. Seriously the game sucks just eat a wheat bagel, you'll be a lot happier.  PROS: none  CONS: Call of Duty Ghosts.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Runs like crap. 65 field of view. No theater mode. A trillion settings in a menu that lags. I got a god dam 8 core overclocked, dual graphics card computer, and i still need to download a hack to get 90 fov allowed, and then, it lags hardcore? KK. The game.... looks bediocre at best when being ran at max graphics? On my system that got 1050W supplied of pure, clean power, being ran with 16GB of crystalsharp RAM, limited by NOthing, and still, the entire â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing PC freeze when a map is being loaded off of my 264MB/s SSD that was bought 5 months ago after release date? Counter Strike: Global Offensive is EXPLODING. I have spent a couple of THOUSANDS of Krowns on that game. All which can be redeemed later. i have obtained a rank one supposedly need to spend YEARS to achieve. You know what? The 'new' Infinity Ward is trash compared to the previous team. This company has gotten their last chance. Up next comes SledgeHammer. Their standing is at least better. At least their game RAN on computers. At least the game HAD theater mode. At least they actually did their job making a PC version of the game. So unless Call of Duty take after Counter Strike Global Offensive, there will be absolutely NOTHING i am looking for in call of duty. This game as a product has absolutely repelled me to the highest of degrees, and i have now been absorbed up by a game that run at 300 frames per second in whatever field of view to be desired. A game that allow tick rates of either the instant 64, or the perfectly smooth 128 tick. A game that let me forcefully que for a lobby WITH LITTE TO NO lag. A game that actually require a LOT of skill into every single life you are served, and allow you to go from looking like a player without hands to a player that literary can take on ALL the enemies, and come out victorious countless times.  I hope whatever rat that is a 'community manager' actually get a hold of this somehow, someday. Cause no other game has drained out nearly 2000 hours of me in less than 10 months, but CS:GO. And i came from COD, being an annual, comitted PC player. Get a community manager TEAM, fu*k sake."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible game sniping sucks graphics suck infinity ward really took a big fat sh*t on call of duty horrible game waste of money to many 10 or 8 year olds hitmarkers WITH A THROWING KNIFE no score streaks horrible DLC WTF infinity ward?!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is absolutely terrible, it takes so much juice off your computer + single players glitched and i can't finish it + E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y camps. total waste of time and money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sadly I bought this, it has got to be one of the blandest war games ever, visually good but not atmoshpere whatsoever, The game has no depth or immersiveness and doesn't engage you at all you feel like a spare part just pickin up the pieces.  God Know how they came up this the Min Specs for this, i can't see anything Special!!!!!!! It shames the 'Call of Duty' name. It's not worth the amount if Diskspace it takes and a ridiculous amount of ram.  Multiplayer is a complete joke if you haven't played it from day 1. I have never seen such an unbalanced MP. Start lvl 1 and you come up against players at 15-12 What a Joke, Dead in seconds.  This games is a case of all Boast but no Balls.  Sticking to Bad Company 2  This has put me off buy BF4  What a Disaster. Save yourself some Doh Thank God i didn't pay for the digital hardened edition  More like a 'release it anyway on PC' tie-in due to PS4 &amp; XBoxOne Launches (Funny That?)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST COD GAME EVER , DO NOT BUY, FULL OF HACKERS"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What more can you ask from a CoD game?  You have campers, silencers, shotgunners, annyoing dogs, thermal scopes that are impossibly amazing. This game is just great.  End me "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i bought this game for extinction only, only to find out that the servers are always down...like all the time, so i decided to do some multiplayer...game crashes every time, played campaign and was done with ghosts"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible single player missions, extreme buttraping of people's wallets (including mine)  The multiplayer is horrible on PC, as people continue to exploit aimbots and other pointless phenomena on their quest to be the best. Do not buy. Man I miss Modern Warfare 2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought it for 10$, still not worth it. The game would be good if you actualy had a chance to play it. The game is amazing but you can't play it. You go play 2 games online and after that it kicks you out and says 'Unable to verify VAC status' that message will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you really bad, you calidate the game's cache, stops these messages from appearing for a while but after 5 games it will appear again. Oh if that isn't enough i have some kinda bug where half of the players hand model is like glass and you can see through it, same with some guns."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"3rd worst COD, the worst is infinate warfare and the 2nd worst is advance warfare. its a bad game.....dont get it, I got it for $6 on â™¥â™¥â™¥ but if ur going to pay over $6 or even over 1 cent dont...this game is trash and no one is online....there are like 7 ppl a time only on team deathmatch, dont buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game ruined Call Of Duty franchise, not to mention you have to buy almost everything... ...disappointed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,seriously Activision.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros - ADDICTIVE - Squad game You are in a squad of six with a mix of friends and AIs vs a similar mix or just all AIs is fun. You can level your AIs and buy them Perks and all kinds of weapon modifications. This becomes very addictive. The AIs are very well done, then even back away from you when they reload or you open fire on them. The AIs do stunts and check around so they don't know you are there till they spot you which makes this game so fun you don't need to play against people.  Cons - sloppy code regarding FPS - huge memory leaks [so you need a lot of RAM to play for awhile] I have updated my drivers, I have turned off textures, blurring, water, and everything is off or on low. Windowed mode (no border) is selected. My driver is up-to-date. Unless you can pay less than 9.99 for the game with all DLCs, you are playing with fire. I have read about people with 2013 [like mine HD 7700 series] and 2014 video cards still having the same issues.  And after 10 games it becomes very laggy in the game. Checking around on the internet everyone is having the same issues. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You know, I think this is actually an okay game, ofcourse it's just your average modern age fps. I've played this a little on the Xbox One, can't really get used to playing fps' on consoles. Well, lets stay on topic, this game...is unplayable on PC...doesnt even work properly for most people, framedrops and freezes are very common. Also, what makes everything worse, this game DOES NOT have a cheat protection. Although I've never encountered hackers, I always hear people moaning about hackers being everywhere..so if you plan on buying this, just dont...Its not worth right now...maybe once all dlcs' are out this game will work properly"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont bother,terrible on pc.lag and bad hit detection"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If i could summarize this game into one word it would be...LAG fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont Buy this game at all guys. I bought it and is really feel wasted my Money. Firstly u will always face FPS Problem, coz of which u will be murdered all times. and most important it is filled with hackers. If u want to play campaign i guess there are better Games than this. So please dont waste ur money for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game on somewhat of a whim, having played and enjoyed MW3 with a friend at his house. This game by comparison is just garbage. I've never wanted a refund so badly. I hadn't even accumulated enough time to leave a review when I first tried, I had to let it sit on the menu while I used the bathroom. And why? Because seemingly everything outside of the single player campaign kicks you to the multiplayer program, which you can't leave a review for.  It looks like butt. It's just not good. I regret the purchase."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks DO NOT BUY get Battlefield 4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crash to desktop simulator 2014
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is absolute trash if you want a good fps go and buy onr of the Battlefield games and dont waste your money on this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Speaking as a long time fan who actually went down to Game to buy the very first cod when it released many moons ago and has played all of them since. This game is Awful!! It is so bad that it SHOULD have ended the series, or at least forced some serious changes. As you can see, I only have 0.5hrs on the single player, this is because it simply doesn't work! I got about 10 mins of rubbish gameplay and then the game just refuses to run any more. I've tried several times over the last year or so to get it running with no luck. The multi player is just as rubbish, I've played about an hour in total and it was laggy rubbish even on my decent system, the gameplay has nothing to offer. This game is a travesty and I'm annoyed to this day that I actually spent money on it! Get yourself either Black ops 2, which is surprisingly decent on the PC, Titanfall which is what cod seems to strive to be these days or Battlefield 4 which has been improved so much since its release and is a wonderful game these days. Just avoid these absolute pile of poo."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can be a decent game once the powers that be finally sort out the hackers/optimization/graphics/lag hen only then would i recommend the game.  6/10 at present but if fixed a solid 8/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i cant play this game even though i bought it. Cod Ghosts= Waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have tried to play this game but it allways freezes my computer when it gets into a certaqin level. I loved the game whne I first got it but it is nothing but trash now. I cant even remove in and reinstoll it to give it another chance. It is the onluy game that has ever done this to me. So on a one to five rating I would have to give it a one or less.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not really into writing this reviews and stuff, but when you try to play something, and you just can't, I feel like writing this.   I'll be talking mostly about the Mutliplayer, 'cause it's the reason why most players buy the game, and single-player, oh well, enougly said with the first mission, being same as last in CoD: MW2...  So, I played game for a quite sometimes, and I just can't forgive it. It's totally different from what other CoD games used to be... (talking about the ones, I'll really likely remember, CoD2...)  Speaking of Multiplayer, I found it really boring, bad, and even disturbing in some case, I'll say all I think about Multiplayer, things I like, and things I don't...  Things I mostly enjoyed about Multiplayer: -Guns, number of guns, their look, attachments... -Perks, and Customizing function are pretty good... -Maps, they aren't bad at all, there are bad ones, but also, there are good ones...  Thing I dislike so much about Multiplayer: -Unbalanced guns, I get killed by same gun I have, but by one hit... -Lags, I got suddenly killed, and in replay screen, I see that guy from other edge of map killed me with knife... -Dogs, I wish I can have dogs like ones in Multiplayer, srsly tho, I can't kill them with 2 bullets of 'sniper rifle'... -Gadgets, the ones like I.M.S. , whole magazine can't kill it, same with satellite (it takes less shots, but still)... -Empty Modes, game has many of game modes, but mostly played ones are Team Deathmatch, and Free For All... -Campers, this should not be a bad thing, CoD always had this players, who makes us all rage... -Unfair kills, usually when I got killed without any explanation, who, and how... -Random spawn, enemy may spawn right behind you, from nowhere, that's why BF is better I guess... -Invisible gadgets, may be bug or something, but I seem to die from I.M.S. that wasn't below me... -No report function while playing, you can report only while in lobby, which is useless... -God like players|OR|Cheaters are everywhere, one shot kill from assault rifle, grenade that somehow caches you no matter where you are... -Strong armors, the one I especially hate, when I spend way so many bullets on enemy, but he don't die...  -Snipers, special skill, that makes player know where you are, and kill you within an bullet... Instantly...  Well, there are really many bad things, In the end, I don't recommand it, especially not for it's price. And one more thing (I TOTALLY WON'T COMMENT) that I said before... Last mission in CoD:MW2 is same as first in CoD:Ghosts, seems like someone has no ideas for their game...  Also, this is WORST game I ever played. So, if you are BIG CoD fan, you should get it, and if you are PRO, otherwise, this is not a game.  In the end, It's all my opinion, I dislike it, and I DON'T recommand it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The same as any other CoD game. Only play it for the storyline campaign. Everything else is rubbish.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do NOT buy this game under ANY conditions!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if u make the same mistake i did buying this game i will hunt you.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad game: lags, bugs, too high system requirements for so low graphics. BF4 is better optimized and need slower computer to play better graphics than this game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is poorly optimized for PC. I'm running a 3rd gen intel i5 processor, nvidia gefore 660 graphics card and 8GB of memory and I can't get decent FPS unless I'm on low-mid settings. The campaign is only 4 hours long and you die faster in multiplayer than you did in Black Ops 2, and I havn't gotten used to it yet. On the upside, the Extinction gamemode is fun and I enjoy it a lot more than zombies."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i expected better from infinityward. the servers in this game are crap and i lag up/get disconnected all the time. and they didn't even put efort into making it. they just took a animation from MW2 and put new mobels and textures into it. also the guns lack detail to, the chain-saw's texture always has extended-mags, and a grenade launcher on it because they were to lazy to make seperate textures/mobels, i have got to say this was a worse decision than buying WarZ. it looks like COD is going down hill.... i hate my self for not listening for all those bad reviews.  just if we could get refunds since i spend $60 on this failure of a game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I regret getting this game more than all other regretted games combined. Sure it may be great on consoles, but on pc it's absolutely horrible. This is the least optimized game i've ever seen. The storyline is pretty good, and the game modes are nice, but it doesn't matter if you can't play it. But I can't complain, after all the fish move away when you swim!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lag, hackers, bugs and no help from the support. If you're gonna get this game, I suggest you get it for console instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"dont like this game. too fast, no atmosphere, storyline is crap like always. i miss the earlyer games. now its just a collection of beautiful effects a and nothing else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i have almost all cod games!! i like play all very much.. S&amp;D, demolition, headquarters, capture the flag.. ghosts is not cod! is a crap!! for me is over.. buy all cods!! less this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS now wait a few more months when they fix alot of the issues with it. Thats if they are bothered to fix them.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is not like the other Call of dutys. Now a days call of duty has gone downhill. With the PC it is the badest Call of duty i have played so far (And i though MW3 was bad) But this is dessonding and now i have gone to Battlefeild, I have played call of duty for a long time and i think it is time for people to move on. Every year call of duty is getting orser orser and orser every year. MW2, COD 4 and COD WAW where the best call of dutys for me. So DON'T GET IT!!! . There is also so many hackers then i have EVER seen. Call Of Duty... Get your game face on your are falling down..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is beautifully put together with some great features. Unfortunatly the min system requirements on the box are wrong. The game constantly crashes on my system which is well above the requirements and Activision said I should go buy a new $400 graphics card. Very sad for this game to come out before it was working properly. I could understand a few small bugs, but this is a joke. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, its not worth it. Wait for it to die down to 30 dollars cause this came is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the PC. Console version is so much better. My best friend has an Xbox One and this game and I saw so much better quality in it than the PC Verision. I have a EVGA Gtx 660 and for the quality I expected from the game that I got, it was terrible...Nothing wrong with the card, just the game sucks...dont buy it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PROS OF THE GAME:   Clan Invite: exstablish a clan and earn points though out the game modes you play as a team.  New game modes: Are a plus.  CONS OF THE GAME:   As for Ghost I was very disappointment in this game. I upgraded my machine to try to get better performance out of the game still all in all it has bad coding. MW3 IMO is a better looking game. As for Valves Anti Cheat Software the hole that was used for MW3 hacks has been implemented in this game as well I'm sure all the hackers from MW3 migrated to Ghost and are not shy about being caught. Why? Good question I suppose nothing is ever done to those who cheat. This is just from what I have seen maybe the cheaters are being removed and they are coming back again and again with new steam accounts I don't know for sure, but I see them the same ones over and over. Unless you want to run a private match and just play with a group of friends who you know don't cheat then you will enjoy the multiplayer part of the game. The game shutters in the lobby and isn't constant some days its fine and others are real bad. Certain video card drivers are know for their display drivers to crash. So my rating for this game is a negative rating. This maybe my last Call of Duty game I'll buy unless I see a change in the fanchise. Dedicated Servers ! Punkbuster Anticheat Software !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to manny problems with my grafikcard Nvida GeForce GTX 760 SC it just dont run smooth! Hacker still mess up the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is a bag of wank got over 60 hours clocked and it still is a laggy mess, and it aint my system oh no, runninga i7 with a gt 770 with 16gig or RAM....still cant play in max settings...GG..............."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts was going to be a very good game but when the game came out all the hopes were let down. This game is OVERRATED to the point were a lot of pepole buy it but doesnt play it a lot of time. Actvision made a terrible mistake by dont leting the next COD to be by Tryach. let start with the everyone favorite: MULTIPLAYER. the multiplayer on PC is sucks. lot of bags and lags.and the gameplay is not good like the other COD like black ops. the aliens are nice but not good like zombies. THE only thing that good in this game is the SINGLEPLAYER. even through is copy from MW2 and MW3 single. my rating:6/10 (just buy battlefield 4)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Only get this game if it's on special or are a die hard cod fan.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is bad, like really bad. The devs need to get their heads out of their own asses and start working on making their games less cluttered and shameful."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst CoD yet
Call of Duty: Ghosts,way too many hackers and steam does NOTHING about them!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible Online Experience. If you can get into a match with 0 hacks the game is decent, no where near my top favorite 5 FPS ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is absolute worst game. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT PURCHASE. It is 100% unplayable. It would be a good game if not for hackers. Every single game has somebody hacking, using aimbots, wallhacks, etc. It is impossible to find a game lobby free of hacks. Valve or IW does nothing about them. There aren't enough lobbies to play the game to begin with. The game modes are mostly empty and that is because of the hackers involved. AGAIN DO NOT BUY!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"dont like this game. too fast, no atmosphere, storyline is crap like always. i miss the earlyer games. now its just a collection of beautiful effects a and nothing else."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,graphics looks very bad compared to black ops 1. with gtx660 and i5 cpu is playable with medium settings.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it keeps coming up and saying directx encounted a unrecoverable error check the read me file for possible solutions i did it dident say nothing get it on the xbox or ps3 or xbox one ps4

Call of Duty: Ghosts,if i could turn back time i would never buy this game. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was stupid for buying this, it costed to much when it was on sale and it costs too much now. The campaign wasnt very fun or long either. Almost no game is worth $60 dollars DLCs included(but the snoop dogg one sounds kinda good)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok so in a way,alot of people think the CoD franchise is golden and there will be no bad games in the franchise,but this game came out and punished me and my computer,the frame rate almost gave my poor computer the 'blue screen of death' treatment,the multiplayer is...ok i guess but the campaign,honestly the best part of it is extinction mode    4 / 10    would hate again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is another COD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I miss world at war becsaue it was not full of the same garbage one big evil chacter the journy of fighting him winning same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again and again but the online was 100% garbage there are barly any weapons do not buy this please save your cash wait for a steam sale or pirate the god damn thing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Whatever you do, dont buy this game for $60. It is just not worth it, the only price you should buy it for is anything lower than 35. The campaign wasn't very interesting or suspenceful like I felt in CoD 4. The multiplayer was okay but the high lvl characters killed any of the lower levels, so if there was a person on there that was max lvl you would pretty much lose. Extinction wasn't very creative in my opinion, don't get me wrong it was nice to have a switch up where they didn't do zombies. Squads was the only thing that stood out to me, very nice setup where you have to work as a team with either your friends or your bots."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Tons of issues, graphic problems and memory leaks. Played to the end after upgrading my machine ram and GPU... Terrible game play, lame story, mostly cut scenes with button mashing. Sometimes a death is unavoidable in the game, just due to bad placement or the game bugs out. Audio issues with constant cutouts during 'cut scenes' other wise known as 'Loading screens.'  Not worth the money. Go pirate it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD:Ghosts - Epic fail.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Battlefield 4 &gt; CoD:Ghosts As long as I was a fan of CoD it ends with Ghosts.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not really into writing this reviews and stuff, but when you try to play something, and you just can't, I feel like writing this.   I'll be talking mostly about the Mutliplayer, 'cause it's the reason why most players buy the game, and single-player, oh well, enougly said with the first mission, being same as last in CoD: MW2...  So, I played game for a quite sometimes, and I just can't forgive it. It's totally different from what other CoD games used to be... (talking about the ones, I'll really likely remember, CoD2...)  Speaking of Multiplayer, I found it really boring, bad, and even disturbing in some case, I'll say all I think about Multiplayer, things I like, and things I don't...  Things I mostly enjoyed about Multiplayer: -Guns, number of guns, their look, attachments... -Perks, and Customizing function are pretty good... -Maps, they aren't bad at all, there are bad ones, but also, there are good ones...  Thing I dislike so much about Multiplayer: -Unbalanced guns, I get killed by same gun I have, but by one hit... -Lags, I got suddenly killed, and in replay screen, I see that guy from other edge of map killed me with knife... -Dogs, I wish I can have dogs like ones in Multiplayer, srsly tho, I can't kill them with 2 bullets of 'sniper rifle'... -Gadgets, the ones like I.M.S. , whole magazine can't kill it, same with satellite (it takes less shots, but still)... -Empty Modes, game has many of game modes, but mostly played ones are Team Deathmatch, and Free For All... -Campers, this should not be a bad thing, CoD always had this players, who makes us all rage... -Unfair kills, usually when I got killed without any explanation, who, and how... -Random spawn, enemy may spawn right behind you, from nowhere, that's why BF is better I guess... -Invisible gadgets, may be bug or something, but I seem to die from I.M.S. that wasn't below me... -No report function while playing, you can report only while in lobby, which is useless... -God like players|OR|Cheaters are everywhere, one shot kill from assault rifle, grenade that somehow caches you no matter where you are... -Strong armors, the one I especially hate, when I spend way so many bullets on enemy, but he don't die...  -Snipers, special skill, that makes player know where you are, and kill you within an bullet... Instantly...  Well, there are really many bad things, In the end, I don't recommand it, especially not for it's price. And one more thing (I TOTALLY WON'T COMMENT) that I said before... Last mission in CoD:MW2 is same as first in CoD:Ghosts, seems like someone has no ideas for their game...  Also, this is WORST game I ever played. So, if you are BIG CoD fan, you should get it, and if you are PRO, otherwise, this is not a game.  In the end, It's all my opinion, I dislike it, and I DON'T recommand it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,idk what the hell i was thinking playing this crap for almost 80 hours.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is so bad, that it uninstalled itself. True story btw"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have tried to play this game but it allways freezes my computer when it gets into a certaqin level. I loved the game whne I first got it but it is nothing but trash now. I cant even remove in and reinstoll it to give it another chance. It is the onluy game that has ever done this to me. So on a one to five rating I would have to give it a one or less.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,!!!WARNING!!!DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!WARNING!!!  ITS JUST A SCAM ! I never could tell that activision(small letter by meaning) can scam someone but yes. They banned i think like 1/3 of the cod ghost players and tell that U had cheated! 0/11  NEVER BUY IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a total disaster. Nuff' said. It was OK to begin with, but it's just a total disaster."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just another CoD game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Trash MP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really only good for people who want a rehash of the last several games. Pretty meh.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bad ending in campaign :( evil must stop NOT win
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible, terrible game.  I guess I shouldn't have played this right after playing FC4 and FC Primal - those games make COD Ghosts seem like an on-the-rails children's game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Charlie The Cat Could Make A Better Game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,every time when i join a game i lag like crazy also my friend does.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,terrible pc port. big waste of money. dont get it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is the standard Action Movie fare as seen in previous Modern Warfare titles. The Multiplayer is pretty much dead on PC and somehow worse than previous games. Supposedly dedicated servers but it doesn't seem like it. Not worth full price
Call of Duty: Ghosts,idk what the hell i was thinking playing this crap for almost 80 hours.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is so bad, that it uninstalled itself. True story btw"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing boring pice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you buy this game, the terrorists win."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst game on my steam acount.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,!!!WARNING!!!DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!WARNING!!!  ITS JUST A SCAM ! I never could tell that activision(small letter by meaning) can scam someone but yes. They banned i think like 1/3 of the cod ghost players and tell that U had cheated! 0/11  NEVER BUY IT
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The screen tearing is real. The game is poorly optimized. the graphics are terrible in everything except the characters and the weapons, the grass is literally just blotches of different shades of green. Not only that it only takes 1 minute to get vac banned for aparently no reason when you email and ask the company."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the single player is very good with the best cod story ever but extintion is lack something and the multiplayer is just plane boring
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horible game dont buyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy plz this game is siagrace to gaming.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not sure if a good game, can barely get it too run!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So i go to play and it says that i can't play this game it says direct x error
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's bad. Bad gameplay, bad mechanics, don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the ugliest game ever full of litlle child who want to suck my biggest coock ! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So I purchased this game to see if 'Call of Duty' is actually good. Well it isn't and alot of people are going to hate on this post but the game sucked. Every single mission was overly dramatic explosions... space station EXPLOSION, california EXPLOSION, battle ship EXPLOSION etc etc etc. Pretty much the world comes to an end and two brothers stop that and somehow survived. Seriously the game sucks just eat a wheat bagel, you'll be a lot happier.  PROS: none  CONS: Call of Duty Ghosts.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CALL OF DUTY GAME AS LONG AS THERE ARE CRYBABIES THAT WANT TO REPORT CHEATING WHEN I HAVE NEVER CHEATED.... WHATS THE PURPOSE OF PLAYING AN ONLINE GAME WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU ARE BANNED FOR NO REASON. I HARDLY EVEN PLAY THE GAMES I HAVE. I AM AN AVID SOFTWARE COLLECTOR.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is the 10th installment to the franchise on what Infinity Ward and Activision claim is a refreshing and new experience it just doesn't make the cut. The campaign is good but short, and the new extinction mode gives a new twist of a fun game mode with aliens. But the multiplayer just doesn't cut it as the dynamic map elements aren't that dynamic. Since when is shooting a log and it falling down so you can cross on it really dynamic? Not really. As for performance the game overall on PC is a wreck in it's current state of this review. From stuttering to lag issues when looking across the map even for users who have a high end PC and have the latest graphics card drivers installed, and although this may be fixed in the future it sure is taking Infinity Ward a long time to deal with this problem. Security is terrible I have already ran into numerous hackers with aimbot, wallhacks, and etc. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product in it's current state."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As I say for all cod games, More shooty shooty bang bang, but in a new look"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is too late to even regret
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What was I thinking when I bought this game?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Jan 13 2016. This just happened to me. I have not played COD Ghosts in over a year.  I only have 59 hours into the game. I stopped playing it over a year ago and came back  tonight because a friend has it and we decided to play it. I load the game and jump  into a server and in roughly 2 min i'm booted. Screen comes up and says I have been banned.  Now like I said I have not played it in a year then I play for 2 min and banned.  I am 41 years old and not a child. I have been playing games since the commodore 64.  I have 12 consoles and 4 gaming computers in my home. I have NEVER cheated in a game.  I did not even like the game genie for the 8-bit nes. I know nothing about how to hack  or crack a game to cheat. If the cheat was given to me I would not know how to use it.  I HATE cheaters and deal with them on a daily basis and I get banned. like I said I am  not a child and I know theft when it happens. I will not stand by or let this go. If I do  then they get away with theft. I know for a fact that I have not broken any rules in their  guidelines regarding bans. What they are doing is stealing my game from me and I will not  stop until I have answers. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i cant play this game even though i bought it. Cod Ghosts= Waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a total disaster. Nuff' said. It was OK to begin with, but it's just a total disaster."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TERRIBLE GAME POORLY OPTIMISED COD has fallen from grace.... the aliens mode is pathetic....  do yourself a favor, do not buy this junk!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worse game i have ever bought.. i wisg i could have gotten a refund bacl there.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"itÂ´s not the bet game, but you can play it, okey only the single player"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,One of the worst CoD I've played. Good thing I bought the retail box for â‚¬4.  The single player is cringeworthy and the multiplayer is your run of the mill genric CoD recycled bs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As I say for all cod games, More shooty shooty bang bang, but in a new look"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is too late to even regret
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What was I thinking when I bought this game?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is seriously laggy.... When the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are we going to get the Dedicated servers back so we can admin our own servers so we can get rid of all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hackers that VAC wont ban

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its need too spec PC
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Had high expectations for this game (multiplayer) after Bo2, extremely dissapointed. Unbalanced, lots of bullsh*t, so on and so forth. For anyone wanting a good multiplayer game i either reccomend CS:GO or BF4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer was OK, multiplayer sucks, performance is all around horrid. The $60 pricetag is a bigger kick in the balls than every EA and Crapcom game combined."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Stupid campaign -It was a camPAIN for me- and terrible multiplayer. Play Battlefield
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks big time i rather play facebookgames
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible optimisation for the PC this is 2014 the game was released in 2013 sort it out!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why did i buy the season pass if i still need to purchase every downloadable content?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,RUN AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS STILL FREEZIN FEB 7 2014 DONT BELIVE BE ASK YOUR FRIENDS OR BUY THE GAME AND BE DISAPOINTED AND DISCUSSED LIKE I AM NOW BOTH GHOSTS CAMPAIGN MODE AND MULTIPLAYER RIN OK FOR 10 SECONDS THEN THE FPS DROPS TO 7 THEN BACK UP TO 120 CONSTANTLY I HAVE 2 GTX 680'S IN SLI i7 3820 OVERCLOCKED STABLE AT 4.7 GHZ   IVE BEEN LOOKIN FOR PATCH TO SEE IF IVE MISSED ANYTHING BUT WAS TOLD THE GAME UPDATES ITSELF AUTOMATICLY THROUGH STEAM.  INFRNTRY WARD GET YO SH*&amp; TOGETHER MAN JESUS CHRIST NEXT GEN MY FU*&amp;^* â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game! I can't believe that Infinity Ward released this game. It's the most unoptimized game on Steam. Every other Call of Duty game can be easily played on max settings with excellent frame rates, at least for my $100 graphics card (GTX 650 Ti). However, this game... I can barely run at playable frame-rates on the lowest graphics settings. This is ridiculous! Zooming into a sniper scope cuts your FPS in half, even if you're running on the best graphics card in the world. The texture qualities are pixellated, the model detail on most objects are low, and the overall graphics fidelity is just atrocious. Don't even get me started on the 35 GB download... I mean, are you serious Infinity Ward? 35 Gigabytes of space for the worst looking game of 2014?! Really?! I'm never buying another Infinity Ward Call of Duty title again. This is Modern Warfare: 2 all over again! Do not buy this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horible on steam. The gameplay is very laggy and multiplayer never runs smoothly. There are also not enough players so you will sometimes have trouble finding matches. Great game but obviously for consoles only.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Played for an hour. This game is boring!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game ruined Call Of Duty franchise, not to mention you have to buy almost everything... ...disappointed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,seriously Activision.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont bother,terrible on pc.lag and bad hit detection"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pros - ADDICTIVE - Squad game You are in a squad of six with a mix of friends and AIs vs a similar mix or just all AIs is fun. You can level your AIs and buy them Perks and all kinds of weapon modifications. This becomes very addictive. The AIs are very well done, then even back away from you when they reload or you open fire on them. The AIs do stunts and check around so they don't know you are there till they spot you which makes this game so fun you don't need to play against people.  Cons - sloppy code regarding FPS - huge memory leaks [so you need a lot of RAM to play for awhile] I have updated my drivers, I have turned off textures, blurring, water, and everything is off or on low. Windowed mode (no border) is selected. My driver is up-to-date. Unless you can pay less than 9.99 for the game with all DLCs, you are playing with fire. I have read about people with 2013 [like mine HD 7700 series] and 2014 video cards still having the same issues.  And after 10 games it becomes very laggy in the game. Checking around on the internet everyone is having the same issues. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You know, I think this is actually an okay game, ofcourse it's just your average modern age fps. I've played this a little on the Xbox One, can't really get used to playing fps' on consoles. Well, lets stay on topic, this game...is unplayable on PC...doesnt even work properly for most people, framedrops and freezes are very common. Also, what makes everything worse, this game DOES NOT have a cheat protection. Although I've never encountered hackers, I always hear people moaning about hackers being everywhere..so if you plan on buying this, just dont...Its not worth right now...maybe once all dlcs' are out this game will work properly"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"10/420 Doritos ,don't even buy it . Poor gameplay,boring maps and it is that same Call Of Duty.Try Battlefield instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont Buy this game at all guys. I bought it and is really feel wasted my Money. Firstly u will always face FPS Problem, coz of which u will be murdered all times. and most important it is filled with hackers. If u want to play campaign i guess there are better Games than this. So please dont waste ur money for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game on somewhat of a whim, having played and enjoyed MW3 with a friend at his house. This game by comparison is just garbage. I've never wanted a refund so badly. I hadn't even accumulated enough time to leave a review when I first tried, I had to let it sit on the menu while I used the bathroom. And why? Because seemingly everything outside of the single player campaign kicks you to the multiplayer program, which you can't leave a review for.  It looks like butt. It's just not good. I regret the purchase."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Whenever i launch the game it shows a black screen. What do i do to fix this? Do i not have the right system requirement? please help!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If i could summarize this game into one word it would be...LAG fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hit badly by hackers and it was dying a month after release. Just get Counter Strike.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Im just here to Vote it down, lol."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not on pc, its a bad port but the game its self is okay not great but okay."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If You Want To Play A Good Cod Made By Infinity Ward Then Go Play Cod 4 Or MW2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'The war never changes', same applies to COD games"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I launch the game, and then I am greeted with so much lag that i cannot play. My PC is actually quite good, being capable of running all of the other COD games, battlefield 4, the Batman: Arkham series, and the assassin's creed games on high or medium high settings. I don't know that much about PCs, but i am pretty sure that that means that it can run just about anything that could be asked of it if i put it to low. I haven't even been able to turn the multiplayer ON yet!"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't often write reviews unless I really love a product.  This isn't one of those reviews The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing BROKEN. I've tried this on 2 graphics cards, one admittedly way lower than the required (A GT230) (Which can run battlefield 3 and 4 fairly comfortably) and a GTX 760 (Which runs them both on ultra at over 60fps, titanfall on full spec etc)  Load up ghosts. Nvidia optimised settings, playing it safe. .. 1fps. Turn all the settings down to low. 4fps. Turn the resolution down to 800x600. 8fps  Multiplayer I can't even load a map without it crashing (After waiting 10 minutes for it to load in the first place).  What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happened here? Battlefield 4 got massive amounts of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for shipping with a few glitches here and there. This launches completely UNPLAYABLE and broken and gets away with it?  I'm currently getting support from activision to get any kind of resemblance of a game running. If that actually happens and I can play the game for an hour running stable I'll edit this with a fix. That doesn't change the fact they're shipping an essentially broken product. The fact it's been 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing months almost since this was released is inexcuseable.   The ONLY thing not making me more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off about this is that it was gifted to me by a friend. But if this isn't able to actually run on my system i'm demanding a refund for them. Â£90 wasted otherwise.  And for anyone wondering, i'm running an I7 860, GTX760, 16GB RAM, Way above the minimum.    ----------------------  After installing the game on a completely new build sometime later, the game now works. But honestly it's one you can easily skip. Campaign was one of the least interesting of the series, and multiplayer feels like a step backward from Black Ops 2, or Advanced Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"crap game, couldnt even play it, and the support center didnt help at all"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Loust performance on a NVIDIA 970gtx. Major framerate drops and tons of stuttering, even on low settings. Such a crappy performance for an old game. Campaign mission suck. 6 hours and half of it is watching cutscenes of buildings and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ falling down all around you. Mass destruction for dramatic action effect, again, like teh 50 god damn times before. And the characters are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. Not even likable and they advertised this game around using the doig andhe's in it for maybe 5 minutes of ridiculous gameplay. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing waste of money. Lame, ridiculous, moronic. But that doesn't matter, game performance suck to play. Worst CoD ever (and all of them suck).  Multiplayer the performance is worse. And what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is with this AI squads â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t? Playing against computer AI that are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cranked up to ninja levels? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that designed that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ getting owned by a good player, this AI â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing owns you before you take a god damn step. Who was the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing moron that decided that super skilled AI was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun. You fire at an AQI you see that has its back to you it doesn't die but turns around and smokes you with one â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pull of teh trigger. And you can't even hear their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fire sound, until they show you the kill cam which shows you shooting at them for 20 god damn minutes before they fire for one second and kil you. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THAT YOU MORINIC â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S!  Oh, and you have to versus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t to earn points so you can buy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to keep competetive in regular multiplayer. You gotta fight boyts forever to so you can play against real people. Bunch of lames as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  This is the biggest pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t ever to be made and makes sure that I never buy anoth game in this pile of crap serier again. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you CoD, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you and you ignorant and moronic developers to god damn mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hell where I hope you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing burn for fifty eternities.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good game with less hackers. I think this game could be better but for PC its a good casual game. In my opinion this game is obviously a console game and not a PC game. Nobody really plays it and the gameplay is much better at the console as on PC. I wouldn't buy it anymore. If you really want to play this game then go on console for mroe and longer activity about the game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm not a call of duty hater, I played tons of cod on ps3 from the cod mw days to black ops 2... and after 9 hours of giving this game a try i just can't recommend this. It is a laggy mess, it lags even when playing against bots, it lags so bad it almost gives me motion sickness to try to play.. and this is on a high end gaming pc with top of the line hardware using nvidias recommended settings. The story mode is a stereotype of the rail shooter.. ahah I had to wait for a team mate to open up a curtain for me, and if you run to far ahead or try to fight the gunfights in any way the game doesn't want you too, you die instantly... -_-.. go get a fancy 60$ dinner or something instead of buying this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You have a dog, it kills people O.O  10/10 A very uniqe element to an fps ~IGN  .......Nope. Instead of paying 60 bucks to this garbage cod game, go buy yourself a cheesburger or 15 from McDonalds, eat one yourself and give the leftover 14 to your gf because your girlfriend is fat."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bite Size Review - Call of Duty Ghosts The Good: + Ummâ€¦ the one time you control a dog?  The Bad: - Graphics, I actually had to check my computer settings multiple times to find out why the textures were blurry like a 360 game, turns out thatâ€™s just what we got with this port - Story was so boiler plate, no surprises or anything, just â€˜Merica for 4 hours - Multiplayer has died completely, like itâ€™s gone, and this coming from a dude who regularly plays games like CS 1.6 and HL1 Day of Defeat, those games have more people plaything than this one - Itâ€™s the ugly duckling of the CoD franchise, no one thinks it was good, and it was the one I ended up pre-orderingâ€¦ sucks.  The Verdict: This is a really weird game to review. The story was terribly bland, there was no special feature or change about it from other Call of Duties, and itâ€™s multiplayer is pretty much dead. Usually when I write a review, I can make a pretty good arguments for how it is good or bad, and add my personal 2 cents for the verdict to let you know if I think others should play it or not. The problem here is, I honestly cannot think of any reason why this game was better than any of the cheaper (now) games that have better stories and people actually playing their multiplayer. DO NOT BUY. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts, The b*stard child of Infinity Ward who is hated by almost everyone.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If You Want To Play A Good Cod Made By Infinity Ward Then Go Play Cod 4 Or MW2

Call of Duty: Ghosts,already full of hacks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have a state of the art ne computer, and have loaded other ganes...no issues.  I have tried numerous times to load Ghost on my computer, and everytime I go to play it, it says it was shut down wrong, and to go to Read me to find out what to do. Well I did not shut it down, I do not have the slightest clue where 'READ ME:' is even at. I am not a programer, I simply bought the gane to play, and I have never had such a hard â™¥â™¥â™¥ time getting something to load onto a computer; I mean, what ever happened to the just put it in and let it auto load, I will never buy another Call of Duty game again, or any game that requires you to work with this backwards â™¥â™¥â™¥ 'STEAM' program...even trying to get help is a joke. Why can you not just call someone and have them walk you through the process, and wjhy is it such a process to justy load the dam game.. What the result is, is a $59 target me at teh range. I will not recommend any game that requires working with 'STEAM'."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hit badly by hackers and it was dying a month after release. Just get Counter Strike.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT LIKE IT! :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,wood not recommed cas of 2 many hacker and steam can't fix +30gb + u need a good pc but the campian was prety good.... WOOD BE GOOD IF U COULD BUY DOUBLE XP AT ANT TIME CAS ITS HARD 2 LVL UP OR PRESTIVE..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If I could give this a sideways thumb I would.  I don't bother with CoD multiplayer, so this only pertains to the single-player campaign mode. That said, if you dislike the SP gameplay, you'll probably not like the MP gameplay, and vice versa.  I've played every CoD (barring the Black Ops series) since the first. While I've never been a fan of the multiplayer, being more of a BF guy, I've always enjoyed the campaigns. I thought the Modern Warfare series was particularly compelling. As the games have become increasingly 'consolized' the plot and memorable characters have kept me interested. Sadly, I can't say that for Ghosts.  Visually, it's a beautiful game, especially at max settings. This has always been a strength of the series, and Ghosts maintains the tradition. The audio maintains another tradition: weak, tinny gunfire effects. The voice acting is solid, however, and, anemic gunfire notwithstanding, it looks and feels like a big budget Hollywood action flick.  The plot, however, is ridiculous to the point of distraction. While I get that they finished off the Modern Warfare story arc and may have wanted to cut ties with that entirely, the direction they've chosen is just too silly for me. It's almost as if the writers were competing with the creators of Homefront for the most absurd backstory possible, and I say this with full knowledge of the tremendous liberties the series has taken in the past with regard to geopolitics and military matters. Let's just say that, in the future, Tier 1 operators will be strapping GoPros to the foreheads of German Shepherds and mind-melding with them to take down soldiers of a Bolivarian superpower dictatorship in the now-overgrown streets of San Diego. That's enough to turn a lot of people away.  Still, a shooter's a shooter, regardless of plot. Unfortunately, Ghosts fails to impress. I'm not sure if it's a function of limited FOV, the game's mechanics, or simply design decisions, but the controls feel sloppy, clunky, and inaccurate. The annoying-yet-obligatory stealth sequences suffer from a total lack of any indicator as to whether you're hidden or not. Weapon variety is lacking, and what guns are available don't feel very distinctive. Weapon switching is awkward, and movement is cumbersome. It just feels like a console shooter, not a PC shooter.   I got this on sale. After about six hours of play I'm through the campaign. There's a collectible (like the intel from previous series) that is supposed to provide a reason to replay missions, but I frankly don't care enough to complete that part of the game. For the amount I paid, I don't feel cheated, but this is a throw-away game for me that I'll uninstall and forget. It's also likely the last CoD I'll purchase."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is way to easy. First game I got a 26 kill streak final score 27/3  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,How to get a refund. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IT SUCKS -10 out of 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so bad it gave me PTSD.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great if you love betraying your friends; autobalance now moves new players to the full team instead of the empty team, and when they spawn in, if you too are on the full team, you can kill them :D  I'm with the one guy, this game is totally worth buying for your worst enemy. That's truly the only way to get your money's worth out of it.  Truly hope that IW never gets another game contract again, because 10 months of the thing running like an untested beta has done nothing but prove that they're a joke."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sadly I bought this, it has got to be one of the blandest war games ever, visually good but not atmoshpere whatsoever, The game has no depth or immersiveness and doesn't engage you at all you feel like a spare part just pickin up the pieces.  God Know how they came up this the Min Specs for this, i can't see anything Special!!!!!!! It shames the 'Call of Duty' name. It's not worth the amount if Diskspace it takes and a ridiculous amount of ram.  Multiplayer is a complete joke if you haven't played it from day 1. I have never seen such an unbalanced MP. Start lvl 1 and you come up against players at 15-12 What a Joke, Dead in seconds.  This games is a case of all Boast but no Balls.  Sticking to Bad Company 2  This has put me off buy BF4  What a Disaster. Save yourself some Doh Thank God i didn't pay for the digital hardened edition  More like a 'release it anyway on PC' tie-in due to PS4 &amp; XBoxOne Launches (Funny That?)"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IT SUCKS -10 out of 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so bad it gave me PTSD.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT LIKE IT! :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is worse than Donald Trump. (honestly i thought the multiplayer was ok for ten bucks but dont even bother buying it)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a review strictly based on multiplayer- as that is the only reason I bought it and I have only played like, the first mission in the campagin.   I pre-ordered this on steam and I was fairly excited for it to come out. I played it and was completely dissapointed. I just built my computer and It is capable of running the game at high-ultra settings. Even then the graphics sometimes look like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I checked online- it isnt only me. The maps arent all that great, to be completely honest and there seems to be a few hackers already. I dont know what that's about considering the game just came out (pay not attention to the 'vac ban record' on my page- was put into a hacked lobby and banned from mw2). The guns are okay though. But I dont think the 6gb min of ram and newest video cards are worth it. I cant see any appealing differences between this and BO2. I think last year's COD actually looks BETTER.   TLDR: For the price tag, this game isnt worth it. Not for multiplayer, at least. Stick with Black Ops 2 or something of the sort. Better maps, guns, visuals, easier to run, and it makes the most out of the engine."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Get thee console experience with a locked 60fov in singleplayer without using 3rd part software
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i bought this game for extinction only, only to find out that the servers are always down...like all the time, so i decided to do some multiplayer...game crashes every time, played campaign and was done with ghosts"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What more can you ask from a CoD game?  You have campers, silencers, shotgunners, annyoing dogs, thermal scopes that are impossibly amazing. This game is just great.  End me "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i meet the OTT Recommended System Requirements and the games still choppy as hell Â£1000 pc and the fps is all over the place could be a good game if this gets fixed till then stay away from this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"3rd worst COD, the worst is infinate warfare and the 2nd worst is advance warfare. its a bad game.....dont get it, I got it for $6 on â™¥â™¥â™¥ but if ur going to pay over $6 or even over 1 cent dont...this game is trash and no one is online....there are like 7 ppl a time only on team deathmatch, dont buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought it for 10$, still not worth it. The game would be good if you actualy had a chance to play it. The game is amazing but you can't play it. You go play 2 games online and after that it kicks you out and says 'Unable to verify VAC status' that message will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you really bad, you calidate the game's cache, stops these messages from appearing for a while but after 5 games it will appear again. Oh if that isn't enough i have some kinda bug where half of the players hand model is like glass and you can see through it, same with some guns."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a perfectly compentent Call of Duty game, but it's a huge step backwards from last year's Black Ops II in almost every way (in both the campaign and multiplayer). Unless you absolutely need to feed that nasty fix of yours (like I had to, because I'm a crazy person), avoid this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No more activision, it's dead"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Season pass too much expensive !!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I never thought a 2013 game with such a reputation like call of duty would look so horrible and have such a bad gameplay
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excuse,I have problem it's error file 7 when game loading in the mission 2 ,I can't play.some body help me how can I do it?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very poorly optimised for PC, still stutters on the menu screen"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said before but this game was shockingly horrible. Almost on par with World War Z (movie) and War Z (game). Both just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Step brothers said it best, 'I have a belly full of white dog crap in me, and now you lay this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on me?' Just a awful, awful Satan ridden piece of crap. I want a refund and I didn't even pay for this.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD in the COD History ever.This Game is full with hackers, bad optimasition and its not entertaining. Dont buy this Game go buy COD4 or Black Ops 2 or something else But dont BUY THIS CRAP. This is a rip off. This is my last COD I think..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I understand its hard to make a significant improvement in every sequel a developer makes. I mean how much can you change the concept of a FPS game? But still..... CoD series give you the feeling of doing exactly same crap in every game over and over again. I really do not recommend this game to anyone. AI is bad and the graphics are terrible! Playing on highest possible and maaan, its rediculous. It feels like they trying to milk their 10 years old game engine for as long as possible. And the game mechanics/gameplay is absolutely the same as in all the prequels. The only plus I can give is for the envoirements but as I said, game engine feels like its too old. I think I will never spend my money on Call Of Duty again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Id rather drink bleach.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Got banned for changeing my games resolution.  Would resoution again 11/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Alright I changed my mind. Game is terrible. Just bad. Don't even try.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am not interested in the slightest to play the CoD: Ghosts multiplayer. It is the same exact boring playstyle that was old by the end of CoD4.  So far I have enjoyed the single-player campaign, but overall it is not that great either. Forcing mouse acceleration makes me wonder if they have a child that has never played a computer game making the design decisions.  Then we run into the big problem. DX11 is required to play. That is the most outrageous thing I have ever heard of and it is absolutely unacceptable. The is nothing in the CoD game engine that makes it so the game requires DX11. This is just lazy and yet another middle finger to the consumer from Infinity Ward. Not to mention that the requirement for DX11 is not highlighted in the least.  With a requirement that is unheard of, as in I don't know of a single game other than CoD: Ghosts that requires you to have a DX11 video card, Infinity Ward should face some serious penalties monetarily for sneaking that in. I can list about 50 games that absolutely blow CoD: Ghosts out of the water when it comes to graphical requirements, and not a single one of those games even require DX10 to play. Sure you need DX11 and an awesome card to experience those games to their fullest potential, but you can play.  The Radeon HD 6850 I am using won't work with CoD: Ghosts. The reason? DX11. The card supports it, but you have to flash the bios to update it to work with DX11. Flashing a video card bios, even to extremely avid gamers, is not something that is easy to do. Most people just don't have that technical skill. Not to mention that flashing your bios is a dangerous task even if you know what you are doing.  Overall I give the game a 6 out of 10 for the single-player campaign. I give it a 2 out of 10 for multi-player, as there is nothing new or innovative about reskinning some weapons and making some maps that take about 20 minutes. Factor in the required DX11 and I give it a 0 out of 10 for one of the most ridiculously idiotic decisions to have ever come from a major game studio."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ate my ram worse then chrome
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What the actual fk is this ?! This game is completely garbage. Wanted to play this with friends online but guess what ?! There are nearly no players. After ten minutes we found a match. The enemys were camping inside the castle all the time and as one of them reached the dog streak they spammed the chat to come to the castle and let the dog make love to us. ...  The Singleplayer is ok thoe but there was helicopters coming out of the floor and disappearing in walls.  By these experiences i can not recommend anybody to buy this game. Maybe if you want to commit suicide but dont have a particular reason. Just buy this game ( make sure you pay the full 60 $ on steam instead of buying this trash on a keysite) try to play for like an hour, I guarantee you won't need any more time. And your sanity will drop to 0.09 %. Now you can kill yourself. But dont forget to mention that Infinity Ward takes all the credits for your death because they messed up the game way too much.  I hope that you dont buy this game and kind regards  The big friendly Stoner"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible game, multiplayer played horribly, literally the only important part of CoD games........ everyone should be refunded for this crap, keep CoD off of steam FFS, feels like a bunch of idiots who made an attrocious port"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Decent Game with LOTS of bugs, rehashed cut scences, Story feels like the other CoDs just thrown together, A LOT of sh!t in this game costs Money, some of the worst MP maps ever &amp; pretty bad graphics even on Ultra. I don't recommend this Game for such a high price."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well FU*K COD GHOSTS lol am jking its good on pc IF YOU GOT 50 GBS AND 6 RAM if you dont and you only have 30GBS then you can run the game but you cant play it cuz its a black thing??? anyways its good game and i got it for a CD so damm it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am casual gamer and I don't do multi-player(for many years now) so please understand that my comments apply to the single player campaign portion of the game. Here it goes:  We tend to forget the pain we experience. Until we are reminded of it. This latest installment of the COD franchise reminded me of the pain I experienced a year ago when the previous installment was release with much fanfare. This latest release is so bland, so linear, so constricted, the great graphics(when they don't stutter) cannot offset game's single player shortcomings.  Yes, the game graphics are impressive but so do many its contemporaries. Just take a look at Metro 2033 or BioShock Infinite! Both games run circles around latest COD franchise installment!  If you are looking for a smooth running game, this is not the game for you. If you are looking for a good storyline, this is not the game for your.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, so firstly, the single-player is ok - not great, but ok. Multi-player: I have not touched because I know there is nothing there for me there. I will cut the game some slack, as the one thing that they did good on, was the Extinction mode. I really enjoyed playing this game mode with my friends, but still $20.00 for each map pack is just not worth it. In conclusion, only buy the game and the DLC when it's on sale, and if you have friends to play with, otherwise skip it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the wort PC game! The game itself is good, but the PC optimization really really poor! Also, multiplayer almost empty most of the time only 200-400 player around the world. Save your money and get either black ops 2 or advance warfare."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Must say - I didn't really like this one. For sure - the weakest of all CoD series I have played so far.  First of all - it is short. Single playere campagin of 8 hours, for a weak player like me, is much too little. Don't even want to imagine how many hours would a hardcore gamer need for this... 3 ? Secondly - I didn't really found any characters I can feel attached to. Well, maybe except for Railey, but I'm a hardcore dog lover, so... Graphics feel somehow old, like there were no real improvement from Modern Warfare 3 - ok, I know there was, but I didn't really felt that during play. Still - graphics gave me issues while lounching the game and during play too. The game 'likes' to crash with no apparent reason from time to time, and while digging in that I found that graphics are sometimes responsible. Maybe it is only in my case, but still... Finally - I feel like it was somehow overdone in action. Sure, it is still CoD, famous for its intense, explosive action, but in here - it's gone a little too far.  On the other hand the story itself seems to be good, but still could have been a little more realistic. While playing MW3 I felt like it was overdone, but still somehow possible. Here - well, fun, but you don't have this probability factor... The level design is also good - even with all the issues mentioned earlier I still loved the underwater 'sink the ship' level. And space fighting is also nice.  In general - I'm happy I bought it over allegro (polish equivalent of eBay, though we have a polish eBay too) for really cheap, otherwise I would be really angry I spent my hard earned money on that..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all i can say!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's Laggy and NOT Fun at all People are always raging.  That's why i love playing Battlefield 2,3,4 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am so full of rage right now it's unreal. I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&amp;c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one. I hope those pr*cks at Activition read this and I hope half the f*cking gaming world does becuase this is not acceptable"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ItÂ´s no really good game. Desire and deception. No need more analysis.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the wort PC game! The game itself is good, but the PC optimization really really poor! Also, multiplayer almost empty most of the time only 200-400 player around the world. Save your money and get either black ops 2 or advance warfare."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"How to play this game:  1. Buy and Install the game. 2 . Instantly play the Multiplayer. 3. Start a round while waiting 5 Minutes  because only 400 people play this game, 4. Drop into the round. Your Loadout is not important. 5. You die on every corner because all guys are camping with tripmines (I.E.D.). 6. Press ALT+F4 and sell your steam account to a dumbass who would pay for this game. 7. You just wasted money and time with this game. Congrats."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Would not recommend...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very good cod game even if ppl dont llike it but there is so much hacker i stoped playing after 30 hours because of the frustration
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"wow, many years later... this is absolutely horrible.. with a good story"

Call of Duty: Ghosts,it dose not lanch for me i press play but it says lanching so i wait 15 but still so i wait 1hour still this ha snever happend
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When I played this game I thought, hey, the last CoD wasnt that bad, graphics were nice and guns were cool. Loved the story to. Then I played this. I thought the saying was if needed take 1 step back to take 2 steps forward, not jump off a building while setting yourself on fire. This games graphics are atrocious. Makes the minecraft look like the mona lisa. Story isnt that bad and I have no lag or freezing whatsoever. Guns feel bland and dull, every gun feels the same and shoots the same really. AI is a joke with 3 methods: 1) Be in the open and die. 2) Throw a grenade which btw, the grenade indicator looks like it came from CoD 1, and yes the explosion is very little and it does instant kill. 3) Bash you 2 times quickly killing you. The dog mechanic is forced on you to use in story and is overall a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ more then actually useful, thing runs at Mach 5 with sprint. Lots of cutscenes so far with smash this button and that button. No choices that I have seen, not like Black ops 2 anyways. Game also seems very short in all honesty, just started playing now and I think I have only 5 more missions to go. Get this game for online only but even then I would steer towards Battlefield 4, much nicer graphics and customization."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Lets just say this game is complete trash. there are like a total of 200 people playing on pc.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you love to have minus framerate on a great gaming pc, and if you want to waste your money on dlc, buy this! "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is good as usual in Call of Duty but also very, very short. Under water and space missions are damn nice and have an little James Bond Moonraker touch. Although I`d would have been nice to have the option to make different choices like in Black Ops 2.  Now about the multiplayer, I think the main reason most people, including me, buy this game. The performance of the MP is very poor, a lot of lags which still have not been fixed so far. Also most of the maps, compared to Modern Warefare 2 and Black Ops 2, are way to big and so the gameplay gets very boring for my opinion. I also think the perk system is way to overload this time.  In sum, the multiplayer feels like a big beta, which is not to recommend at the moment. I hope this will get fixed soon. Also pre order bonuses like the 'Into Deep Player Pack' from Amazon do not work and the Activision support has no clue how to fix anything. Bonuses form Call of Duty Elite do not work for Steam players and so on. The app is crap! That is all to say about the new Call of Duty app.  Update 03.03.2014: The game is still very laggy, you can`t find any lobbys in HC and russian hackers are everywhere!!! No support from Activion against cheaters instead they offer their crap camo dlc bullcrap!!! Do something against cheaters all you have in mind is $ $ $!!! I will never buy any freakin COD!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worse COD Game EVER!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game 10% sucks 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will  5% pleasure  50% pain and 0% reason to purchase this game

Call of Duty: Ghosts,very bad cod game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs fine on my gaming PC but then again, it is pretty overkill and I still get some framerate drops. So it can run good for me but what about all the people with problems? My friend has such an OVERKILL gaming pc yet it won't even boot the game, he has tried so many fixes.  I also own the game on console but it just doesnt seem like COD, Black Ops II was 1000000x better.  PROS Graphics  CONS Everything else really :/  So there, thats my honest opinion on this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's good to play with buddies and what not, but as far as the CoD series goes it really has gone pretty down hill. I'll give it credit for being better than CoD: Black Ops 2, but then I don't think they could possibly make a CoD game worse than BO2. So far Black Ops 1 has been the only multiplayer I've really enjoyed thus far. Personally, I wouldn't go just by ratings because you will find people crying 'this is the worst CoD yet' on every CoD game. It probably just varies upon your own taste."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want to play CoD, buy MW2 instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad optimisation for PC, VAC bannes for changing ur FOV, kids that act like 30 yr olds and camper â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, over priced, same as MW3. un realistic.      1/10 Gave it 1 cuz the story is not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."

No problem, CoD Ghosts will make you feel great, this is the place for you.  All in all, a big piece of garbage. A game for the poor and unskilled.  P.S.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even on a beefy super computer built by nasa finest. IW doesn't know how to make a pc game at all, and they should probably stop making games in general. At least Treyarch tries to make a good pc port and they made one last year with Black Ops 2. Seriously though you can make this game look like cod 2 on low and it runs at barely 30 frames and it drops constently. Do not buy it for 6 months or just pass on it because they don't deserve your money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very bad PC port Don't buy it on PC!! ---------------------------- PS: Game is fixed after it become a 'Ghost town'
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not that great in my opinion, while I don't seem to suffer from the fps and lag issues that others players rant on about, it still feels like a subpar experience as a whole. The extinction map was fun (alien version of zombies) but it doesn't last nearly as long as they seem to think it should (you level up in it like mulitplayer) becuase there are like 4 levels of prestige for it (each prestige level is capped to level 30). The WORST part of the game is easily the spawn points, I have't been killed 1-2 seconds within my spawn so many times since the N64 days. Guns are ok, rather generic. I liek the idea of createing new squad members as you prestige. Instead of starting all over you begin another soldier on your squad. To get patchs and icons you have to be on the opperation that fits the patch or icon so you cant really go for a specific unlock which seeme kinda silly.   10-15% of games have a actual aim botting hacker in them and the player base has shrunk so small that the only games you can even play are teamdeath matchs and if you wait a long time you might get a search and rescue (the new S+D)  I wouldn't recomend the game unless you are a die hard CoD fan, there is fun to be had here, but the community of gamers for the PC version is poor."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer with this lobby â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is just awful. Extinction can make a lot of fun. I have about 950 hours only extinction. If you like coop gamemodes you can buy it. but I think it's not worth the full price. Try to get a cheap key.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad graphics. Cod formula at its worst. Boring, corridor shooter.  This is supposed to be a story about covert ops, the ghosts, but it plays like a simple, generic shooter. Completely uninspired. Dont waste your time or money on this crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS THE SHITEST GAME EVER MADE FULL OF CAMPING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THAT DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY (LIKE DANIEL AND GAY) DONT BUY IT ITS FULL OF CRAP NOT WORTH THE 60 $  GO BUY HOT COFFE ITS MUCH BETTER AND MUCH CHEAPER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horribly optimized port. The game would be enjoyable if you could play this at a steady 60 fps on an overclocked GTX780, seriously what the fock Infinity Ward. If I want to run this game fairly well I have to put everything on low. This is completely outrageous as Battlefield 4 is a lot better looking and I can maintain well over 70 frames on UItra. Activision if you're going to release a game for a system, make sure the developers actually did their focking job for once. Treyarch still makes good games and quality content, sadly though, I think this is the nail in the coffin for the Call of Duty franchise. I love Treyarch's games, but this is probably going to have to be the last Call of Duty game I purchase. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward, you pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. This game started out on PC and now you abandon the players that helped you start out. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off I hope Titanfall kills this franchise off, sorry Treyarch find a new IP please I'll most likely buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wait till it's free....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is not what i would call next gen and i will tell my friends not to buy this and buy BF4 (much much better game)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is such a failure   10/10 Whould delete again and whine about not getting their money  Play Counter strike for some real amusement

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This franchise needs a fresh breath, not more money grabbing theiving schemes.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,i don't recommend this game you know why?? 1. the multiplayer is suck  2. it has some glitch and bug 3. too easy even on veteran level 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THIS IS THE WORST CALL OF DUTY EVER!!!! DON'T BUY IT, ONLY 300 PLAYERS/DAY!!!!!! THE MAPS ARE BAD, THE MAX GRAPHICS ARE BAD TOO!!!! YOU BETTER BUY THE CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS 2 !!!! 12.000 PLAYERS EVERY DAY, AWESOME MAPS AND GRAPHICS!!! THIS GAME IS A BIG â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!! PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, TRUST ME, YOU WILL SEE!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Recommend? Yeah, well. It's hit or miss for most players at the moment. Multiplayer is a mess. Squads is fun enough except the scoring system is completely messed up. Some can't even get the game to run.  Personally, I've been able to run the game just fine. I haven't bothered with Multiplayer since MW2. The hackers and cheaters have just ruined the experience, hence why there are so few players online at any given hour of the day. They just don't seem to care to address the issues or are incapable of doing so.  So, no, I would not recommend it at this time. Wait a few months until it goes on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Before...... I got the Hardened Edition. Well the single player is really good. Game has great potential but blah blah blah.  After....... As of 2014 this game is worthless POS. With cheating becoming s sport ,and pre buy schemes popular companys just making a fast buck and moving on. only single play is good. But multiplayer games dont have the security to make a honest dollar. This game is worth 10 bucks. I know now that were all gonna have to wait a generation for games to evolve to some sort of highly regulatied never used gaming for a non-cheating play.  In the end its a waste of money and lots of your time no matter how you see it ."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Comes with always the same fun and adventue but every year the fun gets a bit less than the previous year! Altogether, a nice and a very small game (completed in 5hrs) but not as good as to recommend it for other PC users!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A reskinned version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 with improved graphics and a worser story line. Multi player is dead and the CoD community is terrible. Would only recommend it for the single player when the price is â‚¬5.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Once I had a dream. This dream was that I could grow up to be a world class recorder player. I would practice my recorder for hours trying to improve. My parents would yell at me for not doing my homework, they would sometimes hide my recorder. One day my dad broke my recorder because I failed my maths test. It broke my heart and I ran away. After spending some time with a autistic priest by the name of Pubert, I returned home with the skill of being able to hide my recorder in my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. My parents were never able to find my recorder again. Although having a recorder up your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is generally not a good thing, it gave me major hemorrhoids that made it impossible to move. The hemorrhoids eventually combined to make a anal block which then spread to my brain making me mentally disabled. After a few years I had been cured of my disorder but it was all for nothing because this game made me gain an extra chromosome anyway. 11/10 would bang"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, WASTED OVER 15 HOURS OF MY TIME. ALSO A WATSE OF MONEY, HATE THAT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING JUNK. HATE COD GHOSTS PC. NEVER EVER BY THIS 'WORKING' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bad game ever   many of errors, freezes, crashes   SLI problem"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its really bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst f)(* game ever! Not even talking about the sh@ty graphics engine, I'm talking about the game as a whole. Thank you steam for your no refund policy...enjoy my wasted money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For starters, the fact you need at least 6 GB of RAM to lay the game is a joke, specially when it only ever uses 3GB at most. Next, when you have the required RAM, the game still seems to drop frames, even when you run it on medium quality with a decent graphics card. The campian was alright, but just felt like a really lazy attempt for a rehasing of old content by Activision."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothing new here as has been the case for along time with COD however I usually get my moneys worth from COD each year when I want to play a mindless fps every so often. That being said this one is horrible in a number of ways. While the single player game is what you would expect and is entertaining to play sitting on the couch in front of my big screen. The multiplayer more frustrating than ever before.   - FOV  - There is no FOV slider and even with the 3rd party ones it looks horrible. It may just be me but it looks like the image is 720p and upscaled on my 1080p 27' monitor when I set the FOV to 90 or 100 - MP gameplay you die fast  - Hits on you don't register until you are already dead with no way to retalitate. If you watch the kill cam your enemy will have gotten 9 hits on you but from your perspective only 3 registered before you are dead. Someone posted a good video about this on youtube.  Audio  - Unlike COD MW3, where you could select from a variety of audio options such as stereo, 5.1, etc.. This does not include any of those. While that might seem like a minor grap it would be nice considering I have a decent paid of headphones with 7.1.    Unlike others, I have only experienced minor technical issues but I have already uninstalled the game. This game will be down to $30 in no time (have seen it already for $48 on GMG)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game on PC. Mostly because the community on PC is very small. Most of the time there's not even enough people to find a good game on ground war. Only TeamDeathMatch and Domination have enough people playing at all time. The single player campaign is fun but way too short. Unless you play only TeamDeathMatch and during peak hours, I recommend this game on console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The inability to change your Field Of View bothers me, even though it's a easy fix by downloading a third-party program I think there's no excuse to not include it in this game.. ESPECIALLY since it was available in previous Call of Duty games. The campaign? I enjoyed it a lot, just that the ending was pretty stupid in my opinion.. If you know what I mean, it was all great until those last like 20 seconds.. But I guess that's there way of making an excuse for a sequel. So onto the multiplayer, it's pretty much the same. Except, Infinity Ward changed how the perks work which I really really like, but I feel like you run out of perk combonations relatively quickly through-out playing the game. I also think there's not enough game modes, and there's not enough guns. I mean-- I thought there was supposed to be a new engine.. So wouldn't that allow more content? Right right? Nope! Apparently not. The character customization is different, but not *that* great.. I mean it's not like anyone was begging for it, I think it's just another gimmicky feature added to try and reel people into buying their game in my opinion. The extinction mode is cool, but nothing new. They should really just make those survival modes Call of Duty makes standalone games.. I mean, aliens are a baby step away from zombies but at least they introduce different kinds of them you have to take down, instead of them just getting more health every round. I've heard it's similar to Gears of War's survival mode but sadly I wouldn't know, I've only ever played it once and I vaguely remember my experience. As far as I remember, you could buy defenses and guns just like in this but whatever.  Overall? It's an ok game, it's a Call of Duty game. Definately not worth 60 dollars, wait until the price drops on black friday if it even does but I highly doubt it. I wouldn't really recommend this game to anyone, it's just a game I have for when I get bored of other first-person shooters. Spend you money wisely!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the technical flaws drag this game down. it has a good story, good voice acting, and good action. but it feels like a step back from the overall quality of black ops II. graphics quality is decent but nowhere as good as battlefield 4. it does not live up to the hype."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game - piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good Campaing but Short ========&gt;&gt; 7/10 Bad MultiPlayer, Bad Maps, Players Cheating Every Single Match (Like P2W Games), Bad Prestige ========&gt;&gt; 4/10 OverAll ========&gt;&gt; 5.5/10 Not Worth It ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the worst multiplayer experience of any COD title to date. as the series loses credibility with each installment, at least we got one with a cute dog in it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Money successfully wasted on another CTRL+C CoD, unfortunately."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gameplay - 10/10 Quality of Port - 10/1000000, Just terrible!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont recommand
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game isnt that great.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has the best story of any CoD game I've ever played, but it is still Call of Duty and it sucks. The multiplayer is terrible, and the matchmaking system doesn't exist. I live on the east coast of the US and get put with people from japan. 3/10, bad game with a price that never drops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the most horible game I've ever bought, smh and these updates aren't solving the on going problem.  I'm deffinantly not pre-ordering another Call of Duty game ever! Some beta testing would be great in solving this crap for a game sad just sad.  IW needs to get it together."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst purchase ive made...Game is sooooo bad recommend on console! poorly optimized
Call of Duty: Ghosts,have an 8core amd and still lag like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 2gig 256bit gpu its crap rather slit my throat

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I had originally intended to write a well structured accurate, well versed review for this game when I bought it on release.  Frought with issues I had decided not to on the basis that this title was not yet fit to be reviewed to any standard deemed acceptable or honest as the game was clearly a botched port of a badly coded, cookie cutter, contrived and out right copy pasta plagiarism of earlier titles. This game was not yet fit for the PC form factor and alas, after 60+ hours spread over several years, waiting . . . . hoping, that the next time I drop into the game there will be some kind of optimisation for modern hardware, some kind of SSAO that worked or for that matter any aspect of this games visuals.   Without going into too much detail, using either one graphics card or two, performance is still bad. Using six - eight core cpu's intel or amd . . . poor performance and utilisation, game data files loaded on ssd's in raid 0 almost 1gb/s read write?  You guessed it, poor performance.  Now the Call Of Duty series was always drama done badly, this was it's charm, how absurd and unrealisitc it was and how you could call in a tactical nuke after your kill streak, shooting someone with an rpg after spinning aroung in the air like a tweaking meth addict at a disco and scoring a headshot with a ballistic knife afterwards at range.   There were some fun times, but that was when I was at the age of 17 - 18. I am 25 now and nothing has changed in those years, nothing has improved, sales of this game are obviously dropping to better more refined titles,   Put simply IW. After MW2 you should have stopped and let it die.  Stop reanimating this corpse, let it rest. Come up with some new ideas? I Mean it's not like you don't have the financial power to do so. reinvent something different or perhaps go back to your roots, when you made games WORTH buying.  Games that people used to sit up all night playing and turn up late for work or school.   Honestly I can never see this happening and if there is one thing that anyone takes from this.  Look at indie sales of classic genre games, look at terreria, look at the roguelikes, consider those classic shooters like Killing Floor2 starting out as a mod and making it to early access, being barely half finished and playing 100x better than this drivel you persist on regurgitating, year on year on our gaming networks, You are no better than apple.  The company as a whole has become a laughing stock among the gaming community and shall remain that way as long as you continue to churn out this 'standard' of game and until that changes this will only continue to decline for IW and TA.  Ask yourself why these indie titles are doing so well, and why re releases of classic are destroying AAA's right now. Figure that one simple question out . . . and you've got yourself a game.    "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game would maaaybe be worth buying if it is on sale for like $10. The install is huge, it is poorly optimaized, the graphical fidelity is just atrocious, and after looking through countless forums on steam and variuous websites, I still can't get the multiplayer to work. Overall, a terrible PC game. Do not buy unless discounted to the point of single digit dollars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please don't get this game, it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke. I like CoD and I might even be a fanboy of it, but over 50 hours played, I have came to a conclusion.  This game is an absolute piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this only good thing about it is the doge.  If you want a good CoD Game, pick up a copy of Black Ops II, one of my favorite games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought the game to make this review   dvggfsxzhkfjksdnf  11/10 best review
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game, and the series for that matter, is chock full of the most whiny folks I've ever gamed with. You kill a player a couple of times and they start yelling cheater. I'm a fairly mediocre player and I've been the victim of it more times than I can count. The whiners report you and to my surprise it actually has effect with Infinity Ward. If you are banned you have no recourse and you lose your online playablility, permanently. Infinity Ward says they thoroughly investigate the claims but I'm here to tell you it's not true. So if you want to gamble your investment in time and money on today's mood of an employee at IW by all means buy the game. Too bad because its one of the best fps games playability-wise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crashes frequently. Can't get past The Hunted Level even though I have everything updated and greatly meet the minimum specs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not recommended...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it frezes after the helicoper. it sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game really sucks!!!! Total waste of money and hard drive space !!!!! They just should stop making games.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you want to waste you're money buy this game I always had troubleshoot issues about 90% of the time. Also the resolution would never adjust to my screen and when I tryed to adjust it my self the game would crash and then when I tryed to re-open the game it would just crash. When I looked on the internet for reasons it said that some reasons would be that I didn't have the sufficient hardware but when I checked steam I did.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infested with hackers and ruining the experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad storyline, bad multiplayer. Simply not a fun game to play "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,singleplayer in common is dissapointing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD: Ghosts is extremely lackluster. It lacks CS:GO's competitiveness and feels like a spawn--&gt;kill--&gt;get shot, rinse and repeat every 10 seconds."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i dont like it. the guns kill way to quickly. the spawns can be annoying. not as annoying as how big the maps are. it seems painful to level your character. if you dont know what youre doing you can waste a lot of time and resouces.   its cool to take the next step and be innovative but this was a painful one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm very disapointed by this game. I've played every call of duty since probably its beginning and nothing changed since Modern Warfare 2. It looks okay, but it's simply boring and old. Sure there are few nice new tricks, but game seems outdated. Performance was poor for me when BF4 runs nicely."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pre-ordered this game.... but why. This game is just a money wast, the game laggs on my beast pc. I also spoke to a couple other playes and the game laggs as well by them. So dont wast your time and money to play this game beacause its just a scam......!  Blackshadow"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its an alright game I guess, its more realistic but the gameplay is bad, the maps arent too good and extinction mode is way too hard. The only good thing about this game is the campaign, its better than all the other cods campaigns.If you want a game just for the campaign and single player, definatly get this but if you want it for the online get black ops 2 or Modern Warefare 3. Personally I'd give it a rating of 4.5/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"For some time now, Call of Duty has been regarded by a vocal minority as a soulless annual cash grab, lacking innovation and epitomizing everything that's wrong with modern gaming. I've always felt this reputation was undeserved. Each of the Modern Warfare games still rank among my favorite games of all time; they had tight gameplay mechanics, amazing action set-pieces, and in spite of their over-the-top ridiculous, sometimes nigh incomprehensible plots, the characters were well-written and voice-acted and genuinely likeable. I felt that Modern Warfare 2 was the highlight of the series, and I put more than 300 hours into the game between the campaign and multiplayer.  I'm disappointed, then, that with Ghosts I'm beginning to understand what detractors have been saying about Call of Duty for so long. There is almost nothing novel or interesting in this game to someone who has played previous Call of Duty titles; the sole exceptions, in my mind, are the space and underwater missions, but they're far too short-lived to redeem the overall experience. The characters are bland at best and actively irritating at worst, and all attempts at emotionally involving the player fall completely flat.  The multiplayer doesn't fare much better. Call of Duty has always made itself more accessible with a compressed skill gap relative to games like Counter-Strike and Battlefield, but that's been fine until now. Previous titles have been well-enough balanced to support different playstyles and allow players to capitalize on their unique capabilities. But with each new game the balance has shifted further and further toward being a complete spray-fest with enough random elements to render all skill (or lack thereof) moot. In Ghosts, many if not most guns kill in only 2-3 shots, and most of the maps are small enough that there's rarely any advantage to opting for semi-automatic gun with greater accuracy. The best strategy is always to just pick an assault rifle or SMG and spray, spray, spray.  I miss Modern Warfare 2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game  2/10  do not buy(its like 5/10 on consoles buy it on that)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can't even run it, and I meet all the requirements, crashes at the first menu :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,!WARNING! Don't buy this game! It is full of lag. Maps are too big and infested with campers. This is not a Call of Duty game. Save youreself a lot of frustration and some money. Stick with Modern Warfare 2 and 3. -Twilux-
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is so bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst of the COD series - and thats saying a lot. SP is done in 4 hours. Multiplayer is laggy. Maps uninspired. The perks are almost as bad as MW2. No dedicated servers. I only bought this game because it was on sale for the SP and feel really burned by it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player graphics, even as a games programmer myself did make me wonder how they did certain things. The single player I think is the best and sadly the only thing 'barely' entertaining about this. I stopped the single player due to boredom about four times till I completed it.  Sadly there is no mystery to this game, everything is served up immediately with very little to no community aspect in game. I was very dissapointed as I expected an extension/update (or rather evolvement) to Black Ops 2. It is no longer produces that fast paced adrenalin rush that all previous COD games have hit nicely. It did require a 'day 1' patch, to be playable...which was released nearly a week later. No word from the developers on this, you had to go looking yourself for the fixes. I have played near 75 hours of this and quite franky it is making me wanting to go out and push harder to find a job, a job is more fun. The complexity of the maps, makes it so that you have to check every damn corner. For any guide that helps with levelling fast the solution is 'just camp'.  Honestly I think anyone who purchased this should get all the previous COD (+map packs) games for free instantly, it is absolutely shocking how much they have ripped customers in this leg of the brand.  Do not get me started on the community online site, it is just dire. I am in the process of trying to delete my account on it.  I am sorry Activision, I think you may destroyed your 'whole' fan base with this release."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Mediocre single player experience. It's essentially one big turret mission. Turgid. Enjoyed World at War and Black Ops single player more than this. Multiplayer is much of the usual frantic running around and shooting. Regret buying this. Bought into the hype again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poorly optimized garbage. I can run Black Ops 2 at 120 frames per second maxed except for anti-aliasing, but this doesn't even hold 40. Turning down video options does not significantly improve fps and makes the game look awful. The FOV is capped at 65 and it makes me feel like I'm running around with binoculars strapped to my face. This is marketed as the 'next gen' Call of Duty, but it doesn't look significantly better than previous titles and the gameplay remains pretty much the same, except with this iteration it's slower paced, the maps are bigger, and the player cap is lower, which makes for an overall boring experience. Skip this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD: Modern Combat Unrefined would be a great alternate title for this game. I don't blame activision for this monstrosity of a game, I blame Infinity Ward. I'd bet my left nut that when Treyarch gets COD back in their court that the game will be phenomenal once again. Until then I hope BF4 will be able to fill the gap for you all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a tough one for me, do I enjoy playing online? the answer would be yes and no, Like all CODs it is plauged by not having dedicated servers which means depending on who is hosting you can have an advantage or dissadvantage many times I have thought I was the first to see and shoot a player but then watching the kill cam the enemy clearly had a drop on me, this can be extremley frustrating at times but it wil happen on both sides. Single player mode was pointless in my view granted I won't be to judegemental as I can say it only kept my attention for about 2 hours, if you are a fan of the franchise you probablly wont have any issues with this game. If you are not I would stay away  PROS -Fast run and gun style game play -Feels just how you would expect a COD game to play -Diverse classes and weapons -Awesome perk system  CONS -Controls are clunky and not optimzed for PC -Lack of players, the game has been out for almost a year and you wont find more than about 1,000 players online -Graphics, they are what you would expect from an xbox360 I see no jump from COD4 to this title -No dedicated servers -Host changing stops game play for up to 1 minute -No multiplayer balancing you can play games with 2 on 8 -Most weapon skins and reticles are only for purchase -Handicap from low rank to high rank to far apart  To sum it up, yes I do enjoy playing this time to time but there is no way it is worth $59.99 if this were to go on sale under $25 it would be worth picking up, otherwise hang tight for a few months until BO3 is released"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i swear a poop stick made this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,like cod but this one with no dedicated servers and bug fixes was a bit off a let down)-:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The worst Call of Duty game in the franchise. No innovation or creativity. Also, it has one of the worst endings I've ever seen in gaming."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,YOU CANT PLAY IT IF YOU TRY YOU GET RAM PROBLEM AND IF YOU FIX IT IT CRASHES
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same Sh!t. This should be called MW4. activision can go Fu*k them selves because they really Fu*ked up this time. This sh!t is worse than Black ops II
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't just, don't. For the love of all things on this planet, do not buy this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After about a month or two, the game because unplayable because of memory issues, even though I have top of the line hardware (i7, GTX780, and 8GB RAM). I've scoured the internet for fixes but haven't found any. This game was a disappointing waste of money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Titanfall is still better optimised for all kind of PCs, COD:GHOST is too overpowered even with the 4gb ram patch, i got this game right after it's released and i regret my decision of getting this game instead of Watch Dog with a better Fps in game and less lagging. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ AFTER 1 year: COD GHOST improved but still plain and laggy. Who ever it is behind all of this earned trust."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Campaign seemed to have the average inovation for CoD that will be completly forgotten the next year. I would rate it a 7/10 as CoD goes and maybe 3.5/10 when you compare it with the greats such as Skyrim and Half Life 2. Seemed like they were more focused on finding different ways to use different enviroments for their levels that they forgot to write the script till last minute. Emersion is a 0/10 due to this fact because the controls keep reacting differently andchanging based on what level you are playing. You can never seem to focus on what is going on when this happens.   The Multiplayer game-mode started out with a lot of hackers that slowly got weeded out (thank you VAC even if you blamed me for cheating in MW2) which improved the gameplay a bit but when compared to what I have seen from CS:GO nothing has quite stacked up aginst it. 3/10 for multiplayer stability, performace, server quality, and game mechanics.   Let's just skip over squads...   Though I have put nearly 100 hours into the Extinction game-mode it is very repetitive and has a fair amount of server lag that just doesn't work for me. When I purchased this game it was one of 5 games in my steam library and I was a CoD fanboy. This gamemode isn't really any fun when playing solo and if you have more than the first map then you still don't have more than the first map most of the time anyway because there is nobody else online that will play those maps. Overall I rate this mode a 5/10 for the general idea of it even if it isn't very well exocuted."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. Wish i could trade my current copy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Easily the worst in the series... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crash on leavle 7 cant finsh playing i have 8 ram i shood not have to tewkt my pc cod goast
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty ended with the end of the Modern Warfare series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, I wish i could actually hold an opinion on it...  Visually its very nice, 'if you have a beefy computer'  the story is an improvemnt on most cods yet gameplay it still tedious grunt killing with an array of similar weapons   my favorite part has to be when the game crashes towards the end of the campaign and you're never able to finish it, the games forums are full of people with this problem so Im not alone here... Come on, what are you waiting for? join us and stare at a blank screen after logging about 5 hours of gameplay..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(Note: Since posting, I've updated this review. See the lower paragraph.) This game is a worthless and unsupported pile of crap. Let me just say that I can run Black Ops II at maximum settings with absolutely no FPS dips or issues whatsoever. Ghosts, on the other hand, is a different story. Even on the lowest possible settings (where the game looks beyond awful, as if I had Vaseline smeared across my screen), I can barely keep it above 20 FPS, and sporadic dipping freqently pushes the FPS down into the single digits. Even tweaking the settings to the best you can for your system (which, even after being done, the game will probably still look terrible) is a nightmare. Every time you save a change in the graphics setting menu, even something as basic as switching between fullscreen and windowed mode, the game will have to reload the entire level. There is simply no excuse for such poor PC optimization. This game is an absolute insult to customers. Avoid at all costs. I bought this game on disc at BestBuy for $40, which is $20 less than the normal price as of now, and I paid about $39 too much. Do not waste your money on this.  UPDATE: (6/12/14)  I got around to playing this game again today, and I noticed that the framerate issues have been far improved (nowhere near perfect, but much, much, better). I don't know if there was an update of the game that I missed, or if the latest AMD graphics driver update fixed things, but whatever the case, the game runs a lot better than it did before. It's still not running as smooth as it should be, but it is much smoother than earlier, so at least now I can call it a playable PC game. I still wouldn't recommend paying the full price for it, but it might be worth picking up when/if it goes on super-sale."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Never agian am I going to buy another call of duty game.  Pros: Graphics Good for a 13 year old's first FPS  Cons: ::campaign was sub-par ::carppy mulitplayer ::match making is horrendous, took at least 10min to find a game till the host disconnects... ::they milked the hell out with all the DLC ::$60 price tag, it's never worth it for this serires anymore ::cludderd with underaged gamers and aim botters  $400 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars for the enitre COD seriers, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game alone is $60. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. if you had wasted your money on any of the DLC for these games I feel sorry for your wallet. This is the out come of compines trying to maximize profits and squeez the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of gamers by giving you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ expericane unless you buy and download all the DLC to be able to play the game as inented. Never agian am I purchasing a Call of Duty game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When I buy COD games it's mostly for the story. They're pretty good. This story was great yes but the online lacks. Giving it a negative review because most people are willing to buy just to play mindless hours of online. Get a better FPS online game to play, if you think this is the one that works you're probably wrong."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game stutters on my really nice gaming pc. It wont work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,had got this game and it still dose not work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,an ok game deffenatly not as good as the rest off the franchise
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is pretty bad. I played multiplayer for about 250hours. I would rate singleplayer 3/10 and the multiplayer 7/10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the absolute worst PC port of a game that I have ever seen!! I have an i7 processor, 16GB ram, and the Nvidia GTX 690 and i still cant play this game without frame drops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"horrible game, game was rushed and defenitly very bad quality, could I get a refund?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this game unless you have a REALLY high end PC. Performance of the game sucks so much and the game looks very very bad on normal graphic settings. System requirements and game performence are not anywhere near in line.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't get it. Trust me. Its a hacker zone. IW is showing no effort to combat hacking or giving dedicated servers as was promise for post-launch
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very dissapointed. The potential is there, but this game matching system stinks. It is very difficult at times to even get a game, especially if you want to play with other friends on line. Team up and you might wait for 20 minutes or more to find a game. If your alone it is not so bad.   This is also one of the worst games since maybe modern warfare 3, when it comes to hackers. Almost every night we find one in a game somewhere. It is sad that they have ruined the game. Even the X-Box friends of mine are not happy with the multiplayer part of the game. The only part of the game that is really decent is the single player.  Thoughts from an old guy......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game has potential, no doubt about that. But as others pointet out, performance is terrible. Seen multiple aimbotters in few hours of playing MP, i have played Black Ops II for like 400 hours and never seen an aimbotter. The spawnsystem, atleast in TDM and HC TDM is horrible, as it is in many other CoD's, but this one seems worse. The maps seems bigger than other CoD's, which is a plus in my book and the gameplay seems pretty alright too. I really like this game to be honest, but gets ruined by terrible spawns, aimbotters and poor performance. It's better than MW3, but still feels like a half finished game with a lot of fixes to be made. I'm sorry Infinty Ward, nice try, but can't recommend it considering the price. Thumbs up for adding bots though :) They seem well made."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"20k people playing speak for themselves. when you seek a good CoD, go buy mw2 or blackops 2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is rubish get bf4 much more fun!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,... to much cheating. Poor grafics. Much to expensive.  MP Maps normaly can not be played after some weeks.  Poor performance.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This, I have to say, is the worst game I have ever played. Glitchy, none of my weapons fire smoothly, and it seems that all the others guys are cheating as their weapons seem to fire fine. I am not a pro-gamer but I am not horrible either. One of my friends thought that the game would receive patches to make it run better, but so far no deal. It is too bad since I spent almost a hundred bucks on the game and the map pack."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably the worst single-player campaign out of any CoD game ever. It felt like it was written by an 8 year old.  Multiplayer is okay because there are some cool outdoorsy maps, but it seems like there are a lot of playlists and game types missing, for example standard kill confirmed, sabotage, etc. I have the feeling you can only get them by buying additional DLC packs. I'm not going to do this as overall the game was so disappointing I don't feel like giving IW any more money. Also most of the available gametypes are unplayable because there are so few people online, so I'm stuck playing domination or TDM.  Let me be clear. The franchise is pretty much dead to me after this game. That joy you had after beating the campaign for the first modern warfare game and playing a few multiplayer matches. That's gone. I bought this game for half off and I still want my money back."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i call play the game it say content package is no longer available
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game. It's a dreadful, DREADFUL, PC port. It runs like cancer. It looks like crap.  It's a shame as the weapon sounds are go and it plays okay, bur frankly Quake Like looks and runs better than this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Almost no players online. Only rated dedicated servers with admins, vote kick, map selection and a map editor could save the future of any (PC) Call of Duty game. Won't buy any CoD anymore. The series is dead on pc for sure."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not worth it at 60, but on the positive there were many improvements to the non-dlc weapon buying system. also: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DLC FOR DAYS! WHY????? every single CoD that's recent has this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are here for the campaign, then I would say yes it is a good game. But if you are like most other Call of Duty players, who only play for the multiplayer, I strongly suggest you DO NOT buy this game. The multiplayer is crappy and boring."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you want to -Play with cheaters -Play with campers -Die with 2 bullets in body -Play bad optimized game -Get mad before getting psychopath ... CoD(MP) series getting more annoying by the time. This is my last CoD purchase. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward. Go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself  -------------------------------------- My system specs: -i7 3660qm (whatever) -2x 650M GTX 1024MB -8GB RAM  Still playing with lags on very low.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you've read about all the performance issues and think that your PC might be good enough to have a decent experience, you are wrong. The PC that can run this does not exist. This is THE worst optimised game I have ever played. It is frankly appalling that they think they can charge money for it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Since I bought this game it has not started at all. I followed online instruction checked in many ways and many times, I still can not play it. and I found that its really hard to get any one to speak with. not satisfy with customer service as well. Paid such price for this game just waste my time and money. I was really interested in Call of Duty series. not now"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,in this game the SP will make you feel over powerd mother f*ckers but the multiplayer will make you feel Suckers its a total waste of money the story is fun but ultra short and the multiplayer is buggy as hell just another overratted cod game ...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Could have done better (same with the other ones) Nice graphics but do something new!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Get Black Ops 2 instead. PC version is a stinker. PS4 version is better though and that is not a lie.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game wont even freaking work on my computer waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Garbage. Save your money, this thing is so poorly optimized that it can't give me more than 25fps on a i7/16gb ram/radeon 6770 rig."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really Sucks how it is very Unoptimized
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's like no other Call of Duty! Call of Duty: Ghosts is entierely play to win. This franchise has fallen deep into the depths of Satan's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to somehow remain in business. The only possible way to keep this boat afloat is to release â™¥â™¥â™¥-loads of DLC and paying for weapons, squad points, even EXP to keep people who can't dig themselves out of the briney depths of Davey Jones's sphincter and purchase a game that is worth $60. The game is only multiplayer and everyone there now is somehow the highest rank possible. You only join games in progress where you fill in some poor, raging sod's spot against the enemy team who has set themselves up in strategic spawn-camp positions. I played 5 games recently and my average time alive was 3.8 seconds. AT ALL COSTS DO NOT BUY."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I usually dont write reviews but i had to for this one. I usually play CoD where it belongs on console but time around i wanted to try it on PC, this was the worst mistake ever. The game will not even run properly, and if by chance it does its super laggy. My campaign wont even play at all, and theres no multiplayer community ever online. Ive even tried to contact their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ support team to fix the issues and all they ever did was ask for my system specs do nothing about it, and ask for it again after they lost them. Do NOT buy this crap game use your money on better games.  0/10 Ive played F2P games better than this"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is crap   because 1st: lag     2snd: whenever i'm loading the 'federations day,' its always keep saying Call of duty ghost is not working.WHAT THE HELL!  I kept on but to low graphic and still none work.      3rd i coulnt coneect my damn multiplayer. MUTNY! I hope the advanced warfare will be 100% best just like BO2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing worst game I have ever played. Non-stop lag, no players, hackers on day 1, another shocking Call of Duty, the movement in the game litterally makes me feel sick, terribly optomised for the PC. DO NOT BUY AT ALL COSTS!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I didn't find this one very good. I guess If I had time for the multiplayer I'd get more out of it but I managed to fly through the single player and on my second run through got all the collectables even on a hard setting. it's a bit Meh for me this one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If u Want to play the singleplayer go ahead but if u are only interested in the multiplayer save your money. This game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on pc no mater how good your rig are
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not realy a great game grapic sucks realy hard
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many hacker kiddies
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth the money - another rip off
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game was ok. Other COD games were A LOT better. The campain was ok if you could even run the game at first. The Co-Op is really bad and there are already hackers. Extinction is ok tho. Over all rating 6/10 to be genorious.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All in all I just want my 60$ back this game is terrible, the community is terrible, the lag is terrible, the maps are terrible, the game just feels so...cheap...It feels like it should be a F2P game...but it isn't, I really wish I could get my money back  And whats more, a complete blantant lie with no dedicated server, and this crappy crappy matchmaking, the whole game is just terrible.  Please people, just dont buy it, just dont.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same ol same ol. While I'm use to playign on conole as far as CoD is concerned the pc platform of this game is a complete waste of time and money. Dont bother.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy this game!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty is the same thing over, and over, and OVER again. None of the small new features (Fish AI) were so small, they didn't impress me at all. Call of Duty really needs to try innovation."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sure, this game has really good graphics and all, but leaning more towards TF2, and any other FPS, I dont personaly dont recommend this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not loading ( Modern Warfare 3 &amp; Call of Duty Ghost ). error after each attempt to install.... Even though I followed supports directions... I have the speed, ram, and hard drive space of 1.5TB..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"- Horrible graphics - Terrible multiplayer maps - All guns basiclly oneshot everybody, just pick a random assault rifle and you don't have to unlock anything else anymore. - Aliens - No dedicated servers - No LAN  + I enjoyed the singleplayer... for 2 hours."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I feel this game may have been optimized for consoles as the optimization is not the best on PC. The graphics do look pretty good and the campaign and mulitplayer were fun but I feel it could have been optimized better. I know a friend who is getting 60 fps on his PS3 and my PC can barely manage 30 fps. As of now I feel Black Ops 2 is the better Call of Duty game out right now. Hopefully the optimzation for PC will be better in the future.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Joined a game and instantly killed by a hacker!!! 12/10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This gamer is terrible. Tryed making myself like it but it failed. I hade hope for a call of duty pc renaissance with black ops 2 but this killed any and all dreams of that, this is just awful."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont buy it, Hay day is better......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD to date. FPS Lag on high end systems, recycled graphics, riddled with hackers. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision, I'll never buy another COD. Don't waste your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"~3000 people online at 7 PM, ~1000 at noon, if you really want to play Ghosts buy it on console, on PC you can only play team deathmatch with the same people everytime. It isn't the best game from Call of Duty series, but it's still not the worst game imho. There are worse."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the worst game ever to come out on pc. the game runs really really bad it does not matter if your computer has over 3 bil cores with over 1 mil gb of ram with 1 mil r9 290x the game just wont run. Now if the game would run and the skipping,lagging, and the hackers I would be palying this game a lot more but I can't play with game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As with most of the COD franchise (Black Ops not withstanding) the game is long on graphics, short on plot, and basically begs you to forgive the crappy single player campaign with some worn out multiplayer tropes.   The single player campaign is a joke of the first order. It's only about five hours long and is basically a rehash of the plot of Moonraker complete with a space marine assault on the enemy space station. It's loaded with completely absurd apocalyptic set-pieces like holding a beach against overwhelming odds (then inexplicably abandoning your post because...hey! You're a Ghost!!!); scaling buildings as they explode around you, and using space-based weaponry to punish the bad guys. All the while dealing with your team mates who basically spout ridiculous jingoistic pseudo-military jargon that would make even Jerry Bruckheimer turn away in shame. Meh. Been there, done that.  The multiplayer is basically the same COD multiplayer everyone is used to. They've extended the sight lines on the maps, so camping snipers may enjoy it more than the traditional run-and-gun COD MP action, but by-in-large its the same old cafeteria fare one would expect. The big improvement: Squads mode, where your online avatars can battle other teams even if you're logged out to gain you XP and credits. Wooo. Nice idea, but fails a bit in practice since the bot AI is stupidly predictable.  In a nutshell: COD Ghosts is like getting a loaded baked potato at a chain restaurant: it seems like a good idea at the time, it looks good, but it has zero nutritional value and you'll have heartburn and regret for days afterward. If you must buy a COD title; get Black Ops II. Sure it's older, but it has a much better plot and equivalent graphical features."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was excited when I first heard of the new storyline that went along with Ghosts and I expected another solid title from Infinity Ward. However, this game is essentially broken and buggy. I did enjoy the story however, I also feel that it is one of the weakest in the series. In addition, multiplayer is probably the worst so far. Given the price tag, and the expectations that go along with the Call of Duty Series, I cannot recommend this game. Wait for a sale if you must play it, but then beware of potential game crashing bugs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy from steam. I have paid 50 dollars to buy this game and not only does it not work. I can't find out why it does not work. The game starts and the computer pops to my main screen and stays there. I can hear music of the game but cant see it on my screen. I have had a nightmare trying to figure out what is wrong with it and finally. I give up and just realize I wasted a bunch of money. Steam support is a joke and nearly impossible to navigate. You send an inquiry and nobody responds. If you want the game get an Xbox.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is trash don't waste your money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Boring story, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC port, bad graphics. First COD I regret buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty bad port to pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,multiplayer is a let down bag in game lag
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not recommended
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recently transitioned to PC gaming and I have to say this game is not worth $60. I have an FX 8350 @ 4.4GHz, 8GB of G-SKILL Sniper @ 1600MHz and 2 GTX 760s on SLI (not bragging, but I think it's a decent build) and this game runs like crap. I own Metro: Last Light, which is a very graphics intensive game, and I can play almost maxed out. COD: Ghosts? If I attempt to max out the graphics it will go to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I would rather recommend Battlefield 4 instead of this garbage. I should have read all the reviews before buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST CALL OF DUTY OF ALL TIME !!  First of all , I aint a BF fanboy but an experienced COD player who played it since 2005 on every titles it has on PC. Before this COD was released I didnt set my hope up too high , but didnt expect it to be bad either because Infinity ward never let the fans down before.  The Pros  -Singleplayer (Mediocore , yes but I got no choice but to fill this in)  -New Extinction mode (At least it's new)  -'Create a Soldier' function in multiplayer  The Cons  -Bad Optimization for PC   -6 GB of Ram , 66 GB of HDD spcaces are needed (For this garbage , seriously ?)  -Mouse lag in Menu page.  -Outdated graphic which share the similarity to a game from 2009 - 2010 (Made me wanna know where did that 66 GB go? because the texture sucks ball )   -Bad Voice acting both in singleplayer and multiplayer. Hear some stuff from the Multiplayer Announcers and you will know that I meant.  -No more Ping indicator !!! , in FPS (multiplayer) gaming ,We need to know / aware of our ping all the time , Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did you remove it ??  -Sound system sucks , every ... EVERY guns sound like a low grade firecracker, like those low budget games. Maybe on par to Black ops 1.  -Worst map design ever , there is no fun !! , This is a downfall of IW in map developing.  -Instant crash (Blue screen , Black screen , Green artifects) in multiplayer for many user (me too w/ green artifects) espacially those with 'Nvidia' graphic card  -Boring Killstreak rewards , many of them are â€˜stupidâ€™  Call of duty : RUBBISH  4.5 / 10  *Another reminder , Go read my other recommendations on COD I always gave it a nice score, Iâ€™m a fans but this one is an absolute trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"unfortunately this game could have been alot better in my opinion. They have moved from 12 man teams to 6 man teams which I believe is them attempting to go towards an esport route rather than competing against bf4. Understanding the loadout system took a while to learn as well as it is not user friendly, the grenades and tatical items will also take some getting used to as they do not conform to realism i.e. motion detector which you start with does not show them on your mini map but instead will explode like a mine and then allow you to see them through walls for a brief period of time. Killstreaks have also changed in this game some for the better and some for the worse but this will be more of a personal opinion. Game requirements have recently been lowered so that is a major improvement. Maps while it was said they were larger in reality they are still the size best suited for run and gun playstyle than sniper nests and the enviroment is more suited for constant movement rather than 'camping' an area or section of the map. However on the other hand the maps have several layers to them 2-3 most of the time so they have more depth and passageways to areas so creating a choke point is much more difficult. In this respect the maps could be considered larger.  Overall this game feels like more of an updated version of counter-strike where you have a small team to complete your objective. The responsiveness of the game is still very good but suffers from the lack of a server it still uses the p2p system."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Glitchy as hell, even with the patch. Stuttering and freezes in both single and multi play. Wait for the patch that fixes this issue before you buy. You have been warned. PS to Infinity Ward.....Shame on you.....Shame on you twice.....shame on you three times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just looks like they pretty much gave it a face lift and that was it at least for the multiplayer imo. Wish I would have waited till it was on sale instead of paying $60. Rinse and repeat is the mantra currently with the COD series. At least with bo2 they tried to push the envelope a little. Even with the settings cranked up the game still looks mediocre compared to newer titles like ac4 and bf4.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Players Online: 83
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WHERES MY REFUND 16 gigs of ram BUllONY!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Campaign is the only one worth my money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC GAMERS UNITE AND BYCOOT THE FRANCISE THIS WILL BE THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WILL EVER GET A CHANGE!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER BUY ANOTHER C.O.D GAME AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ every year
Call of Duty: Ghosts,' PURE GARBAGE '  Money wasted.  Never Again. Lesson Learned.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The idea of having to buy character upgrades is bad enough but asking hundreds of dollars is just plan stupid...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So many bugs it's unplayable. If you change any of the default video settings it stutters, If you have 2 monitors and turn one off then play the game, it stutters. Steam needs a refund process for games like this. It's a bad console port. The controls are crap too. To slide you press forward, sprint, and crouch. How do you press w, shift, then control with one hand? pressing shift and control with one finger doesn't work. Please save your money and don't waste your time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The last call of duty your ever buy because after this one your never play it again. I was a call of duty fanboy befor this game i pre orderd this one every day at school i couldnt wait to get home to play cod but after this one i could never play a nother call of duty with out thinking was big steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i was sold being told its a game any other call of duty befor ghost I would play every day for hours but after this one its killed it for me The only thing i have left are the fond memorys of cod 1 cod uf and cod 2 and cod 4/5 that it activiosion killed call of duty for me never gonna buy a nother call of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too much cheaters in PC version.. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst 70$ ive EVER spent.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor performance, Multiplayer noob friendly, maps too big for the standards of COD. I really don't like this game. If you want â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, buy this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very poor console port. Don't buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,65 FOV. Do I need to say more?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not entirely finished game, graphics are terrible and the spawnpoints in multiplayer are even worse than in modern warfare 3! On the other hand there are some nice new features like the tactical knee slide or the contextual lean which makes this game more realistic as its previous call of duty products. All in all an 'ok' game but not worth the money!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD ghosts......... what a shame, seriously, I used to be a fan of COD since the franchise started, I liked all of the titles, even the ill fated MW3. I used to think that every game, in any successful franchise, should have a different 'taste': Will it be a new story line, a novel character customisation scheme, a somewhat different gameplay, or even the addition of a DOG (e)........ until I bought GHOSTS. it had all of that, but im in a very VERY depressingly bad way (graphics suck, really, guns are, with some exceptions, boring to death and the storyline in SP is one o the worst offline experienses i ever had) if you are planning to break up with your GF/BF before christmase, buy them GHOSTS......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player version is very short when compared to previous versions. Multiplayer is a hackers paradise. This game is maybe worth $20 for the single player and a the 10% chance that you get in a multiplayer game with no hackers but anything beyond that is a waste.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is quick and easy on all but the hardest level. Lots of lag during the intro videos and I have a high end machine... Multi-player is awful, already full of cheats and hacks. most types of maps cannot be played because there are simply not enough players in the lobbys to start games. Too bad, some of the upgrades over previous COD games look good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too much stuttering...lagging and bad servers...waste of money...story mode kind of boring...finish it for 2 days only...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Rubbish. Only for kiddies or nabs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this laggy game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game itself is ok, but for PC it SUCKS. Pros: +Good graphics +Interesting maps (but many are too large) +Unlock system is good +Extinction, Squads Cons: ----HACKERS. I've seen aimbots many times -Not optimised: From 91 FPS to 20-25 when something explodes/smoke. -Lag/No ping bars -Few killstreaks. -Some maps are just too big.  Overall, the game is OK, but on PC, with the optimisation, hackers and lag, just no. Multiplayer:6.5/10, but with the problems 4/10. Campaign was okay, could be worse, far from the MW series 6/10. Extinction is so fun, much fast pace, such interesting, wow 8/10. Overall, don't buy it if it's 40$+."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too many bugs and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, dont buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Big shame according to the big COD games the games does not remind me of any other COD game :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the only spoiler i'm gonna put in here is that the ghosts campaign follows a dreaded 'what if' scenario, which has more holes in it than swiss cheese. the game is just repetetive. if you haven't got black ops 2 yet, skip this and go for black ops 2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too jittery, screen freezes in online combat every single time an enemy is encountered at close quarters, once it unfresses, youre dead. I expected much more than this from Infinity Ward, but cant say Im surprised with their publisher being Activision- they have a long history of forcing release of games before theyre ready and releasing multiple bug fixes and patches later. Its more frustrating than anything to just turn the game on at all, hoping to have a fun time and end up angry instead. Worthless and cant even be called 'entertainment' as far as I see it. I have a mid range machine (8 core i7, 2 GB dual video cards and 8 GB DDR3 Ram) as far as this game requirements are concerned, but its no slouch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"didnt live up to expectations on pc,been getting a little better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just dont buy it. Its hardly playable because its badly ported to the pc. Those frame rate drops tho
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multiplayer maps too small, only good for box fight style gaming."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hope they come up w/ an update that fixes all this crap. i should have just bought a premium membership for my bf4 than buying this. they should have sticked with treyarch.graphics look like the cod 3 yrs ago.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game before 1st patch, but lag compensation ruins it all since then... It was already there on MW3 but still was ok, now, on ghost, it's just unplayable, unless you have a slow connection."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game sucks now!! Cod Ghost ending in campaign is worst! That's the spoil that I tell you! Multiplayer is so worst then Black ops 2!! Before, I don't this game is going to be fantastic, but now I find out is nothing!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A total garbage. Wasted money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sixty dolloars to keep playing the same maps over and over. Plus the level scheme has no curve what-so-ever because you are granted access to every gun and attachment right off the bat. OH but you COULD play HUNDREDS of hours to get the elite perks. They make a little bit of difference. So yeah. Oh and campaign is cheesy as crap again no surprise there but hey there's always the long-term playing and dynamic multiplayer =D (Sarcasm is your friend).
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth the money - another rip off
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Full of Bugs,Hackers,no dedicated serves,no support, its a GranD Game FAIL!!!  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,such a waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"maps to large, the game is to laggy ,just a poor multiplayer game. if they don't fix this game this will be my last cod game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Id rather play something else I wasted over a hundred â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥en dollars
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only thing good about this game is the promo video's.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All in all I just want my 60$ back this game is terrible, the community is terrible, the lag is terrible, the maps are terrible, the game just feels so...cheap...It feels like it should be a F2P game...but it isn't, I really wish I could get my money back  And whats more, a complete blantant lie with no dedicated server, and this crappy crappy matchmaking, the whole game is just terrible.  Please people, just dont buy it, just dont.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's Call of Duty if you played one of them you've played them all. Essentially you purchase a remix of the same material from the older games tweaked and slap together with !!!Brand New Bugs!!! 8D .   The game is poor quality and shows in everything from the design to the graphics and lag from p2p instead of dedi servers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Seriously.  No...Fu*cking seriously!   The game is pretty, I'll give it that. But holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ talking crab cakes is it hard to get kill streaks. Flanked from every damn direction, spawns are totaly and complete garbage. I seriously spawned right smack dab in the middle of the enemy  base...What??    Lag? So much lag its stupid. We figured that with the horrble lag comp they have provided, its better to be downloading 30 porn vids at the same time. Match making is the worst thing I have ever seen. Why are hackers with max pres being paired with dudes who bought the game an hour earlier? Come on.   Camping? Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balls is there ever a dump truck full of corner queers. The only people int he game that are being killed are the guys and als that ACTUALLY play the game. COD has become a game of little skill, its become a waste of time and a waste of money. Make a game pretty with lots of little perks and the god damn sheep will follow.   Enjoy your new boats ya bunch of filthy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   Fu*k this game and FA FA FA FUUUUUUUUCK COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Singelplayer is pretty awesome... Maps in MP are boring and makes the game pretty much boring.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So after spenind 35+ hours on Ghosts (8 hours on campaign and 38 on Multiplayer), I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from buying this game. Campaign was nice, but had the same cliche events as the past few games where the bad guy somehow lives and does something to the player. When it comes to the multiplayer, it's an absolute joke. Hackers, spawning points that will make you want to bash your screen out in frustration, the normal CoD community full of little kids ranting and raving and many more. One upside is extinction which is rather fun to play with friends.   When it comes to how the game runs, if you don't have a reasonably high end PC you might struggle. When I tried running this on my mid-end gaming pc, it could barely play it even on the lowest settings, however on my high-end PC which was just built, it runs at the FPS cap with all settings at their highest.  Summary:  Pros: - Extinction mode is fun  - Campaign has a good-ish story line  Cons: - Horrible optimization for PC, basically a console copy &amp; paste  - Lack of dedicated servers  - Horrible gameplay unless you have a high-end PC  - Horrible support  - Horrible community as always.  Basically, don't waste your money on this game. Rather go and buy Battlefield 4 or some other FPS."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,badly optimised port....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,most unprofession â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ive ever seen in my life.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Compared to other COD games this is very poor, if they keep this up everyone will go elsewere COD 2 &amp; 3 were far superior to this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,cant get along with this game im really bad at it and im not getting any better any time soon! seems very stuttery but the campaign is good. i am enjoying battlefield 4 alot more. on cod the maps are too big for how few people play in the matches and even though i am really bad at it you seem to die quicker than other cod games. does have alot of potential to be a great game but i just cant force myself to enjoy it anymore because i paid money for it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single most worst game i have bought on steam. Id recommend this game to nobody , activsion and infinity ward are scum ,period. Hopefully company's like this will die out and put an end to people being fleeced like this. Here's hopping for a refund..   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's ok but all the hacking takes all the FUN out of it. :-(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After spending some hours (with some I mean quite a bunch), I've came up with this conclusion: - no love from Activision and it's clear from the very beginning - you cant choose a map nor a server: you will end up in the worst ping-wise and with your most hated map - perks... Yeah, let's give you the 'official Wall Hack' so you cant discern anymore who cheats from who does not - lag lag lag and then lag, but not the lag you suffer for your poor connection, but the HARDWARE LAG. This game is capable of knock down your hypersuperextra pc - have you ever tried to scope with the thermical feature of your beloved rifle? FORGET IT, it will freeze, making the shoot impossible /golfclap "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Play CS, it's better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Doesnt load, haven't been able to play a single minute. Dont buy....."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Graphics 4/10 Ugly Gameplay 4/10 Not much to do Weapons 3/10 Look weird Connection 3/10 Laggy Game is bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,But it has dogs and interactive fish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My god.. This is one of the WORST pc ports I have SEEN. Frame rate is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! This game runs silky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing smooth on the consoles, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the PC. Don't waste your time. Buy it for console. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this port of a game.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No lets see here eh.... Texture quality in campaign: 0/10 cant see any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ see only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing matrix blue and white on the VERY FIRST MISSION Guns: 10/10 Beautiful see only in the first mission at space :v Should you buy it: -100/10 if they arent gonna fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing then so long COD :V I hope this help you guys a lot who is poor and save money to buy GOOD and PLAYABLE game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After two playthroughs (separated by over a year), this game still suffers from horrible PC performance issues (i.e. extremely poor optimization). Granted Crunch's computer hardware is a bit dated, however even with the graphic settings as low as they can go, framerates would range from over 100fps to under 10fps in very short order. He experienced lag during supposed decent framerate periods and astonishingly mission load cut scenes. WTF?! And everytime he adjusted the graphics settings (in a frustrating and almost futile attempt to get a decent, reliable framerate) the game has to replay the mission cut scene with no option to skip. It appears little effort was put into making a decent PC port or into quality control. Crunch experienced nothing but aggravation trying to play this game (one of the few games that consistent frustrated him to the point of wanting to put his fist through something).  Even IF the story was extremely compelling and well-crafted (and there are plot-holes almost from the very start), Crunch cannot recommend this game on the continuing (and likely never to be fixed) performance issues. Crunch gives it a 4.0/10 and that is being generous.  NB Because of such poor game performance and no resolution from the developer/publisher, Crunch will NOT be purchasing or playing CoD games anymore. So, he has uninstalled all his CoD. If Activision either resolves gameplay issues or drastically improves the quality of published games on day 1, Crunch might change his mind. MIGHT! He will also be cautious about buying games from the same companies."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,why after i buy the game would i waste money buying stuff that should be in the game in the first place? more loadouts 'why' another map pack yes. considering what it costs to buy i think overall its not worth the money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player unplayable... Try to make it through the campaign, if it's not crashing, it's lagging with such cruddyperformance, it's hardly even playable. And that is with a very new, very powerful, computer trying to figure out what the hell this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ load is that I've downloaded onto it...  Multiplayer unplayable... Just forget trying to connect to any server for any extended period of time, along with a miriad of other issues, along with those you find in single player. CoD Ghosts laughs at your feeble attempts to uninstall and reinstall the gross collection of gigabytes that is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pot, and despite any form of attempts to fix, related to firewalls, internet, drives, or whatever you may conjure as a justification for this breaking, this program (It does not deserve the title of game) will disappoint you so thoroughly, you will pray to Gaben, pray to RNJesus, pray to whatever gaming god you may have... but you will remain alone, with a lighter wallet and a heavier soul...  There is nothing that justifies this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It does not matter what content it has, with this many wide spread issues across so many cases of attempting to use this program, it's simply ... just wow... I'm done, I can't even rant anymore here, okay yeah. Bye. I'm going to go play Minesweeper, it's superior to this ... whatever...  0/10 unplayable"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty game ever. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is just waste of my money. i get all this stuff for CoD: Ghosts (season pass too) and no players online. so i cant recommend this game for anyone.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghost is a giant rippoff, just like Call of Duty Black Ops II. I buy the games for the Single Player Content. I should have learned my lesson after Black Ops II. The Ghost levels are too few and soo simple. I think what they're really doing is trying to draw me into multiplayer online play, because that's where they want to make their money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DON'T BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !! DON'T SPENT YOUR MONEY FOR NOTHING! DON'T BUY THIS CRAP! DON'T GIVE A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ABOUT THIS !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad storyline, bad multiplayer. Simply not a fun game to play "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I very much liked BO2, I still play it, and I was expecting that a newer COD would make it even more great...sadly this is far from it. It's actually the opposite of evolution in therms of fun and Online mathcmaking. Let me be clear, it's not the fact that I get shot almost every 3 seconds ( I expected this to happen in a new game) but the game just feels sloppy, made in such a rush, no care was given to any aspect of the playstyle, game logic, etc. Did I metnion the problems with performance? ... There are no performance problems ('sarcastic'), I just figured that the developers released the game with a simple copy/paste action of a 360 DVD to the computer... I tryied it once too, it works ... 'sigh'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,singleplayer in common is dissapointing
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy this crap its not optmized for the computer..... Try it at consoles may be better there
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is terrible. It looks like a game from 2006, it is poorly optimized so runs terrible and the multiplayer is a load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's been a month and I'm still getting servers unavaible message. The campaign was meh but the multiplayer is why we buy this and it doesn't work for me therefore I can't recommend it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If only there were dedicated servers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm very disapointed by this game. I've played every call of duty since probably its beginning and nothing changed since Modern Warfare 2. It looks okay, but it's simply boring and old. Sure there are few nice new tricks, but game seems outdated. Performance was poor for me when BF4 runs nicely."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pre-ordered this game.... but why. This game is just a money wast, the game laggs on my beast pc. I also spoke to a couple other playes and the game laggs as well by them. So dont wast your time and money to play this game beacause its just a scam......!  Blackshadow"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"B.u.ll.sh.it game. The worst MP ever. Lots of campers and also hackers.  - Buy a DLC pack , for no use . - People start leaving when AW came out  - Magically you will get stab by 12 year old knife ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better give the money to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.It will offer you more fap time than this cod will offer you gameplay
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor job by Activision. The Multiplayer is laggy plus full of bugs. Would not recommend this game to anyone! Think Activision should leave it to Treyarch, when it comes to making 10/10 games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dry story, multiplayer is dead"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same formula ripped off from previous Call of Duty games.  I hate the feature that u need to frag people in order to use ur killstreaks. Its painfull.  Not worth paying for.   This game should be free.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the weakest shooters I have ever played, If I could get my money back I would."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Give this game to someone who you hate so the trailer gets them excited for a terrible game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its just like all the other cods its blow the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of everyone and kill the leader i dont think much of multiplayer same as the rest plus hows idea was it to put aleins in it i though zombies was alot better i think activision has run out of ideas and just keep on repeating on it self
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts I'm afraid is given the unfortunate position of being the game after Call of Duty Black Ops II and before Call of Duty Advanced Warfare that Activision had to release half baked to temporarily satisfy the annual craving. It offers very little improvements over Call of Duty Black Ops II and resembles more of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. The only significant new features was the 'Create a Soldier' and perk points feature in multiplayer. Otherwise it is the same copy and paste game as previous Call of Dutys. At this point I am unable to recommend this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign storyline was a brilliant concept, it had really intensive and epic moments it was well worth the play. However, there are major stability issues, the game has lots of screen tearing, FPS drops, and major clunky moments. I would give this game a 6/10 final score. 4 points were subtracted for loads of stability issues, I would of subtracted more, but the storyline deserved something."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Black Ops 2 is much bettler than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ MW3 copy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is okay, but the rest REALLY SUCKS MW3 and BF2 was much better.....  Dont buy it wast of money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very poor console port. Don't buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,65 FOV. Do I need to say more?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game would be awesome but it is swarmed by Hundreds wallhackers and aimboters..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would like to give a nice review and have plenty of hour on this game to tell you it pros and cons. I would like to feel like the 60$ I paid for this game to worth it. I like the CoD series, don't take me wrong. I had a lot of fun playing the same game for the last 6 years with reworked textures and 'new weapons'. But now, I can't even tell you if it worth a penny cuz I can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play it! Keep random freezing for no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing reason and don't count on them to make a patch for ATI cards, instead go buy a nvidia you know, because 60$ on this crap is not enough money. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ activision. Not worth your money and certainly not your time. At least if they could fix their bugs... No keep making re-textured map of your last game, so much better. I've always wanted to play throughout all the game in the SP mode but nope... THREE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing step is all I can do where I am now... Please don't buy it, it really need to stop... There is plenty of FPS with a better support system that cost less and gives you more (Like Counter-Strike!)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game needs alot of improvements way TO MANY HACKERS.Get Dedicated Servers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game actually sucks, everytime i play there is lag, then when i try to exit the game crashes and i spend 5 minutes just trying to close it. The guns are horribly out of balance, and the maps are attrocious. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terribly laggy. Would be a great game if they updated it and didn't launch unfinished.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst 70$ ive EVER spent.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor performance, Multiplayer noob friendly, maps too big for the standards of COD. I really don't like this game. If you want â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, buy this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terribly unoptimised. Those others who have left negative comments about this game, however abhorent, are mostly correct."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,only lag i get is when i pull a scope if it wasnt for the hackers and we dedicated servsers again it might be worth looking into next but this one is hack invested and sucks mainly for that reason. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy this game. It is horrible. Better off playing Black Ops 2.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player version is very short when compared to previous versions. Multiplayer is a hackers paradise. This game is maybe worth $20 for the single player and a the 10% chance that you get in a multiplayer game with no hackers but anything beyond that is a waste.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is quick and easy on all but the hardest level. Lots of lag during the intro videos and I have a high end machine... Multi-player is awful, already full of cheats and hacks. most types of maps cannot be played because there are simply not enough players in the lobbys to start games. Too bad, some of the upgrades over previous COD games look good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the biggest disappointment ever in the whole CoD series. Stuttering, locking, massive lag, inconsistent mp game experience, no anti-hack whatsoever and not a single party in the production chain seems to feel responsible for this totally overrated epic failure. Dont buy, if you receive it as a gift, burn it and never speak to the giver again."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the all time worst pos string of code I've ever had the misfortune of wasting $100+ on. At 1st it crashed constantly, then they updated it and the only servers I can connect to are domination and team deathmatch games. I'm running a pc well over specs needed and have no issue with any other new games. I have every COD game since the franchise started and this will be the last!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Big let down. Video graphics is nice but the gameplay... Come on guys! If you wanted to release a title with the hype that you guys made it out to be then release it without the bloody bugs. I might as well have just flushed my money down the toilet. Don't release a game where I (as well as the rest of the PC community) have to deal with so much bugs. Don't get me wrong, the story in the game is pretty good and yes it keeps you in the game but like all recent CoD titles, it's short and straight to the point (feels like you're just grinding). I just felt let down with this game (And I have been a CoD player for 10 - 11 years). The games are just not as fun as the old WWII editions. But anyways the graphics are nice (But buggy) The new player interface is good (Not the best or original) And bring back the Zombies!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is full of hackers online
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs so bad that I can't even blame it for being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yet, it's simply unplayable and haven't even been patched yet. Infinity ward are console lovers and you should wait for the next trearch game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i found my sound is bad quality and there is no way of changing it also the graphics go prety bad on optomised so have to do manual setting enjoy playing when going well not often ???
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its broken on pc pls fix
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You have two choices for this game:  1. Stone(camper)haven 2. Hacked lobbies.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game sucks... waste of time and money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will never again buy another COD. I've loved these games but the lack of support for PC gamin is ridiculous. Hackers, poor fps are just the tip of the iceberg. Infinity Ward, you've let me down for the last time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excellent Graphics in campaign mode, good ideas for the multi-player maps, and a point system which finally makes more sense than it's predecessors, is all let done by major lag in the multi-player mode making it virtually unplayable online. Even when you follow the recommended instructions, dumb your graphics down and open all the recommended ports, still ridiculously slow. It would be nice to be able to select ping rates as with Black Ops II but no. Overall I have been left sorely disappointed with all but the campaign mode and this is not why I bought the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst CoD ever made. Not worth the money .... not even 10 bucks. It sucks so hard lags, hard FPS drops and again â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lobby system  The guys who made this have ever played MW1 with dedecatet servers?! i think not so if you make a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game the community can fix it but with this console copy not!!!  DONT BUY IT!!! Dont even think about it!!!! Get Battlefield 4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Save your money and buy BF4 or something. This game is full of hackers which they do nothing about and it's poorly optimized for the PC. I wish I could say Activision had learnt a few lessons from the issues encountered with MW2 and 3 but alas they couldn't really care less about the PC community and it shows.  Early 2014 and Titan Fall cannot come soon enough!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crash... Crash... Crash...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Go suck a ballsack, thank you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Direct3DDevice::Present failed (DEVICE REMOVED) : DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG (-2005270523)  You'll see that until you quit playing this stupid game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Steam says I have played this a total of 33 minutes, but that's not correct. You see, it has crashed every time I've started it - never played a single mission. Support from the developer is nonexistant. No more steam or activision stuff for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game itself is good, but on pc , the only games you can easily get into are deathmatch and domination REGULAR mode. which does get boring fast. if there were more people on the other game modes it would be a thumbs up from me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible PC Port, horrible framerate stuttering and freezes. Also a pretty bad COD game in general. Maps are too big and encourage camping, killstreaks are boring. Story is also quite predictable and Extinction mode just makes you wish you were playing Black Ops Zombies. In conclusion I don't recommend it. 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After installing 40 GB of garbage, I soon realize that my computer is crying after 40 GB have literally been wasted, I could've spent my $60 on 'books' on 'How to get a better social life' or I could've bribed the crap out of my family saying I am spending my free time on 'education' and 'college'. But no, the series MUST continue and the Call of Doodie fanboys and fangirls must continue to feed the developers money on $15 DLC for 4 maps. This game (and series for that matter) is the reason Ebola is an epidemic. I facepalmed so hard after playing this -- I rearanged the cells and molecules in my brain and finally passed a Math test in my class."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The singleplayer story is bad and lacks behind the one of the other CoD games.  The multiplayer is just like every other CoD multiplayer.  Oh yeaha and the dog feature is a joke and only relevant in the very beginning of the game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was lucky, I got this on a black friday sale... for anything more than 12 euros, it's ripping you off. It's more linear than a ruler. I was playing poorly and managed to limp-noodle through it in less than 7 hours... There are several missions that's completely monkey, you've no idea what you're needing to do and the first 10 times you just die for no good reason.. The AI of your fellow monkeys is even worse, atleast you have friendly fire, making it sliiiiiiiightly more realistic. Then again, realism has never been a part of any Call of Duty game, this is Holywood action on steroids, good looking if you've got a half decent pc and a story that has so many clichÃ©s in it that the aforementioned comment regarding Hollywood don't do it half justice.  That was story mode.. Now, multiplayer is full of seriously skilled nibs that'll tear you a new one before you ever knew you had one, not really my kind of thing. Realism is again out the window, but that's once again never been a part of CoD multiplayer either. So, for me, this game was below average, for anyone aiming for loads of MultiPlayer hours, great.. go for it, you get a super cheesy action fest to humor you for a few hours.. Once again, there are other MP games out there that does a better job at anything this game do.. But this ain't about those games..   So, everything summed up for me, a single player FPS sort of guy, on a 1 to 100, this is a mediocre 40, not rubbish, just a sigh in the long lines of CoD games... This is turning into another NHL, FIFA, NBA, NFL series... Hi, welcome to CoD 2014, good looking entertainment for a few hours with zero replay value..   Have a nice one!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Play CS, it's better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good Campaing but Short ========&gt;&gt; 7/10 Bad MultiPlayer, Bad Maps, Players Cheating Every Single Match (Like P2W Games), Bad Prestige ========&gt;&gt; 4/10 OverAll ========&gt;&gt; 5.5/10 Not Worth It ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crashed when I tried changing the resolution
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst game I've ever played in my life, just dont buy it!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pile of dirt!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing poor optimization is this?   I can play higher req games on high or ultra settings, but i can't play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on low settings! CoD always sucks, older CoD games too."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT GET THIS GAME JUST DONT DO IT TRUST ME Worst COD of all time barely anyone plays and its very poorly optimized. Dont.Buy.This.Game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fish AI, Dogs in your squad, Copy and Pasted Scenes From Previous Games?  What More Could You Possibly Ask For?  You won't ask for it, but what you will get is extreme regret for buying this piece of trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My god.. This is one of the WORST pc ports I have SEEN. Frame rate is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! This game runs silky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing smooth on the consoles, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the PC. Don't waste your time. Buy it for console. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this port of a game.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No lets see here eh.... Texture quality in campaign: 0/10 cant see any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ see only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing matrix blue and white on the VERY FIRST MISSION Guns: 10/10 Beautiful see only in the first mission at space :v Should you buy it: -100/10 if they arent gonna fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing then so long COD :V I hope this help you guys a lot who is poor and save money to buy GOOD and PLAYABLE game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. Wish i could trade my current copy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crash on leavle 7 cant finsh playing i have 8 ram i shood not have to tewkt my pc cod goast
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty ended with the end of the Modern Warfare series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, I wish i could actually hold an opinion on it...  Visually its very nice, 'if you have a beefy computer'  the story is an improvemnt on most cods yet gameplay it still tedious grunt killing with an array of similar weapons   my favorite part has to be when the game crashes towards the end of the campaign and you're never able to finish it, the games forums are full of people with this problem so Im not alone here... Come on, what are you waiting for? join us and stare at a blank screen after logging about 5 hours of gameplay..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(Note: Since posting, I've updated this review. See the lower paragraph.) This game is a worthless and unsupported pile of crap. Let me just say that I can run Black Ops II at maximum settings with absolutely no FPS dips or issues whatsoever. Ghosts, on the other hand, is a different story. Even on the lowest possible settings (where the game looks beyond awful, as if I had Vaseline smeared across my screen), I can barely keep it above 20 FPS, and sporadic dipping freqently pushes the FPS down into the single digits. Even tweaking the settings to the best you can for your system (which, even after being done, the game will probably still look terrible) is a nightmare. Every time you save a change in the graphics setting menu, even something as basic as switching between fullscreen and windowed mode, the game will have to reload the entire level. There is simply no excuse for such poor PC optimization. This game is an absolute insult to customers. Avoid at all costs. I bought this game on disc at BestBuy for $40, which is $20 less than the normal price as of now, and I paid about $39 too much. Do not waste your money on this.  UPDATE: (6/12/14)  I got around to playing this game again today, and I noticed that the framerate issues have been far improved (nowhere near perfect, but much, much, better). I don't know if there was an update of the game that I missed, or if the latest AMD graphics driver update fixed things, but whatever the case, the game runs a lot better than it did before. It's still not running as smooth as it should be, but it is much smoother than earlier, so at least now I can call it a playable PC game. I still wouldn't recommend paying the full price for it, but it might be worth picking up when/if it goes on super-sale."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Never agian am I going to buy another call of duty game.  Pros: Graphics Good for a 13 year old's first FPS  Cons: ::campaign was sub-par ::carppy mulitplayer ::match making is horrendous, took at least 10min to find a game till the host disconnects... ::they milked the hell out with all the DLC ::$60 price tag, it's never worth it for this serires anymore ::cludderd with underaged gamers and aim botters  $400 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars for the enitre COD seriers, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game alone is $60. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. if you had wasted your money on any of the DLC for these games I feel sorry for your wallet. This is the out come of compines trying to maximize profits and squeez the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of gamers by giving you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ expericane unless you buy and download all the DLC to be able to play the game as inented. Never agian am I purchasing a Call of Duty game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When I buy COD games it's mostly for the story. They're pretty good. This story was great yes but the online lacks. Giving it a negative review because most people are willing to buy just to play mindless hours of online. Get a better FPS online game to play, if you think this is the one that works you're probably wrong."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst call of duty game ever. Hell i spent $600 to get a better graphics card just so i can play this game, not knowing that this game is the worst game i've ever played. This is worse than hello kitty.  God damn it, bring back treyarch!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Easily the worst in the series... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game stutters on my really nice gaming pc. It wont work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Your servers are as laggy as i've never seen before. Game crashes more often than it should. Hosts tend to time out at least once a day. I bet i'm not the first one to say this game is in my bottom list. Goodbye
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The very worst game ever, do not waste money on this game. They just making games for cash grab now."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am more of a COD fan dating back to the originals, and an even bigger fan for the first two Modern Warfares. This game was disappointing to me. Storyline was okay, but was not a fan of multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst cod i've played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,#NAME?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if u want to waste your money buy this game.  Story = good for 10years old kids. APPcrash = 98% (multiplayer) Players = maybe 2000 online LAG = 100%  not worth for 1$. DONT BUY IT ;)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game has horable graphics but story is not that bad .A god dam potato can run this game but it wont start without 6 GB of RAM .I really like song called survival by Eminem which they used in game .I think that game is waste of many just go and have a great dinner for this money .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I find dis game very offensive, very useless money i spent, 5 hours of my life i could never take back, so bad even pacman is better, a 240p potato has better quality than this, so laggy, just a PURE WASTE OF MONEY. '0/10' - IGN 2012"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lag,crash,horrible graphics,low fps...... You can only play TDM otherwise no one plays this game anymore. Not reccomended at all"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign was actually not too bad, but still the worst out of any of the Call of Duty games"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad tech support who don't answer back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crashes frequently. Can't get past The Hunted Level even though I have everything updated and greatly meet the minimum specs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too short campain
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not recommended...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If I would know that game won't let me chante language I would never buy it! I am Polish, I understand Polish language I just hate how pathetic level of translation is! I hate to play games in Polish and the fact it's language-bound is making me hate steam!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game, and the series for that matter, is chock full of the most whiny folks I've ever gamed with. You kill a player a couple of times and they start yelling cheater. I'm a fairly mediocre player and I've been the victim of it more times than I can count. The whiners report you and to my surprise it actually has effect with Infinity Ward. If you are banned you have no recourse and you lose your online playablility, permanently. Infinity Ward says they thoroughly investigate the claims but I'm here to tell you it's not true. So if you want to gamble your investment in time and money on today's mood of an employee at IW by all means buy the game. Too bad because its one of the best fps games playability-wise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i have been a cod fan for about 10 years since no1 in 2003. i have to say, ghosts has been somewhat of a dissappointment for me, at least as far as PC is concerned. consistent screen hangs, 40gb of space despite mediorcre graphics, and the bland multiplayer makes this one of the low points in the franchise. granted the campaign is a blast, but after the exellent bops2 campagin with choices and alternate endings, ghosts campaign feels quite linear and holds your hand through out. I feel that infinity ward should take a leaf out of treyarchs book in terms of the campaign. extinction and squads are OK innovations to the series but feel like sidenotes to the 2 main components. a dissappointment, will best describe ghosts for me. :( sorry infinity ward. you really dropped the ball with ghosts. 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The positive aspects of call of duty ghosts are:  - better hit detection tham others cods - caracter customization - class setup - good weapon balance   The negative aspects of call of duty ghosts are:  - no theater mode - IED is anoying and ruined the game - Dog is op for a 5 killstreak reward, they nerf it but just after 9 months after the game realesed - maps are big and full of camping spots that ruined the game - fied order is not so good compared to care package - the engine for pc is broken and the experience to play decent required a lot of changes on video configuration even though some cpu lag is present - the game overall was design for low past gameplays and for camper players  Despite the negatives aspects of call of duty ghosts overcame the positive, this game is only recomended for those who are adict to call of duty franchise, otherwise stay away from it.  6 out 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is one unpolished piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Gotta say, it was alright at first. Broken, but playable. Both Solo and multi were tolerable. And still worth a low cost buy. Now? after all these BS 'update patches' I can safely say this is another COD game that just keeps getting worse instead of better. If you like throwing money away, by all means. But this series has turned into a played out joke. The same BS every year. And this installment is no exception. as of 2/1/14? This is one broken, laggy, frame drop filled, modder infested FAIL. 4.5/10  However, you do have an occasional good game. So if your a cod fan and you can get this one for ender 30.00 might as well go for it. :P"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no offline play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same Sh!t. This should be called MW4. activision can go Fu*k them selves because they really Fu*ked up this time. This sh!t is worse than Black ops II
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't just, don't. For the love of all things on this planet, do not buy this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont recommand
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Let me tell you something. Here new titles cost 75$. Is this game worth 75 dollars? No. It's worth 15. Why? It's a horrible PC port with frame rate issues out of the â™¥â™¥â™¥ left and right. The cheating is insane and lag is real. Washed out graphics and very poor gun choice. If you have an option to buy any COD you should consider Black Ops 2 or something else. Just not this. This is just bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst off the worst! If you buy this game youre an idiot, and i will come into your bedroom at night and penetrate you for buying this game! Trust Me! That was what happened to me when i buuyed this game! The game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed me in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ because it sucked so much! Its worse than eetee the extra terrestrial!   I juust hate this game so hard!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gr8 b8 m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8. I r8 this b8 an 8/8."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What the hell is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it frezes after the helicoper. it sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nothing much to complain about &lt;$15 game...i know how bad is it:-)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is so bad that Activision disabled the option to uninstall. 2/10  ***Disclaimer*** I may be too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to uninstall bad games.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,By far the most disappointing entry into the CoD franchise for me so far...but some say that's because I haven't tried MW3 yet. Textures need fixing from the get-go...it looks old and amateurish by current standards. The game feels clunky and lacks flow. CoD reached its peak at MW and this edition is just another tired entry on the downhill slope that CoD has become.  The single-player campaign is just a re-hash of missions from CoD 4 MW amd others.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you are getting this game for the single player go ahead buy the game.  But if want the multiplayer then DO NOT buy the game. This is because it is really laggy, it does not have much players on some of the game modes and it keeps asking you for MORE money every time you try play on multiplayer.   If you want a good CoD game then buy Cod: Black opps II or CoD: Advanced Warfare or any others. BUT NOT THIS"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The last COD I'll ever buy!  message to activision, infinity ward, sledgehammer and everyone involved with this franchise:  YOU have been weighed, YOU have been measurded, and YOU have been found wanting.  COD lost a day one fan."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't do it..... Don't you dare click that buy button.... back away from the mouse. Not even worth the 75% off price. IW was too busy playing pool and watching movies in their in-house theater to bother making a decent game..... again. They did manage to fill 40 gigs worth of trash files though. There wasn't anyone playing this game 6 months ago, there won't be now. All you'll have is a terrible and short campaign to play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"absolute garbage dont get it no matter how cheap it is on sale for as i unfortunatly found out. but then again what was i expecting its a call of duty game for gods sake. if ur looking for a cod game get world at war, still the best one ive played to date"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game could of been a lot of fun. But IW decided it would be hilarious to release a game with literally everything wrong with it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I cant believe they even sold this game on PC. Admittedly, my PC isnt the best, but BLOPS2 and Skyrim run on it, no issue. Dont waste money on this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Some of the boards are to big and the others get old fast. This is one that if you have to get it, get it off the clearance rack."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ppl pleases dont buy this garabage even if its on sell to many STUPID HACKERS on day one n still steam and IW wont do anything bout it.They try sell DLC how bout stop them â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no skills hacker before suckering me out of more money &gt;:( This going be my last COD im moving on to bf4 yes i know there crashes n bugs but theres no noob hackers n they been working on fixing them unlike IW bs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Saw story line on youtube because too many bugs and screw ups. But hey at least Multiplayer works, kinda, just have to ignore the wierd yellow lines that pop of on the screen sometimes from the game. Great alternative for when battlefield 4 isnt working. NO SPLIT SCREEN! Video Gamers do have a life? College Kids play Game cube and such because they play with friends. I guess this franchise finds all the billions of their consumers live life alone."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Im not a CoD Pro by anymeans but when i play mulitiplayer its was a bad experience by that i mean join the only game i can play was TDM and 60% of the games i play there are hackers already i understand radar but when they follow you though walls and know exactly where you spawn everytime is annoying. Also not being able to play Any other game modes such as Infected or Kill Confirmed was kinda let down i like to switch it up with those but everytime i try it can never find any games. Also it could just be my computer but i have incountered many graphics glitches like water not loading right and my gun really weird to the point you cant see the screen and even with Red dot sights to will have this line. In all i was dissapointed with what i paid for if i could get a refund im all for it. :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was half-finished, rushed, and terribly conceptualized. The only pro that I can think of was the linear and fairly predictable campaign. The multiplayer games are ridiculously fast paced, insanely taxing with little to no viewable result for the memory and resource hog that it is. Poorly planned, poorly designed, and an all around flop. Given the chance, I'd get a refund and immediately buy BF4 instead of this garbage."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a complete fail of a game for pc it runs fine on really old consoles but gives a very unstable fps on pc I have had this game since release and it is still very unplayable on 12 GB of ram and the game doesn't like steam being open or any other overlays such as fraps. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this game unless they decide to fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward used to be able to pull out amazing adventures with the Campaign mode. Ghosts was disappointing in storytelling and presentation aspects. Riley's stage was probably the most interesting but that was a mere 3 minutes of the entire game? MW3 was still pretty good, so what happened to IW in the last 2 years?  On the technical end, I can't for the life of me figure out how a bigger install for campaign mode looked worse than other AAA shooters like Metro Last Light or BF4 on medium settings.  Fish AI was pretty good though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Community has basically vanished; almost none of the game modes are playable because there aren't enough players - game was hopelessly broken for months. Almost all of the things that matter in a Call of Duty game are missing here: no connection indicators, frame rate problems abound, SLI support was broken for months, no FOV selection, no surround support. Probably the least exciting Call of Duty game ever released."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game be gay and stuff.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,most cheaters
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Less than a 6 hour campaign. Skip this and grab CoD Black Ops 2. Yes I actually play the single player vs MP. IW why even bother with the SP when you care so little for the campaign?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game seems great but for all the hacks that are around, like some of the bigger maps and perks. Edited this to the game has turned to crap, it's a shame"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont buy this game its a crap game ...MW4 its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game ...... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them who made this game......
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game is not optimized for PC. game crashes often and is a pain..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is a fun game. I think they could have taken more time on the graphics. it is pretty much exactly like all of the other CoDs. The multiplayer is sometimes very stale and the same but it can be fun. The singleplayer is very plain. The plot sucks. Over all I dive it a 6/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Missions dragged on, cutscenes stuttered after loading was done, never really told why ghosts are the most elite team ever of all the elite teams in CoD, your grenades are water balloons while enemy grenades are atomic bombs, the dog has a fully modled groin, story is pretty stupid and impossible to make sense of, ending is dum, you can't have a gunfight in space 1/10 cute doge that is only in 3 missions and is dead weight in the 3rd is the only redeaming factor."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"'its as if Infinity Ward has forgotten where they came from, this game is half arsed in all major aspects.'  Single Player is for lack of a better word BORING, nothing is used to grab your emotion nor your worth. Once again you get your hand held though out all EVERY single mission... NOT WORTH YOUR TIME  Multiplayer is another story... Besides all of the FPS drops (90fps average, drops to 10fps) it is quite fun and with a higher learning curve (every weapon is a 3 hit kill) It is the Call of Duty that should of been... Back in 2009 not now  All in all, the multiplayer is full of either tweens or creepy uncle's... In my first match i got called a hacker, n00b, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. got told that my mum was a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. ect. ect.   DONT BUY THIS IF YOU WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT, YOUVE BEEN WARNED!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It sadly takes all the bad things from black ops and repeats them. Its short, way to short. The story is lackluster and chaotic at best. Not to mention you are supposed to be the underdog in this fight. Yeah right, SPOILER! you are not.  Ghosts are supposed to be elite guerilla fighters. Using sneaky tactics and stealth. My â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they are. Modern warfare 1 and 2 had much better sneak/stealth sections. The only real refreshing thing here is the space and underwater sections. And they dont last very long either.  And lets not forget the ever populair ( read hated ) shootouts with infinitely respawning enemies that just keep on coming unless you dash through the bullet-storm towards the next section so the game is forced to move on.   Graphicly the game if very nice, no arguments there. But good graphics cant make up for what is otherwise a mediocre game at best. And if you argue that this game is all about the multiplayer you need to be socked in the mouth with a baseball bat. It does NOT make up for it. And it doesn't justify the pricetag.   If you want to play this wait till it goes on discount sale. otherwise save your heard earned cash.  Personally I think the CoD games reached their peak several games ago, and its time to move on and let the franchise die out. But sadly we all know that won't happen cause CoD fans are some of the most insanely zealous fanboys on the planet."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought this game awhile back just now getting around to a review. As you can see I do not recommend this game, I paid the full 60 bucks for this and I regret it... that's for sure. There's nothing new here at all, story line is 'alright' gun play is dull feels like your tunnel shooting the whole time as in walk to the next person kill repeat. It's a neat concept (the main part of the story) why I was thinking about gettin it in the first place. Don't waste ur money! get BF4; better story-line, gun play is great Instead of this crap. 'Was looking forward to the next one there making for call of duty but after this think I'm good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i have been banned from this game,did noyhing wrong ,hackers screwed me dont buy this game ,i did and all the dopwn loads nice right this is how the game company cares about the people who dont hack"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really great game but the community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with many many try hards :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's alright. Thats really all I have to say about this game. Not great controls with keyboard, buts runs very well on a good PC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very poor pc optimization END OF. can not even exit fullscreen without whole pc coking up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Such an awful game. Bugs, awful story. It did have some good missions. The eneding is the worst. You shoot Rorke IN THE CHEST and he lives. This game sucks goat balls. ITS A PILE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Thisnis the worst call of duty ever. It is an embarrasment not only to the creators but to the players as well. First off the maps are way too big and there all the same: destroyed urban maps. And the engine is bloaty. And extinction is just plain stupid
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same old stuff. Nothing new or groundbreaking.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,terrible oc port dont buy this garbage
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This has to be the worst Call of Duty to date. Runs terribly on PC, nothing reall new in terms of features, terrible lag compensation, and all around, they could have done a lot better. I feel like they reall tried to do something new for the series, but nothing new works."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While this game was fun at first, I got bored of it quickly. Alot of people who have played every COD snce MW1 or earlier would probably agree with me in saying that this game gets boring quick. The graphics look pretty good but the gameplay doesn't really stand out. Extinction fun a few times but doesn't have a lot of replay value, Campagn is fun once or twice but again not a lot of replay value, and the multiplayer is fun but gets boring quick since it's really nothing that new and spectacular.  Another reson why I was disapointed with this game was the fact that this game isn't really a completed game, their was lots of screen stuttering and screen tearing at launch and some of the features like PhysX don't even exist yet. Also for the first few weeks the online was pretty much unplayable because of the constant lag, but that has been mostly fixed since launch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a terrible PC port. The community for PC was dead day 1. Most people are only playing TDM rather than the other modes available.  They fixed some of the day 1 image quality issues but still a dead communtiy already.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD: Modern Combat Unrefined would be a great alternate title for this game. I don't blame activision for this monstrosity of a game, I blame Infinity Ward. I'd bet my left nut that when Treyarch gets COD back in their court that the game will be phenomenal once again. Until then I hope BF4 will be able to fill the gap for you all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the first CoD I bought and it will be the last one (from Infinity Ward). While TreyArch made a 'great' game with Black ops 2 I really enjoyed playing, at a friends, I decided to get my hands on my first own CoD, Ghosts that is, but they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up so hard. Not only there is no FOV changer, what I kind of understand because the consoles don't have it either and I think they wanted to be 'fair', however it is also so bad ported onto the pc that it's unplayable, even on high end PCs. The multiplayer is fun at times even with the laggs and fps crashes so that's at least one plus point. The graphics are nothing phenomenal, they look worse than the ones in Crysis 1 , and are never worth around 26 GB of space. Let's get to the single player *sigh*. It's your standard action-fps. Not good story telling, gets boring pretty quickly and you don't get any emotions towards the characters but everyone knows that CoD is a 'multiplayer game' and no one buys it only for the really awesome campaign. Although CoD isn't the best singleplayer game it is so good because of the multiplayer but as I said they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up aswell so there is really no point in wasting your money just wait for the next.   FINAL VERDICT: 5.5/10 DON'T buy this game. As I enjoy it from time to time I just can't recomend this to anybody right now if you really want to buy it no one is going to stop you but I will never buy anything that is programmed by IW. I've learned my lesson. At least TA tries to make a stable pc port but I'm going to wait for what's coming and meaybe they fix it.  Graphics   + (They improved and it looks really pretty sometimes, even though the grass remembers me on WarZ)  Gameplay  + (Smooth and makes fun as always, if you're lucky and it doesn't lagg)  Singleplayer  - (Really poor 5 hours for a full price 59â‚¬/69$ game)  Story   - (As I said it's a poor told story)  Performance  - (SO BAD PORTED I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP, nuf said)  Weapons  +/-(There could be some more but they're somewhat acepptable)  Sound  + (The weapons and the charactors at least sound really good)  Atmosphere  + (Good war atmosphere, at least)  Multiplayer  + (It's good, makes fun and is competitive but you get killed way too quickly and there is this ping/host problem)  Personally  - (I'm really sad it turned out like this I paid for it was really excited and in the end I can't even play it on the   lowest settings without laggs, even if they say I'm able to play it on medium. The performence issues ruined   this game in my eyes)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't... Even... Think... about buying this, it is not worth it, doesn't run well (even with good GPUs) multiplayer has a lot of lag and the campaing is the only thing that is not so bad. Go spend your money in another game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terrible game, crashes every few mins..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is dump, defenetly NOT WORTH 60â‚¬ !!!    For the one who wanna know more:  Singleplayer: - Linear very boring, very unrealistic gameplay - Extreme short singleplayer (although i played on the highest difficulty it took around 5 hours only) - They wanted to put more emotion into 'Ghost'  - U can see that they tried to do that, but they obviously missed something on the human nature... As u know u cant change the story (cause its linear) u dont worry about ur squad. If someone dies u either restart the mission or he just returns in the next mission (if he is a main character) - The Grapics still sucks + U CAN SHOOT THROUGH WALLS - Health Regeneration (its just crappy...) - gameplay neither intense nor interesting + SOME COOL DOG MISSIONS  -&gt; dog = too intelligent and overpowered - A few very hard laggs and bugs - Boring armory  Multiplayer: + U CAN PRUCHASE EQUIPMENT FOR UR CHAR!!! THAT IS JUST AWESOME  -&gt; too few different types of equipment... also no ghost masks which u can put different colours in or so... - There are still those annoying NAT-Types which completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u up if ure not a computer nerd who fixes that in minuites - Everything else is like the other Multiplayers of that Series......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where should I start... I have been trying to find the good in this game but, it comes up completely short of the great gaming experience promised. The graphics are not what I expected, especially considering all the hype from the developers. The gameplay, well it doesnâ€™t exist. The maps are far to large for the amount of players and spawn points are rediculous. The frame rates drop at the worst times and the mouse input feels like I have touretteâ€™s. This probably part due to the fact, there are no dedicated servers and we are on some weird console port.   Considering that this is one of the biggest game franchises out there, it seems that the testing of this game in different environments didnâ€™t happen or that they just could have care less of the gamerâ€™s experience. I will say it is slightly better now than at release but, I still could not suggest this game as a purchase until they address some major concerns."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game crashes randomly, multiplayer is so so, laggy and not as good as BO2. I'll always be a COD fan, but if I were to skip one, this would be the one to skip. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Poor PC port of a Xbox game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"absolute garbage, can't believe i wasted my money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you are one of those who don't have much common time with your friends to play online or simply you like to play single player, this may isn't a game for you. The campaign for single player is way too short, i had many cheaper games with longer lifespan. 5 hours it took me to get the single player campaign done, so not worth the money paid. Many said that BlackOps 2 was a lot longer. Graphics, controls and gameplay are very good and up to date, but the single player lifespan is not up to date This game is mainly aimed at multiplayer fans"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am a shooter fan I played CoD and BF for many years I have never been dissapointed with either franchise to the degree that I am with this game. First off they have some incredibly ugly textures throughout multiplayer that just makes you lose all immersion. Bugs polluted the launch and bad servers still plague it.  Do your self a favor and take this advice as a huge Black ops 2 fan. Go buy Battlefield 4 and play its domination mode, wait till they patch this game into working order. I'll update when they do"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer does not make the best of what makes Call of Duty fun; close quarters maps that force teams into run and gun strategies which elevate the level of fun by fast paced FPS gameplay. While it's maps are not the best in the series, the actual fun level suffers because of the unfinished gameplay mechanics that reduce both the levels of fairness and immersion.  I do not recommend this addition to the series and go as far as to instead replay/purchase earlier installments, Black Ops and Modern Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's ridiculous how Infinity Ward managed to regurtitate the same franchise over and over, gain success, but suddenly crashes and burns. This is exactly how Call of Duty: Ghosts feels like - a bigger slap than what Modern Warfare 2 is to Call of Duty 4.  Single player offers the exact, same plot as the previous titles did (don't get fooled by the 'underdog' title), with just a little mix and matching between Modern Warfare/Black Ops titles. And you father in-game dies in the most cliched way possible. I mean, you simply haven't been presented with a way to connect with the guy, other than calling him 'dad' (just kidding, you're *surprise!* mute). No character depth whatsoever. Even the main villian is straight out of recent hollywood flicks - disgruntled former military person gets left behind and holds a grudge? Please.   Expect guns, goons and gratuitous explosions, but it just feels like the same CoD experience you had in the last 6 years. But you get to control a dog. Is that a good point? Frankly, no, since it's the same 'go-to-this-checkpoint-while-we-the-developers-make-sure-you-don't-get-spotted-at-all' kind of thing.   Ooh, and SPACE! You get to have firefights in space. Which is a little cool, if it's not frustratingly hard to find and pop out of cover due to your altered acceleration/deceleration. But you're in space. So I'll let it slide.  Multiplayer is an even bigger letdown, with massive latency issues and ill frame rates. Not to mention the maps, that are seemingly carbon copies of the map Downturn in MW3. It sucked not only in visuals, but also in map layout - it's like they're expecting everyone to either camp or run as a Maniac. Every map in Ghosts is like that, I swear. 'Dynamic' maps are supposed to break that habit, but considering that's only one map (a pre-order bonus, at that), you'd think they should've done a good job. Except they didn't. Because it's not dynamic, it's just a heavily-scripted, moving-platforms version of (yes) Downturn!  Overall, kudos to the space concept (a nice surprise, actually), but the rest just falls down hard. I regret pre-ordering this on retail, and I guess, I'm just lucky to have bought the Standard edition.  YES * High production value on set-pieces (especially the space parts) * Great graphics  NO * Single-player campaign drags on * Utter reliance on set-pieces instead of great gameplay * Crappy support for low-end systems * Multiplayer maps are terribad * You'll lag hard on multiplayer  Verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i have 45 Euro's flusht to the toilet. DX error, DX error, Dx error...bla, bla,la. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cant get past first screen, there is a Bug that does not allow you to proceed, gets in a loop then says you failed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought it on black friday because it was 40 something dollars and I thought to myself 'how bad could it be'.  Waste of money. Graphics from 2005, similar gameplay if not same from old cod games. Graphics can't compete with any of the games that came out recently. BF4 looks like candy compared to this. You know, actually crysis 1 might have better textures than this game.   Every 3 match you get a hacker in your lobby, and someone while making the game decided that you should be only able to report people while in lobby not while playing. There is no vote to kick or something so you either quit the game or take the beating from the hacker. Hackers leave the lobby as soon as game ends and that way they never get reported.   It lags, it has obvious bugs, and best thing is that you need a 1500$ computer to run it. Even then it lags, fps drops out of nowhere. This game was built for consoles and then poorly optimized for PC.  There is no audio adjust, only master volume.So if you want to lower the music to hear what is happening while playing game, good luck. You will hear this irrelevant music suddenly out of no where while you are listening for footsteps.   Gamepad support? Only if you have a xbox controller. Even if you have xbox controller, you can only choose 4-5 pre-set options for your gamepad. No custom button config. If you want to shoot with R1 and aim with L1, good luck there is no such a thing.  But hey, you can be a female soldier or run with a knife thru whole game. What a breakthrough...  I watched youtube videos and read some nice reviews on this game, but god people who does not get paid to review this game won't give more than 10/2.  Cod was a nice game once, not anymore. It started getting big on PC first, now they lost that PC thing and only making games for newgen fail consoles that comes out of box not working.   Way to go, pay every reviewer and think that people will keep buying. From now on, even if you say you give the secret of life on your games I am not paying for it... I am just sad because cod was such a fun game to play and now they are pushing unfinished games.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unoptimized garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can`t play. Game crashes in first few seconds.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Activision and IW give me my money back. I have a beast of a gaming PC and your game is essentially unplayable. I have loved and played the $^@% out of previous CoDs. Suffice it to say this may be the worst game on release I have ever seen. One month later ZERO improvement. Also I should mention that dedicated servers were promised (reason I picked up the game) and then not delivered. That is fraud. Your game is bad and you should feel bad. No thats not harsh enough, your game is an abortion and you should feel bad. There."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Better name for this fu....g game is 'Lag of duty'!  - worst graphics. - cheaters. - lags. - bad designed maps (multiplayer). - perks (it's something).  You'll better think twice before you'll spend your money on this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multiplayer is disasterious. cheating and boosting so wide spreaded,you cant get in game without at least 1 player beeing a god da.n god.  i reportet every suspicious player,but to know that they were inspected and banned would be great.  Single player is like all the other single players. short and poor story. same all same all.  In multiplayer i miss at most the option in witch you could choose and create the servers like in cod4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cheat and hack city, with the developers doing little to stop it. no punkbuster or anti cheat. Multi player maps are small as any call of duty. same as its previuos versions just renamed perks that do the same thing.  Not a new game but more a expansion and for Â£40 a waste of money.  Play planetside 2 its free and massive in comparison."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Barely played 20 mins and already a buggy mess. An adundance of control issues, long loading times amongst others. Worst COD game ever made."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pile of dirt!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"High end pc, can't even get 30 fps, even though I got 125+ on all previous titles.   0/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity ward and Activision wouldn't know what a game is if it where made for them.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Constant Freezes, every five to ten minutes of gameplay it freezes for 15 seconds. Seriously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is boring Multiplayer is garbage Extinction is mediocre Don't buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This one is so over the top I was annoyed with it. The friendly AI is good for yelling at you, and not much else. The cover system barely makes any sense. This will be the last call of duty game I ever purchase, even on sale like this one was."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,is the multiplayer alive?  is it lag free?  are spawn points on point? is it worth the buy           YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  &nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Insanely bad stuttering, sadly it cant even reach its own 'CoD' standards..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's call of duty. A bad game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In a market where the gaming dollar is strecthed thinner everyday. Activision has released what feels like an incomplete insult to the gaming community.   I have never been the largest COD player, I surely fall into the casual section for this titles but none the less I have played all the predecessors and while not all have been perfect gems none have been a complete lump of coal like this one.   Poorly optimized, bad balancing, boring story, and just a lackluster effort all together,   In the end thats what turns me off the most is that in this Market Activision feels that we MUST buy COD. so their doesn't seem to be any effort.   COD Ghosts 1/5   Check out my other reviews and add me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well all I can say is just please don't ever buy this game, a month after release it is still unplayable. I have a pretty decent pc (can run blops 2 pc on high settings at 120fps) yet this game on low settings struggles to hit 40 frames. Their are no dedicated pc options whatsoever, no fov slider, dedicated peak around corner keys, no true dedicated servers (disgracefully slow server, p2p hybrid bs), 60GB install file for a game which even on the highest settings still doesn't look overly special - just a few more shades of brown and grey. The gameplay itself is the slowest in the franchise, with the worst spawn point system conceivable in a game. Wish I had seen reviews of this game before (ie the modal score of 0/10 on the metacritic website). So yeah, last time I give these crooks any money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single Player While I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign story, the gameplay itself however is very simple. The game holds your hand throughout the levels leaving very little room for you to find/figure things out on your own.  Multiplayer The multiplayer is like every other CoD game, few enhancements, minor tweaks, lots of bugs, many people complaining. The initial start off was, and probably still is, plagued by bloated MIN requirements, constant FPS drops despite having a decent rig, aimbots/wallhacks/boosters, random CTD's and no dedicated servers. There are a handful of people that have gotten lucky and don't have any issues running the game though.  Overall, there are too many problems with Ghosts right now to consider this a good buy. I'm glad I bought this game at a deep discount but still regret spending $35 for it. 6/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no need to buy blops 2 is better and that game still sucked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pros: The name  Cons: Every thing  1/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am not a huge fan of Call of Duty anymore, but this game is just awful.  They some how managed to remove many features that they added in the previous game, as well as give the game worse textures.  Not only that, but the game runs horrible. Online is also very unplayable and laggy.  I would highly suggest not buying this game. It's not worth it. It needs so much work to be playable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"like pulling teeth, 6 hours of gameplay I had to stretch over about 2 years because I couldnt sit through more than 1/2-1 level at a time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cool singleplayer storyline, but the rest unfortunately lacks a lot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good background, but poorly delivered.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have had nothing but trouble with ghost. Get error message that it didn't load correct so i have uninstalled 2 times and reinstalled it with same results or it will freeze and i gave to reastart computer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dosent start i cant go play it i just download it and its just say steam error when i try to start it-,-"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lmao already that cods were â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this happens                still better than aw  1/20
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Waste of Money and waste of time. No doubt this game has the highest discounts and is sold at around 5â‚¬.  If you're looking for a great Call of Duty game, look up for the Treyarch's Call of Duty (Black Ops series).  If you're looking for a cheap Call of Duty game, then you shouldn't buy Call of Duty. There ain't nothing cheap here that is worth to buy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"5/10 enjoyed the campaign, but hated the multiplayer, it's too chaotic, random and messy, the high pace can be fun at times, but mostly, for me, it feels like a manic running and shooting in all directions game, without any real strategy to it, admittedly i'm a battlefield player, the team spirit from BF is missing in COD, spend around 9 hours on the campaign and 45 min. on the multiplayer, simply could not be bothered to play more, i did play COD on PS3, but hoped something had changed doing all these years, still the same old arena concept.   to be fair, Ghost is all stars when it comes to controls, sound and graphics, let's be honest, this is really well done, if you have ever tried to rig 3D character and animating a run'n'jump cycle, you'll know how hard it's been to create a game like this, so credits on that part.  Reason for my thumb down, is entirely due personal preferences, and the fact that i payed full price on this title, i really don't enjoy COD's multiplayer format, if your an Battlefield fan, try it before buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game was one of the worst games I've ever played. It was super generic and I don't even like the series in fact it is an awful series (the ww2 ones were good though) and I don't really see anything new. It was so awful that it managed to be worse than black ops 2 so don't waste your money on this game if it even is one so my rating 1/10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only 2 good things this game did for me was forcing me to install Win 7 64-bit and curing my CoD addiction.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. once the new COD came out the game would no longer play, after a few months it would play, but youde get banned VAC almost instantly. biggest scam ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why are you even looking at this game?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great multiplayer gameplay! Not so impressive campaign!! Almostno one plays this game now and I don't know why, in spite of the amazing online gameplay! Not recommened."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,2/10 would not buy - lag compensation ruins it - horrible 'hosts' - lied about dedicated servers - horrible graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is bad, does not have a good story, there's isn't anything new to the franchise, just repeating what previous games did, and the textures... oh boy ... the textures look like they have been made in 2002, I've seen better textures in Spider-Man 2 (which I think its from 2004)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like cod but this one sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"didnt live up to expectations on pc,been getting a little better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just dont buy it. Its hardly playable because its badly ported to the pc. Those frame rate drops tho
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multiplayer maps too small, only good for box fight style gaming."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,hope they come up w/ an update that fixes all this crap. i should have just bought a premium membership for my bf4 than buying this. they should have sticked with treyarch.graphics look like the cod 3 yrs ago.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terribly unoptimised. Those others who have left negative comments about this game, however abhorent, are mostly correct."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"unoptimized, cheaters in almost every lobby, total lack of rentable dedicated servers, no ping bar preordering will get you a free fall i didn't saw it since launch 0 players in playist of free fall included large framerate drops, safeguard and extinction causing BSOD (blue screen of death) and much much more stuff..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game to anyone, it lags, crashes and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s up all the time.  Cannot even launch campaign without it crashing right after the intro. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game ever, I can run BF4 on ultra without any issues but a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game like this I cannot. Stupid."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too jittery, screen freezes in online combat every single time an enemy is encountered at close quarters, once it unfresses, youre dead. I expected much more than this from Infinity Ward, but cant say Im surprised with their publisher being Activision- they have a long history of forcing release of games before theyre ready and releasing multiple bug fixes and patches later. Its more frustrating than anything to just turn the game on at all, hoping to have a fun time and end up angry instead. Worthless and cant even be called 'entertainment' as far as I see it. I have a mid range machine (8 core i7, 2 GB dual video cards and 8 GB DDR3 Ram) as far as this game requirements are concerned, but its no slouch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sixty dolloars to keep playing the same maps over and over. Plus the level scheme has no curve what-so-ever because you are granted access to every gun and attachment right off the bat. OH but you COULD play HUNDREDS of hours to get the elite perks. They make a little bit of difference. So yeah. Oh and campaign is cheesy as crap again no surprise there but hey there's always the long-term playing and dynamic multiplayer =D (Sarcasm is your friend).
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This was the last game I bought in the COD line-up of games. I've never really got to play it because I remember having serious performance issues with the multiplayer. I thought it was my PC until my friend having a much greater PC than I - having the exact same issues. So I tried out the single player, and it was somewhat playable and decent experience, but it still has a lot of problems even 2 years later. There's a lot of freeze moments even in the single player, where it pauses for 5 seconds and then get back into the action. It's very frustrating, but I kept my patience and eventually completed the game. It also has a lot of performance issues, like the framerates and the sound glitches and stutters in the loading menu as well.  For god sake don't Alt-Tab this game, since it will lag for around 10 minutes.   I actually only bought this game, because it was on sale for an insanely cheap price. Having no research on Ghost I never really faced the problems until I played the actually game. The graphics in this game aren't any improvement over the past games, and I can't really figure out why the game is about 40GB. Compare to a game like GTA that's around 60GB. Like what the hell happened? I've heard that IW didn't really care about the PC games, which definitely shows.  For a spin-off from MW2, it's alright. I had no to little expectations for this game, but it was very obvious that tried really hard. This game sort of destroys the purpose of Ghost in MW2, since I thought he was unique, but since there're multiple ghosts - he is bleak. The ending really leads up to a sequel, which is so anti-climatic and awkward overall. I like the fact that he's captured and being tortured as well, but they should just have found a way to end it, without leading up to the next game. Especially for a game like Ghost, where there's not much potential to renew themselves since it's straight up a spin-off of already existing material.  I'm not going to recommend this game to anybody. I'm sorry. I know the COD games has always been about the multiplayer I know, but what I've heard about their performance issues and a lot of stupid choices in customization. Not even the singleplayer is worth it. If you want a decent story - pay the same amount of money for a more in-depth singleplayer. Don't pick Call Of Duty. I only played it, because I had it in my library."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,lol absolute garbage no balance why did I spend my damn money on this!~?!????!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for full price, you're an idiot. this game sucks. Full of Campers since 2013."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game just sucks. im really disappointed as Infinity Ward was the maker and they are usually on...but this one was way off. the controls and feel are just not smooth.   single player - well, the campaign is ehh. the storyline isnt all that great, and the characters are somewhat boring. the missions havent been anything like previous games where you'd want to replay them.  multiplayer - here is where the sh!t really starts to stink. the MP is dead for a reason. its awful. on top of the controls and feel being off, they have piled on garbage maps. there is nothing about the MP that makes you want to play it over any of the previous CoD games.    "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, lets just say I was disapionted in the Multiplayer, but the Singleplayer makes up for it. So I would not recommend this game for the following reasons: Number 1: It takes away the thing I like most about COD... Being a Badass :D so yeah you cant run into a room and think you are going to kill all of them. No my dear friends not in this COD your lucky if you get a hitmarker honest to God. Number 2: There is no COD that is better than MW3 and BO 2 I recommend BO2 if your into high tech stuff like a scope letting you see behind corners a fair warning though there will be 12 year old boys raging all the time that the only bad thing bout the game and MW3 if you love a good shoot em up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Please don't buy this game cause you will be sorry. It sucks hard. Multiplayer servers are dead. Story mode is lame.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why do I keep doing this? Is it the fond memories of MW that makes me think COD games will offer me a good fps experience? I don't know, but what I do know is that this is an unispired on rails shooter with an appalingly silly story. It has one redeeming feature, a dog, but even that can't save this game. I got to wise up and stop buying these things."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's Call of Duty. What can I say?  Ghosts has a really silly plot, really silly setting, really silly over-the-top action and it's just the sort of mindless violence-candy one might want every now and then. The game tells the tale of how the big bad South America united against the poor ol' underdog USA and stole the US's secret space weapons tech and... boy... that WAS really stupid!  Oh, and if you like dogs, don't get this game. I love dogs and it broke my heart to have to 'control' a dog at one point, tearing out the throats of a couple dozen people who were just doing their jobs. The dog in this game LOOKS adorable, but it is a cold-blooded murder-monster and I hate it. Screw the dog!  A lot of the special effects, such as fire and explosions, even at the highest settings, look like poorly made transparent gifs overlaid on top of the 3D models. I'm guessing this is some sort of tweak made for parity with the console versions, considering how noticeable the effect is.  I can't recommend Ghosts simply because the older Call of Duties did pretty much all the same things, but better. Except for the space shooting, that was pretty badass.   Playtime: 6+ hours (single playthrough)   Ratings (1-10) Visual: 7 Audio: 8 Story: 5 Gameplay: 7 Overall: 7   *** DOG - SPOILER ***  The dog does not die! It just gets forgotten about really quickly and then just sort of disappears for the latter half of the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"59.99eur without dlc for this ?? bundle for 179.99eur ? are u â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding me ????? game from 2013 ? game is dead, dev do not work more on this, multiplayer is full of hackers and they do not do anything with that.. do not buy this is only recycled previous games, i was stupid i bought it.. 2/10 boring, hackers, bad optimalization, bad graphics.. sorry but this game is piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sadly its horrible
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TOO MANY ISSUES FOR THIS GAME!.....ITS NOT FUN AT ALL...FLICKERING! LOW FPS....JUST PLAIN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!..MULTIPLAYER IS BLAAAAA......IT SUCKS!.. SAVE YOU MONEY!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not going to go into the details as they are QUITE documented, but will say stay away like the plague"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Until they get the anti hack program that is affective this game will always suck. Also the spawn points being random are terrible. You get killed from spawning more then anything else
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is one of the worst games I have ever played, I am not going to waste my time going into a full review of it because it's totally not worth my time. The graphics are worse than Modern Warfare 3, the field of view is hopeless and controls are very unimpressive. Long story short, not really much to talk about in this game, the levels are a load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, $80 wasted in my opinion. I was really excited about this game, the day it came out, the day I played it, I lost all hope for the remainder of the Call of Duty series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No. Plays poorly on my nVidia 570 even though FPS are 45+. Dropping settings does not improve as much as it should. Also, I am still getting lots of GPU driver crashes well over a month after release. Multiplayer is full of cheaters/hackers so not as much fun as I expected. My recommendation is to buy this for console where at least it will run smoothly and have much less cheaters.  Game is okay. It is CoD which I like but nothing new. I much prefer BO2 for the faster pacing of multiplayer but if you like a more cautious, slower pace, then Ghosts will appeal to you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has great graphics and gameplay, but it is extremely broken and unfinished. Extremely unstable framerates and lots of framerate drops, especially if you look at a dog with dynamic fur on. Singleplayer is too short and linear, but still fun. Multiplayer doesn't even work. It just keeps saying that it can't be connected to the online services everytime I try to play multiplayer. The patches just made it worse. Even more unstable framerate and now multiplayer won't even launch. The game is unplayable in it's current condition. Only singleplayer works, but there's just so much jerky mouse movements and unstable framerate, it is hard to enjoy. I give cod ghosts a solid 2 out of 10!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD EVER ! cheaters all the way and nothing is done by steam or COD developpers. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst think i might go back to blops2 if i rly rly rly need to play call of duty again!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very poorly made game. COnsidering that a lot of elements of the previous games have been reused, many PC players including myself are having framerate issues and input lag/ mouse acceleration issues meaning that multiplayer is just a frustrating experience that is only memorable because of the huge sense of disapointment and disbelief you're left with. One pro though is that the single player is still alright as expected and it's clear they've tried to polish the game a little more but still this does little to redeem its other shortcomings, which are to numerous to count. truly unforgivable considering the size of the developer and the age of the franchise..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,There is no ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pathetic performance on a PC. Very dissapointed in this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Looks like poop, blury pooo. No ones playing online only 1000. Another bad COD game we should know better by now."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, I play Ghost because it's fun sometimes to get some fast-phase shooting (when im not playing Battlefield 4), but if someone were to ask me 'Should I buy ghost?' I'd say no.. I do no recommend this game in anyway. It honestly feels like a console game they have run throught their 'convert to PC'-program.  It sounds harsh, but it's not worth it guys :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst port to PC i have ever seen by a big organization like IW. Also for some reason, max settings gives me extremely low fps, and the graphics still look like 2009. Almost any other call of duty is better. I wouldn't spend $5 on this game. Also note this games takes close to 45GB to download."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be either a bunch of hackers or some people who troll the community with millisecond accuracy. I give up. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the franchise. Had enough. No more call of duty purchases for me. What a waste of time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is pretty bad. I played multiplayer for about 250hours. I would rate singleplayer 3/10 and the multiplayer 7/10.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the absolute worst PC port of a game that I have ever seen!! I have an i7 processor, 16GB ram, and the Nvidia GTX 690 and i still cant play this game without frame drops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,terrible game this is the worst cod game ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is not worth the money. Only extinction is somewhat good
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same cod,bad gameplay,bad graphics,bad singleplayer,bad multiplayer.I think this was the worst cod Ä± have ever seen.I did only enjoy while uninstalling the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've never been able to play this game first because of requirements and second after buying a new computer due to lag this is a disgrace to all the cod games ever released. Nothing compares to mw2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The release offers interesting, albeit lousy graphics and networking capabilities. Furthermore, links to download content from the 'store' takes you to the 'store' and not to the content (e.g. Festive pack) that you want to download - finding things from there I might have time 'to figure out' this weekend. Graphics frame rates are so poor that I am killed by guys that aren't showing up on my end yet. Wireless networking skills and packet optimizations on the part of the developers are so ridiculious I am finished writing this very disappointed review, of 45 hours of online play."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is... in 1 word: TERRIBLE! bad performance! bad PC Port! nothing new! so disappointing and ugly! Don't buy it! don't spend your money on it! don't even think about it! at first I thought that the 10th installment of the game will be something new and great but.... I went to far with my thoughts. this game sucks and I regret every cent I spent for this game. This game is DEAD! the singleplayer was good, I liked it a little bit, the storyline was good, but the multiplayer and the performance are terrible. if you want this game, buy it for the consoles, because this game is terrible for PC. I give this game 4.5/10. bad game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All of the small positives are completely overshadowed by the countless negatives that this Call of Duty brings. It not only strays away from the map layout/designs that made the game extremely successful in the past, but has even tweaked gameplay mechanics to feel more 'realistic' &amp; 'tactical', when really it only makes for nothing but frustration. This is not Insurgency or Battlefield, it is the faster paced arcade FPS known as Call of Duty. Infinity Ward should learn to keep it that way."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The singleplayer was allright but was only about 4-5 hours for me.  Now the main thing I wanted to write is about the Multiplayer. For me the Multiplayer was that good and was the thing I was most looking forward too. What let it down is mostly the port. For example while playing the game I do experience some lag (But playable) but the more bigger issuse is the snipers. I like using snipers but in this when you scope in its halfs your fps. (Same as some normal scopes) One minor issuse is the game locks at 90-91 Fps. My setting are on mid-low.  Basic Specs: (If you want to know. I reakon have something better or about the same as mine for a better experience.) GPU: GTX 660 2 GB VRAM CPU: AMD FX 8320 at 3.50Ghz RAM: 8 GBs OS: Windows 7 64bit
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didn't have the performance issues others have reported. Though my system is relatively high-end (i7-3770/24Gb/Radeon 7800) and I only use it for gaming. So it runs fine.  Did anyone quality controlled this game? In a private match you cannot get more than 99 kills/deaths/captures/whatever, or it doesn't show in stats until FINAL game stats. That then asks the question what final (???) game stats. Yes, there are two different levels of leaving a game. And the 99 limit is on both of them. It's not a huge problem. But it deinitely shows very poor quality control and testing.  This will be my last time buying a COD at full price absolutely."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if you dont have the right video driver you will not be able to play it so stupid WORST WAIST OF 60$ EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crap game too much lag in game play. Black Ops still a better game. Shame really instead of getting better it gets worse :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I WANT MY MONEY BACK PLEASE
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is terrible spend your money on something better!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst CoD to date. So bad in fact it has made me go back to Counter Strike for my FPS fix...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,CAll of duty ghost is crap i have constant screen flicker which is verry distracting and verry anoying it even goes black at time ....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game crashes my machine! W7 Pro 64 bit. Sabertooth 990 FX MB, AMD 8 core liquid cooled 4.7 Ghz CPU, 8 GB RAM, Seagate 480 GB SSD, Nvidia GeForce GTX 5870 Graphics card.  This should be more than enough to run this game. I think we need an update!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you can run it without immense and ridiculous lag from terrible optimization, multiplayer is fun enough to sustain interest over a week or two online. Also because of this, hardly anyone plays so good lucking finding a match for anything other than TDM..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A lof of cheaters
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terribly optimized, runs with the same frames as battlefield 4 on my high end rig. terribly made sticking to ps4 version"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothing more to say. Bad FPS, takes too long to find lobbies, overall failure for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BUG, LAG, CHEATERS ! Get my money back !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game, totally waste your money. I've bought this game for a month and still can't launch, crash immediately after launch!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the biggest piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that ever entered my steam library. It runs like a toaster, and looks like it just came out of a barber salon in the middle of Pakistan. The mouse moves like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Big let down, big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"hackers everywhere, too long to find a game, give the community dedicted servers sow e can play the game the way we want, from the location we want, with the settings we want, then we can also ban hackers from the servers without ruining the game for everyone  LISTEN TO THE CUSTOMERS - WE WANT DEDICATED SERVERS FOR PC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is without a doubt the worst Call of Duty ever. The maps are to large for 6v6 and encourage nothing but camping. The spawns are just broken, enemy will literally spawn right behind u. No balance at all with weapons. Scorestreaks are weak, Assault scorestreaks are worthless and best on is support w/ lame dood with shield. Cheating is out of control on PC. Aimbots Wallhacks, ability to fly, invincibility, go under map u name it, its there. Those that cheat do not get VAC banned.   My clan, to a man, all want a REFUND!!! Do not buy this game!!!! Go back to Black Ops II and get Battlefield 4. Activision / Blizzard is currently all FAIL. I will never buy an Infinity Ward product ever again. I own 200+ games on steam and this is the ONLY game I do NOT RECOMMEND."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Some great Inovations and Changes that are ruined by such a poor PC PORT   Many of the changes are a move in the right direction; however, this is the worse PC release in call of duty's history. Fans of the series may remember Black Ops1 as having many technical issues on launch but they were nothing in comparison to this. If you have a GTX Titan prepare for a mediocre looking game to bring it to it's knees as frames will frequently drop down into the 40s on the best hardware.  If you are a gamer who doesn't mind cranking down the settings to get decent performance then this game is for you. Potentially great game but just too flawed on PC... DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible, waist of money! Terrible optimization, frequent FPS drops, low quality textures."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,load of crap !!!!1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its very terrible. Why I say so, this is why. 1. I played so many multiplayer games, this is the only game that keeps giving me the connection time out when I am at my climax. 2. Many modes... wow. Great. When you select other modes, not 1 game available. People only play TDM. Seriously man, why just TDM have players. Efforts by game designer wasted. I prefer COD MW1 where there are fix servers to play. At least I know I can find people inside there.  I am not going to give any reviews about the weapons, each series there are different weapons, only thing I find it irritating is people run around with unlimited stamina and uses the a shotgun with rapid fire equip with silencer and kills people in TDM. No tactics, just random running and killing. I feel like this game is just like another Unreal Tournament.   The good part, is only the story. Good job on the single player I guess.  So in the end, this game I won't recommend to anyone. Its a waste of money. USD$50 plus for just the story mode? I rather watch youtube."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward is just getting lazy now. This game is not worth a full $60. Maxing out all the settings, the textures and graphics are still crappy in the single player campaign. If you are looking to play a bunch of Multiplayer, you better be using Nvidia's Geforce Experience to optimize it right, without the right optimization, you will either get 1 of 2 outcomes: 1) Really good graphics, and really low refresh rate, 2) Really bad graphics and really good refresh rate. Either or, both are going to produce Refresh Rate spikes, and drops which makes playing this game very unfavorable.  Even looking back on it Call of Duty 4 still looks pretty damn good with everything turned up for being as old as it is. Infinity Ward just needs to make something that will beat COD 4 and they haven't, they have been a major disappointment after COD 4.  This game would run better if it utilized all the resources it needs. Those resources I have: Intel Core i7-3770 32Gb of Memory 3 x Geforce GTX 770s  The next Call of Duty game is not going to be worth getting, unless someone else can make it look 100x better than what Infinity Ward can.  Infinity Ward in general should just retire making the Call of Duty series, and hand the rights over to a different company."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TBH I'm quite disappointed with this game as far as the online multiplayer goes! (not tried the campain yet) Every time I play there is a hacker with a aimbot or wallhack spoiling it for everyone. As far as I can tell there doesn't seem to be anything been done about it!   Now the bugs in the graphics, sometimes randomly after picking up an enemyâ€™s gun the whole screen flickers black (basically totally blind) and also randomly my gun will start to grow random black spikes around my barrel!! WTF!  I was going to buy the hardened edition which comes with the season pass included but decided to get the season pass a bit later after playing and learning the standard maps first. I'm glad I chose that option now!!!  BOTTOM LINE... FIX THE BUGS AND STOP THE HACKERS! Then I will buy the season pass! As for recommending this game, probably not.. well not yet!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,like call of duty II to many Hackers AND cheters sorry I was A big fan of call of duty not any more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is only good if PC is boss
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"POORT COD GAME REALLY BAD ..   COD HAS GONE DOWN HILL , I HATED BO2 BUT JEEZE ITS BETTER THAN THIS CRAP......  BF4 AND CANT WAIT FOR TITAN FALL"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,don't buy this its a waste of money for the PC you get ton of crashes lag and more..........
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fx6300 6core 2x8gb 1333 team elite ram msi gtx 760 2gb  lag above medium settings...............(bad optimized) even with graphics set to ultra. it looks very out dated.  no dedicated servers. so no vac bans for hackers.....  evey game has someone on god mode.  complete waste of money  infinity ward really have shown they only care about people with the new consoles.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i call play the game it say content package is no longer available
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game. It's a dreadful, DREADFUL, PC port. It runs like cancer. It looks like crap.  It's a shame as the weapon sounds are go and it plays okay, bur frankly Quake Like looks and runs better than this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many haxxors not being caught/dealt with appropriately.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, not that fun, worst call of duty game out there probably. dissapointed i honestly bought it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is like modern warfare 2's older brother. the specifications are way above what it should be and yes the game will give you some laggspike even when you got a beast pc. you need 8gb of ram, there's no FOV meter so you will get a headache in a few minutes and you need 64 bit windows or else it wont run the game (like it did with me) game is no the best they made but the story mode is pretty good. multiplayer is just as fun in modern warfare 2 or 3 only with a few more gamemodes.  4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"UPDATE: The 'f'-ing scene was fixed in a patch last week. It is still not a great game, but at least it is playable now.  I thought this game was OK.... until I got to the 'f'-ing scene in the Sin City single player mission where you mash 'f' to live."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This review is based on the multiplayer since thats all anyone cares about. All i want to say is this game is horribly optimized on PC, if you want this game id say get it for console. Frame rate is terrible (its not my computer), has in game mouse acceleration that you can't turn off in game, using an xbox 360 controller feels very wonky. Basically what im trying to say is that this game is unplayable and it does not seem like the developers give two â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to fix their game. i paid full price and i honestly regret it, wish i could get a refund. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't let my amount of MP hours fool you (70 odd,a good chunk of that just trying to join a game). I've always enjoyed playing COD on console,and this is the first version I've bought on PC...massive fail!  I didn't mind the campaign,it was short (roughly 5 hours as you can see),but kept me entertained the whole time and ran pretty good. Not worth the RRP though.  Multiplayer on the other hand has had issues since the very beginning,and their so called fixes never seem to make a difference. They rarely update changelog (probably because theres no improvements),they'd much rather just cram ridiculous DLC skins and crap down your throat constantly. Stuttering,frame drops and just an all over ugly and unenjoyable experience. I am comfortable with KBM and controller,but neither feels right in this game. They may have fixed the performance issues in the new update,but I'd almost put money on they haven't  To make matters worse,I purchased the season pass as it was a pre-order special and have found them worthwhile in the past. Since the release of the first DLC I've been able to join about 2 games in the 1st DLC,5 in the 2nd and none in the 3rd. Extinction wise,only 3 games I've been able to join...all laggy as hell! Hardly anyone plays the MP,I can't even get into a game for the base multiplayer anymore (I live close to the Melbourne CBD and don't have problems with any other game).  I don't normally leave negative reviews,but had to share my experience to save other people out there from wasting their money and supporting something that doesn't deserve it. I'm also only just posting this now as I thought I would give them a decent amount of time to fix this game,but it appears it never will be. It's not like It has any potential anyway.   Overall,massive waste of money. I haven't tried the console version of this,but it has to be better and more populated than this piece of crap. Save your coin and buy something else,and If it has to be COD,any of the previous releases."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ guns kill to quick and boaring 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Got 360 qucikscoped and spawn camped constantly, same game 3/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Well the New wolf Skin DLC is not working oh grate well done  Not getting any more dlcs from you
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No. Dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money on this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Spawns, cheaters, no dedicated servers, lame maps - this will be the last CoD game for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If it wern't for the cheaters and the lack of anti cheat support from Activision and Infinit Ward, this would be a pretty good game. As long as you don't mind frame rate drops, lag issues, lack of server choices and just a screw you attitude from the developers, then I could recommend this game other wise I have to say NO WAY should anyone buy this game. I think a large lawsuit is needed"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As a longtime player of MW games and online PC gaming (1999) this game is was poorly developed with little support. Multiplayer issues: 1) F2 button does not work or works randomly. 2) ESC/Back button works randomly on certain pages or not at all. 3) Unable to a create clan account. 4) Voice options has a LOCK on adjusting the pickup  threshold...wth...why?  These are just some of the issues, but the lack of support to fix this game is inexcusable and I will not be purchasing any further IW products nor recommending any till I see change."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have been a call of duty Fan since Call of Duty 3 so...a long time now and when I say this, I mean it, THIS IS THE WORST CALL OF DUTY OF ALL TIME, I wasted my hard earned money of Â£40 on this waste of time, its not even optimized for pc and can't even be played properly. Whats the point in releasing a game that can't even be played on high end Pc's?! I wish I had bought this game on console so I could return the game and get my money back. This call of duty was the last attempt to keep the franchise alive, I thought Black Ops 2 was pretty good since the horrendous game of MW3 put me off Call of Duty, but thats it now CALL OF DUTY IS DEAD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just save your money and play Blakc Ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Personaly black ops 2 was better.. Hopping Advanced Warfare is better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Because im a bloody fool i bought this game, it was so terrible, and it crashed so many times that i went to my german shepherd and had her rip my arms off so that i learn my lesson to never buy a cod game again. I then asked her to maul my face which sent me into a spiraling coma where i was hospitalized for 1 year, i have fianlly returned home from the hospital and the first thing im going to do is write this review. As of right now you can pre order the new call of duty game, if you do that, you will be making the worst mistake of your life...if you buy any more COD games, you will dishonor your family name and their legacy, if your family is full of crack heads and you think you cant really dishonor their legacy, trust me yes you can, thats how bad COD games are. Please dont buy anymore COD games, i read that the money they use to fund these games come from blood diamonds."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a game when at day one you want to retrun it if you want a some what good COD game go with Black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its Call Of Duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,go get titanfall better value for money and game experience 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No. Simply not. No! Campaign is gay, and the multiplayer is worse."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No words to explain how bad it's.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cannot review game because it crashes after the intro.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ every year
Call of Duty: Ghosts,' PURE GARBAGE '  Money wasted.  Never Again. Lesson Learned.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT BUY THIS GAME.... i love cod franchise and i own every cod there is to own but this a miserable cashgrab
Call of Duty: Ghosts,PC GAMERS UNITE AND BYCOOT THE FRANCISE THIS WILL BE THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WILL EVER GET A CHANGE!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER BUY ANOTHER C.O.D GAME AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game it laggs all the time my mouse is jumping and and and f* Activision and infini
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am no gamer but it only took me 18 hours to complete and that was not rushing by any means,unless you want another muliplayer its a waste of money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth it. It's like Skyrim with guns.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lousy game, lousy optimisation for PC.  3 words: Don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crap! Not enough places to climb,some but mostly teasers. Steam crashes all the time while playing,or momentary lagg. Not enough players to play game,significant wait time. Explotiers galore.There seems to be so many cheaters that this could be the reason for the lack of players. People complain but steam dosn't seem to do anything. I played CoD for a long time.I have a number of this franchises games.They are not what they use to be.Now they are bad.  This system will not last if they continue in this direction. I don't recommend the game,and I don't recommend steam."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Runs like they accidently ported it for Mac and not PC, Unplayable! tried to get a refund after 58mins of gameplay, steam denied the refund. last time i logged in only 1,400 people were online, there's more people playing Atari than this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not purchase this game unless you just want to play single, it is full of hackers that furiate you render you helpless. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Extinction leaderboards are full of 'hackers' or fake accounts. It's not real, therefore it's a pointless feature. COD Does not seem to even want to rectify this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't Waste your money for this suck!! So many Hacker and It's didn't support Crossfire Lag and Slutering !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst call of duty in years. it's not the game, it's how it runs. i have a perfectly good machine, one that runs BF at ultra settings above 70fps (1080p) but this game just struggles.   the graphics are terrible. the light shades are all fake and out of place. the physics are good, the feeling of the weapons and movements are good but the field of view is way too narrow with no option to change it. coming from BO2, im used to 100% FOV and it's annoying that it's limited.   And worst of all, the map and level design has not evolved in any way, shape or form to combat campers and spawn rapers, so it still has the same issues that all other COD games have had.  I only wish you could sell pc games like you can on consoles because i would not keep this piece of crap for a day longer. if you are looking for a fast pace action shooter, wait for Titanfall, this game, even at Â£20 sale price, is not worth it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Waste of money and SHOULD be the Death of this franchise!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't reccomend this game. I play MW3 pretty well and although the controls are the same, the feel is not. Ghosts is not fluid. If you like MW3, don't buy Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hackers are running rampant! Do somthing about it or I WILL NOT BUY another cod game! This is a good game but the hacker problem makes it very hard to recommend!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Other than the fact that i can;t play it due to all the crashes, it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst cod yet, but plays it anyway so i can say how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is...   1. Know cod is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  2. Buy it anyway  3. Hate on it  4. repeat the process"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have downloaded this game 5 times, it always takes forever to load, and when the game starts in the middle of the movie it stops running. No it is not my computer, it is the game. I have checked everything and all other games give me no problems, only this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"singleplayer is a mess and to me multiplayer looked, sounded and felt like mw3. I won't be buying the next cod game until its discounted hard"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. Banned for no reason. Whoop de â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in doo.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the only game I've ever regretted buying, and I spent $15 on Dino D-Day. Spend your money on something else like CS:GO or Insurgency. 0/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"91 FPS lock even for people with 120/144Hz screens, runs horribly..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolutely terrible game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,would be fun if the game wouldnt stop fps spiking every 5 second. terrible port.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The reason i stop to play Call of duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a game that I would recommend...  Bad graphics, tons of lags and impossible gameplay  Not recommending to buy the game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is yet again another Call of Duty game which I have been anticipating over the year of its release and when it has finaly been released, i have been dissapointed since then. Why? you may ask. These would be the reasons.  - The gameplay is very crooked/blocky and doesnt feel as smooth or flowy as it should be compared to the previous games in this sequal - The great fps lags I receive from this game has made it almost unplayable at times even after I have lowered the graphics settings and im pretty sure its not my computer's problems as I barely get many fps problems with every other games. - The atmosphere of the game just makes the game feel like its half done or just a random CoD game Infinity ward has created to fill in their Queue for the year's CoD. The game just doesnt feel like it has been worked upon as Infinity ward has said so, maybe due to bad capital allocation during it's production. - The single player is decent however it doesnt feel very indepth compared to its ancestors e.g. The Black Ops series  The game does look pretty good in terms of the game's visuals and how everything looks as well as the ability to interact with the map in multiplayer (which should have been included ages ago). To conclude, i would recommend other CoD games.  Ps. my hours are messed up dont look at it ;p"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful.Black ops 2 was great this game is awful, have to earn squad points for everything, the dogs are like homing missles. Terrible,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In the past I have enjoyed Call of Duty franchise until this one. Personnely I perfer just doing the single player pve content I don't care playing the pvp. With Ghost you can tell that they have decided two things that the pvp is more important to them and they've gone to their subscription model. $60 is not enough anymore for the full package of a game now they wish you to pay $50 dollars more to get the whole thing as they finnish it.Since its mostly just maps and goofy xtras like guns or what not I dont care for it. What angers me and others who have enjoyed the PVE in the past is this content for PVE is so short. You basically can get through the PVE in less than a days playing for an exp player, couple days for others. For $60 dollars thats a crime. As I and my friends have decided it's just not worth the money anymore. I may buy the next call of duty but it will be when its in the bargin bin for 20 bucks...maybe."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not recomended this game. Have problem with colors,depth of field and weapon. This game was overated ,after u play u dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on him."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its bad. its that simple.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst call of duty ever made! I rather play CoD 1 and 2 over and over instead of this!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this game, you'll be wasting your hard earned money. The way they connect players in multi player ruins the game! The game is almost allways laggy and there are hackers in almost every game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,GAME WOULD BE NICE IF U COULD BROWSE SEVER'S AND FIND CROUCH GAME'S I WOULD NOT ! RECOMMEND THIS GAME UNTIL THEY ADD THIS FEATURE!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I only have three words for this game: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"May I ask why my powerful PC can't handel this but can handel battlefield 4 on ultra and why DO I GET FRAME DROP WHEN I LOOK AT THE DOG?!?!?!?   The only good thing in this game is the story and extinction,And I didn't buy this game my friend bought it to me and I wish I can give him back his money becasue we both hated the game and stopped playing it after 4 hours.  AND PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT COD GOOD SO I CAN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You take some of the fun things to experience in the CoD franchise, remove it; create a game package the size of BF4 or Titanfall which delivers the graphics and gameplay experience rivaling the leading games of 2004 - and you get CoD: Ghosts. I bought into the pre-release hype and purchased copies for myself and a buddy. The day of the release, the reviews looked amazing; Ghosts had scored an aggregate of ~90%. From the minute I first launched the game (PC platform) the gameplay was terrible - the interface screens all stuttered (most online user reviews will point this out), even eight months later no smoothness is in sight. The spawns are designed to keep your deaths as high as possible. The guns are breathtakingly weak, put a silencer on them and you have cool looking backscratchers. Motion in this game is anything but smooth. The one thing that really bothers me is how the game reacts rigidly when you are turning corners, passing through doorways - you will run into and be blocked by these things, along with pebbles, boxes and anything that occupies space in the gameworld. This makes the game feel like a product from 2004 and earlier. How the game scored such rave reviews on day 1 is a mystery; luckily the true game reviews are in place now. Even 68% is an overestimmation. Poorly designed game - poor game engine for 2014 - poor support (they still haven't fixed most of these things for PC) - false advertisement. This was a robbery of loyal CoD fans. Do not waste your time and money with Ghosts. I have a bad feeling for the next game as well."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad port, poor performance."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has guns in it, and you shoot people with them real good... I love this game cause I buy the new one every 8 months... pee pee comes out when I hear there is new game like this one... cause I like boys!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bought this game paid way too much for a game that crashes every time I play it , waste of money ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Seriously the worst COD ever created. Hackers galore! Slow and buggy. Junk graphics. Metacritic gave it a 68? Still too damn high! I'd give it a 6!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Full of cheaters
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game... It is just... full of false advertising.  They promised dynamic worlds. Didn't happen. They promised dedicated servers. Didn't happen.  The game also has too high specs.  The game freezes for a few seconds and then goes on.  I definitely wish I could've gotten a refund.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm sure on any other system this game is decent. I greatly enjoyed its predecessors, and am a huge fan of the feel of these games, USUALLY. That being said, this game is almost unplayable for PC. I have a computer that far exceeds the minimum requirements for this game (Radeon 7990, FX-8350, 8GB Ram) and it is so choppy at any decent graphic settings that it is unbearable. I could barely let it slide in campaign mode, but in multiplayer it is a disaster. I was perplexed at first as to how the game could perform so poorly on my rig, but after reading other reviews and forums, I see that many people had the same issue. I do not recommend this game unless you are okay with playing it on settings so low that it could be confused with Wolfenstein 3D."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. On the one hand you have a multiplayer experience that's extremely addictive and time consuming, but on the other hand you have poor optimization, an average campaign and an overall 'dumbed down' experience when compared to the recent Black Ops II.  I don't know if the addictiveness of the multiplayer alone can warrant a purchase, especially at such a steep price tag...but when you consider how horrible it runs, even on high-end gaming desktops...well, you get the idea.  I'm not gonna recommend it, but I'm not saying it's a bad game. If it ever comes down in price or somebody buys it for you as a present, by all means, play the ever-living crap out of it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is broken and has many issues. It is unoptimized. Yes your PC is powerful enough to play this game, you don't need better hardware. You need better developers making games that you buy. This game is a joke. It really is. It is unplayable to certain extents. Often times I find guns and viewmodels glitching out, causing textures to stretch all over accross my screen making it impossible to see. This game has framerate locks that cannot be changed, and uses a massive amount of video RAM for who knows what reason. On top of all these problems, the devs are not fixing anything, and instead pushing a load of DLC into our faces, asking for more money. Please, do not buy this game. Do not support this kind of behaviour. InfinityWard needs to realize they cannot abuse their customers like this, and that if they are going to charge a whole $60 for a game, it needs to work, and be updated and fixed if it has issues. Look up internet reviews and video reviews of this game for PC. They all say the same as me. This game is not worth anyone's time. The multiplayer has maybe 2,000 people on at max. And half of them are in Team Deathmatch. You can't even try out the new gamemodes because nobody is playing them. You literally cannot find a match, because none exist for that gamemode.The campaign is short and boring, and doesnt make sense. It has bad voice acting, and terrible cheesy moments. All the characters in the game feel insignifigant and you don't even care about them. Everything about this game sucks. The devs suck, the gameplay sucks, the community sucks, the support sucks... it. Is. Terrible. Do not buy this game. DON'T BUY IT. An absolute waste of time and money. Even on console this game has serious issues. It just wasn't built well. You're better off sticking with Black Ops II."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"OK well I don't write reviews that often, but I have an urge to write this one. Call of Duty Ghost is complete and utter crap. Why call it 'Ghost', and now Modern Warfare 3.5 or 3.1.5. The multiplayer is chunky and the game runs like garbage. its filled with nothing but head glitchers and corner campers, who will wait for you (in one of the many choke points) to come around the corner and kill you. Thats not even the start.. Now the genius idea was to increase the damage so everybody dies faster. Good idea in retrospect but very poorly excecuted in this game, because if you mix the head glitchers with extra damage its damn near impossible to get them. I have come to the realization that Infinity Ward does not make a new and exciting game. They take past games they made ramp them up a little and call it a completely different thing. An example of this is after the success of Modern Warfare 2 'IW' tried to create a sequel, which felt like Modern Warfare 2.5 but 'IW' called Modern Warfare 3. Now 'IW' makes Ghosts but they should have called it 'Modern Warfare 3 and some filler'.   Closing this rant the last couple things I'm gonna say is  - I will NEVER be buying another Call of Duty game if it is made by Infinity Ward again. Giving me crap on a plate is one thing but don't put sprinkles on it and call it cake, in the end its still just crap.   - I feel that giving this game a Metascore of 68/100 is giving this game a huge round of applause. personally i wouldnt even have rated it more than 60 but thats out of my control."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only the story is nice, everything else is terrible."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This and all other cods after cod 4 suck. play dota. how are these games stillvfull price.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay first and foremost this is the first Call of Duty game I have bought with my own money and it is also the first I bought for PC even though I have the Modern Warfare series on Xbox 360. Anyway this game loads up a little slow on my rig and this is a new build (late 2013). It has all new parts and a new GPU and this game still sucks graphically because compared to Crysis 3, whch is older or Battlefield 4, this game looks nothing like the 'next gen' we should be seeing. Another issue is consistency, you can basically get the same look and better performance on medium settings versus ultra, it's really that bad.  Gameplay When you start the first mission in campaign it looks nice and it feels like a nomal shooter type game but after awhile you start to notice things about the game that shouldn't happen. I have audio cutting out during the loading screen on any setting the game has. It's not anything hardware related as all of my other games run fine on high to ultra settings and they give me decent framerates between 45 and 60 FPS. Some parts of missions also do not load at all so you are stuck and I tried to reinstall the game and that did not work at all so I just quit and load the game up again and the issue disappears. However my biggest issue with this game is that it crashes...a lot. When I first got it I had no crashes, a few issues with audio, but no full on crashes. I play this game fullscreen so when it crashes it just goes blank. I can access my taskbar and my Windows 8.1 start screen but I can't open any new windows on the desktop or kill it with the task manager forcing me to sign out and sign back in. I do no have to do this with any other game. I don't knwo if this game has an isssue with AMD GPU's or something because I use an AMD R9 270X and if there is a support issue let me know.  Overall: This game is great when it works and a real piece of s**t when if messes up. This game is not meant for PC in my opinion and I will not buy another Call of Duty for PC ever again.  SYSTEM: ASUS ROG MAXIMUS VI HERO INTEL i5-4670K CORSAIR VENGEANCE 16 GB DDR3 XFX AMD RADEON R9 270X 2 GB Windows 8.1 Pro"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst call of duty I've ever played, and I have played them all. Crappy framerate, crashes and always a lag problem. Play titanfall instead, it runs smooth as butter..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I playing this game but especially this game is realy realy horrible because it want to wonderful system , so you never pay this game , if you have good system, only be wonderful system."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no sever... cant get a game in Australia.... Do Not Recommend. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fix the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The PC version crashes during cutscenes. Lengthy process of downloading outdated Windows .DLLs and DX drivers just to get it to run. Until Neversoft patch the game to run on modern OSes without crashes it's impossible to effectively review, hence: not recommended.  Unforgiveable that almost 6 months after release the game has still not been patched to run without crashes.  Note: My hardware, OS and drivers all completely up-to-date. This isn't a hardware or native software issue, it's simply a matter of Neversoft poorly coding the game for compatibility with modern operating systems and drivers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Been playing this game fine up to the last patch about 3 days ago.. since then had nothing but problems and the game just will not load multiplayer.. all i get is a window come up saying 'Do you want this program from a unknown provider to make changed to your computer'... I contacted Activision Support several times and all they kept doing was ask for more information than sorting the problem out... Tried all the online fixes and was only able to fix the stuttering menus and the fps drops when aiming down sights. I Do Not Recommend this game until they do a complete overhaul on it to make it run better than it does now.. the game runs worse than if you was running crysis 2 on a old pentium 4 *I tried this it runs really crap' :(.. If you buy this game wait until they fix all the problems then start to play otherwise your experience will be a bad one from the moment you press play.. Not Recommended because of low fps on beasty computers and lack of support to help with fixes...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible game engine, not optimized for pc. Don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multiplayer mode always lag, returning to ops2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am not happy with the game as I am tired dealing with hackers and Steam doesn't seem to care. Try getting rid of a player called 'thaT g!rL' that has been reported a hundred times at least and they are still playing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,mwf 2 ok but this omg
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"buy it for the xbox 0ne, ps4, xbox 360, or the ps3, but DO NOT get it for the P.C.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I must say after playing all the games in this franchise I would have to say this has the worst story. The gameplay mechanics are sound but the story is soooo bad. Other than a bad story its more Call of Duty.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Still cant play the game smoothly, mouse problems even after fixes, Its worse than a bad console port"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where to begin? This game is garbage, complete and utter garbege, and not just on PC, on PS3, Xbox 360, PS4,AND Xbox One. Thos may be one of, if not, the WORST Call of Duty games. Though I don't think it's AS bad as Modern Warfare 2.. Morale of the story, DON'T BUY IT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Have never even gotten it to run. Says I have an 'unrecoverable DrectX error' . I've upgraded DirectX (already latest version) and gone through the incrediiablt lengthy download a second time to make no difference. I'd like to get my money back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unable to play this game! 1) game failed to close run in safe mode...... I have never managed to run this game! and 2) direct x 11 unrecoverable error.  Evenutally heard back from Steam have done everything required still having a problem. Why did I pay money for this game when I can't get it to work!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This Game is a Rage Simulation. Bugs,Lags,Freezes,Hackers,Unsharp Textures,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Perksystem,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Maps and more.   The Singleplayer is Okay..... but Wtf? How the Hell they can invade a Space Station in the beginning ?!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,didnt expect this game to be so laggy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazingly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  I thought it was impossible to release a game worse than no game at all.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer is non existent and when it is, it's filled with rage and crappy no skill kills. Story is decent and interesting. If you are looking for multiplayer, go buy Titanfall, you will be much more satisfied."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts pretty much sucks, worst one yet in the COD franchise.. Not to mention the laggy servers and cheats that play in them. Activision don't really give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, they are just happy to take your money. Bring on Sledgehammer - Advanced Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"At first I recommended this game because in theory it's what I was waiting for. Bigger maps etc. Now I do not.  No one plays it anymore because of it's epic failure with lag, lag compensation, and bad programming. At most you get 250 players Worldwide (that it shows you) and because no one plays you are constantly connected with players in other Countries. HORRIBLE LAG.  You will not have a good game unless you have 50mb download speeds or greater. Even if you start to do good the game lag compensates you and you and soon your bullets won't register etc. It's all wrong.   The only way it can be played anymore is with tons of camping, oh and there is LOTS. Worthless really.  Other things they should of done.   -Allow typing in game after match the whole time not just 2 seconds. -Longer time between matches to allow setting up classes instead of adding that time waiting in game and connecting. Don't these developers even play the game? -Games go by wayyyy too fast, should be longer game play. Stupid. Sometimes it feels as fast as 5 minutes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a BIG LETDOWN!!!!!! I never used to rage until i played an hour of this game. Those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t moments when u swear u hit them but it doesnt count as a kill. Just watch the kill cam and u will realize u killed em. DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS A WASTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I got bought this game around christmas and with an OK GRaphics card I was never able to play the game. The games PORT was ridiculously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. And only till now when I have upgraded to a standard up to date graphics card am i able to play on it. IF you dont have a beastly GPU dont buy this game.  P.S Im only completing my profile with this review

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is very similar to other COD games, but it is very buggy, to the point that I clearly feel ripped off paying for a game that is half baked, at best. It crashed my computer several times, had a horrible graphic glitch that made the game almost unplayable, and loading times were veeerrrryyyy loooonng - even installed on an SSD. I spent hours looking for a solution to the graphic issues only to find a lot of people in the same situation - no support from Activision or the developer. Definitely NOT recommended - DO NOT BUY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I loved all the COD games...until this one, I dont hate it but agree with the reviews about the FPS, serious drops, causes k/d ratio to be very low, most of the time I have to watch kill cam to see how i got killed and from where as there was nobody to be seen...the anti cheat is disappointing , almost every game i was in there was someone hacking, just randomy shooting and killing folks without even seeing them...there is a lot of work to be done on it....hopefully this isnt the bar at which others will be made...i would score 5/10...just not made for PC at all...graphics could be way better, lag, skipping even on single player...and I know it isnt my PC failing to keep up....far exceeds the minimum req and then some"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"infinity ward really fell off. worst multiplayer of any cod game and dont even get me started on the campaign. unfortunately; they're making a direct sequel. if you want to waste your money, then by all means buy this game. I gave it a fair shot and i'm sad to say my time was wasted. Horrible spawns, terrible team balancing, and most of all a terrible port to pc. of course IGN still gave it a good review but that's only because they ride the cod train's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like there's no tomorrow, and even then they had to admit it's pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. that tells you something. Of course people will still by it because activision has people hypnotized. If anything, save your money for the next treyarch game; at least then you'll still have zombies to play. Overall the most un-balanced cod game yet. it's like they REALLY didn't even try. don't beleive me? look at all of the negative reviews. But by all means, buy it anyways."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To Be Honest, i dont See why this MOFOS are still Selling this game for $60 Bucks like if someone is going to buy it, i bought it HALF PRice and i still REGRET that decision  This guys Pretend that a Game that only 3000-6000 persons play it dialy is a game worth of $60 i mean if i were this mofos i would at least sell the DLC for $1 to $5 so at least i recover come Cash LOL  DONT BUY IT, If you got a MONSTER PC to Run the Game Smoothly you can only play TEAM DEATH MATCH anyways the rest of the lobbys are 5 persons to 50, so it takes YEARS to find a match :(  And when you want to change the match lobby and you leave and start another match making you will ALWAYS get back into the Same MATCH LOBBY !!! LOOOL !! this SUCKS SO BAD !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same old over 10 year old formula.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD game, I'm sticking with Black Ops 2. Don't waste your money on this game! Too many hackers and problems joining games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity ward needs to go to a psych ward if they think their going to be able to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on PC gamers like this again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD game ever. Rehashing old, failed variants and trying new unoptimized options. Really wish I hadn't spent the money on it but unfortunately, as I did, I might as well. Could have been worth $15 but not the ridiculous full price. And with STILL no dedicated servers the matchmaking fiasco continues........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single Player is nothing to write home about  The multiplayer however is a totally different game ... a total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-up, the game lags even on high end systems, and was issued with a 6GB memory requirement even though needing less. The menus are abysmal, and the maps seem to be too large for some. I wont even mention the weapons or perks that make it possible to become virtually unkillable  If you love dying in multiplayer, then I seriously recommend this game, if however you actually want to play a game, don't play this one for at least 6 months. Hopefully by then it may be patched  The game already seems to attract the Aimbot and hackers its predecessors did, and coupled with both the screen and network lag issues seems to make this the game of the year to avoid  I personally have issues with this game on systems that can run COD:MW3, BF4, TF2 all perfectly OK.  The PC version seems to be a half-hearted port of the console version with none of the benefits"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Graphically this game's got some pretty FX here and there, but textures look almost worse than the last iteration of this series. The gameplay is the same ol' same ol' that the past 6 or so games have had... Not even remotely worth full price given it looks and plays more like an expansion pack (again) as opposed to a new game. If this is a 'new' game engine though, than it doesn't show at all.  Also, if this is the front line for the 'next gen' I feel bad for consolers.. this game looks horrid even maxed out...  Nothing really can bee said for the gameplay, its CoD.. thats all there is too it. Nothing new, everything old. Only things shaken up is the unlock system in MP where you 'purchase' unlocks now instead of working for them individually. I actually do like this method, as it levels the playing field far more than the ages old level grind to get the better gear. The full play time is UNDER 5 hours for the campaign, and thats according to my STEAM time WITH some time spent in MP. Meaning its closer to 3.5 or 4 hours since I only played several rounds.  The 'extinction' mode is just a cheesey co op vs aliens thing. Nothing really impressive, and the story isn't even presented, its just there. So you can jump in, and have NO idea whats going on.  Edit: apparently theres a bug thats infested the game as bad as one that Ubi patched into Ghost Recon FS some time ago. One that forces lower detail settings regardless of what your actually running. Looking around there is NO fix for this of yet, so my initial look stands as is."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,GAME WOULD BE NICE IF U COULD BROWSE SEVER'S AND FIND CROUCH GAME'S I WOULD NOT ! RECOMMEND THIS GAME UNTIL THEY ADD THIS FEATURE!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Call of Duty-series started out really good way back in the day; but as more and more people got into the games, the series became too popular and the game developers sloppy. Year after year these games have become more dull and ugly, up to the point where you can hardly distinguish the newest game from the oldest one.  'Ghosts' is hopefully the last bad game Infinity Ward releases, but something tells me they are not done.  Our hope lies now with Sledgehammer Games, because this latest installment before 'Advanced Warefare' is really bad.  + Very nice animated menus + Fast controls (sometimes)  - Very short game - Very bad graphics - Not optimized well for the PC - No FOV - No new ideas - Sloppy design  I can not recommend this to true CoD-fans. This is simply not what we want."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,buggy and pathetic... feels like just a console port
Call of Duty: Ghosts,poorly made dont waste your time or money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"don't buy it , IT'S A TRAP!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horribly short campaign mode. Horrible Multiplayer. Doesn't matter what your rig is, the game will play â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's a port (surprise) and a lot of the graphical settings aren't very optimized for the PC. It by no means should put a hefty load on even the lowest tier gaming rigs today but low fps is a real problem with this game and it absolutely shouldn't be. The feel of multiplayer seems jagged and nothing special. The maps are the same old stuff and boring."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible game. Feels like it is imcomplete and the lag is horrendous. I live in LA and i usually get like 80 - 110 ping on BO2 but on this I don't even know what my ping is. The guns feel like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and control terribly and the graphical issues are just too much. BO2 can run at about 80 - 100 FPS but here i run the game at about 20 -35 fps. THE GAME LOOKS LIKE THE SAME AS ALL THE OTHER ONES! If you really want to buy this buy it on tf2outpost for a lot less. Don't pay full price for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm lagging, the whole screen is blurred up, and nothing seems to fix it, but looking away from that, It's still pretty bad! If i were to set the price of this game, it would have been 5 euro. I have several indie games that i enjoyed more than this. 3/10 Dragons"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game has never worked since I've downloaded it. I've trield all kinds of fixes. It does not work.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is really bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if you like campers get this game........ campers just make ghost boring as f*ck
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game it laggs all the time my mouse is jumping and and and f* Activision and infini
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am no gamer but it only took me 18 hours to complete and that was not rushing by any means,unless you want another muliplayer its a waste of money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth it. It's like Skyrim with guns.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont bother with cod multi any more. one day someone will make a game that takes preventing hacking seriously ....yeah right rofl
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The latest installment of the notorious series, Call of Duty, has taken a new turn with IW announcing their new engine. Call of Duty: Ghosts is essentially an OK game for a Call of Duty title, however the lack of enthusiasm to fix the PC version has made me and MANY others quit the game. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU ANTICIPATE DISSAPPOINTMENT. This game is a piece of trash in both gameplay (balancing is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrendous) and now also engine wise. (the new engine is laughable.) There is nothing to CoD anymore, but back in the day, everyone could play it because of it's smooth iD-Engine."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not enough peeps playing the game anymore to warrant spending more money on the game....so over this greedy franchise....they stuffed it when they got greedy and stopped supporting pc gamers, especially killing of dedicated servers....dumb dumb dumb..... we got their company off the ground and made em millions when COD was purely a pc only game, and now they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on us for consolers.... I say get stuffed and go broke â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crap! Not enough places to climb,some but mostly teasers. Steam crashes all the time while playing,or momentary lagg. Not enough players to play game,significant wait time. Explotiers galore.There seems to be so many cheaters that this could be the reason for the lack of players. People complain but steam dosn't seem to do anything. I played CoD for a long time.I have a number of this franchises games.They are not what they use to be.Now they are bad.  This system will not last if they continue in this direction. I don't recommend the game,and I don't recommend steam."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crashes on startup. Can't get it to work. Wasted my money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If it could run at least through the opening sequence I might have a view. As it is I'd have to concur with most reviews that this game seems to be rubbish. Oh, and by the way, I have a high end Alienware gaming machine."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crap to the bone...really...i can now say that CALL OF DUTY ended ...pitty! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game taught me to not pre-order.  The game was an interesting showcase of futuristic weapons, however it was greatly weakened by shallow plot and horrible graphics in multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Still cant play the game smoothly, mouse problems even after fixes, Its worse than a bad console port"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unable to play this game! 1) game failed to close run in safe mode...... I have never managed to run this game! and 2) direct x 11 unrecoverable error.  Evenutally heard back from Steam have done everything required still having a problem. Why did I pay money for this game when I can't get it to work!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dissapointing. Series peaked with Modern Warfare 2. Its time to wipe the slate clean and start over.   Online experience is unbalanced and dissapointing. Who wants to play with enraged preteens that only run-n-gun with no strategy? I also dont buy into the campaign storyline. If they could have shot the train in the first place they should have. Revenge is not a compelling story. Finally, the game engine needs work -- there needs to be a better cover system, less lag, etc to make gameplay really improve. It hasnt changed for like 5 games now.   Matchmaking system is terrible. Most of the better game types dont have enough people playing, -- unless you have bought all the DLC.   I liked the dog though. Maybe the next one should just be a dude and his dog in a postapocalyptic wasteland. No heavy weapons. Just rifles and tactics.  Disclaimer: I do still play a fair amount. Need to get my money's worth! Just wish it was a lot better than this. It is still better than the majority of shooters ... but knowing I'm getting cheated on what should have been DLC for the last Modern Warfare .. that makes me upset."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crap game...always the same soup...aimbotter hackers, wallers, level hackers and many others... free in play.... I got a VAC ban without a rational reason... I don't hack...I just joined ONE time ( i can't choose any different!!! ) an unknown 'forced' server ( 1 kill = 10 or more levels ) for one game ( i left it as soon as i got the situation )...Game in decline from MW3...Don't buy this or any other in future...Battlefield battlefield battlefield even with some little bugs..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where to start? ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!   The game itself is fun, on console. The claimed 60fps rate is a lie, the game crashes every three seconds (so far haven't gotten to play more than three seconds at a time), and I'm more or less dissapointed with my choice to spend $60 on this.   Would I suggest this on PC as a gift? Maybe to someone I hate.   If I get it working right I'll change my review. As of right now this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  *UPDATE!* This game is worse than laggy, it is ouright unplayable with no updates or fixes in sight. Infinity Ward and Activision should be ashamed of themselves for selling out so badly as to realase this unfinished, unplayable, bloodorgy of lag. Even with over 7gb RAM, AMD A8-3500M processor, and Radeon HD graphics card ( a system I regularly play BF4, Skyrim, with graphics set on ultra and running multiple graphics mods by the way, COD4, and Blackops 2) this game is impossible to play. Un-freaking-acceptable. Untill you fix this game you should stop selling it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,First Call of Duty I did not enjoy playing... It's just terrible...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS CRAP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Have serious issues with getting the game started, keeps crashing and no fix patches released to fix it. Total shambles"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is were i think the cod seriers died this is the worst fps game i ever played they need to stick with treyarck they know how to make games i hope they make a black ops 3 or something better than this piece of crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So whats to say about a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? not much at all. If your looking for a good call of duty go back to World at War just please don't buy this game. It is unoptimized as hell with stuttering on every single part of the game. Textures don't pop in half the maps unless you are running at extra texture resolution setting.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is by far the worst FPS title i have played in years. Not only has COD not changed since MW4, it has been plauged by unbalanced gameplay. Getting knifed shortly after shooting multiple shots into your opponents chest is getting quite old. problems that surround COD games are issues that have been in place since the beginning. COD is a genuine cash cow that i will not support any longer. Sad, but i must move on."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if your PC can't handle Battlefield, it surely can't handle this. the map sizes are far to over the top, with random clutter everywhere in most cases. the guns are decent with fun to be had and the perk system is great. however with the system requirements, map size, and the obvious Call of Duty logic and players, you would be better off buying a previous Call of Duty title such as MW3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PC Online is a joke, the free weekend picked up a few more people playing, but still 2,000 players makes the matchups suck, especially if someone has high ping or wall hacking etc, I would recommend Black ops 2 over Ghosts, feel cheated that they got my money so i still play it some. but Black ops is way better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not recomended this game. Have problem with colors,depth of field and weapon. This game was overated ,after u play u dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on him."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its bad. its that simple.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst call of duty ever made! I rather play CoD 1 and 2 over and over instead of this!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this game, you'll be wasting your hard earned money. The way they connect players in multi player ruins the game! The game is almost allways laggy and there are hackers in almost every game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Get Black Ops 2 instead. PC version is a stinker. PS4 version is better though and that is not a lie.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You take some of the fun things to experience in the CoD franchise, remove it; create a game package the size of BF4 or Titanfall which delivers the graphics and gameplay experience rivaling the leading games of 2004 - and you get CoD: Ghosts. I bought into the pre-release hype and purchased copies for myself and a buddy. The day of the release, the reviews looked amazing; Ghosts had scored an aggregate of ~90%. From the minute I first launched the game (PC platform) the gameplay was terrible - the interface screens all stuttered (most online user reviews will point this out), even eight months later no smoothness is in sight. The spawns are designed to keep your deaths as high as possible. The guns are breathtakingly weak, put a silencer on them and you have cool looking backscratchers. Motion in this game is anything but smooth. The one thing that really bothers me is how the game reacts rigidly when you are turning corners, passing through doorways - you will run into and be blocked by these things, along with pebbles, boxes and anything that occupies space in the gameworld. This makes the game feel like a product from 2004 and earlier. How the game scored such rave reviews on day 1 is a mystery; luckily the true game reviews are in place now. Even 68% is an overestimmation. Poorly designed game - poor game engine for 2014 - poor support (they still haven't fixed most of these things for PC) - false advertisement. This was a robbery of loyal CoD fans. Do not waste your time and money with Ghosts. I have a bad feeling for the next game as well."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. It has the same fast and responsive FPS action that Call of Duty is known for but lacks the uniqueness the series held. The gameplay becomes repetitive and boring. I could not even complete the Single player game because of this. Multiplayer maps are attrociously designed with plently of exploitable locations that allow campers to set up and farm score streaks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buy the game for Xbox, doesn't work well on PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a fan of the Call of Duty series and I do not recommend it, if you want this game just buy the Playstation/Xbox version. Reasons for not buying it: - Terrible performance on pc  - Few people playing/ its hard to find matches - you'll find a cheater in 75% of the matches you'll play.  Trust me, I won't buy a COD game anymore (for pc, obviously)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've played call of duty since mw2 and this is the first game that I actually couldn't stand. You can say all you want about previous call of duty's, but they had some good moments and all around they we're actually solid games. This one was awful though. The multiplayer almost seems designed to make you bad. Maps are open and unstructered so you're constantly being flanked and shot in the back with no room to prepare or plan for it, and even the simplest of begginers can pick up the game and do about average. If you're thinking about getting a call of duty game, get anything but this. CoD4 has a really great multiplayer and a large fanbase still."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TOO MANY HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU NEED TO CHECK EACH IP FOR CORRECT FILES BEFORE THEY JOIN THE SERVERS!!!! A SIMPLE CHECK WOULD STOP THE HACKERS!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so laggy. You disapoint me steam fix it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same old over 10 year old formula.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD game, I'm sticking with Black Ops 2. Don't waste your money on this game! Too many hackers and problems joining games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD game ever. Rehashing old, failed variants and trying new unoptimized options. Really wish I hadn't spent the money on it but unfortunately, as I did, I might as well. Could have been worth $15 but not the ridiculous full price. And with STILL no dedicated servers the matchmaking fiasco continues........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To Be Honest, i dont See why this MOFOS are still Selling this game for $60 Bucks like if someone is going to buy it, i bought it HALF PRice and i still REGRET that decision  This guys Pretend that a Game that only 3000-6000 persons play it dialy is a game worth of $60 i mean if i were this mofos i would at least sell the DLC for $1 to $5 so at least i recover come Cash LOL  DONT BUY IT, If you got a MONSTER PC to Run the Game Smoothly you can only play TEAM DEATH MATCH anyways the rest of the lobbys are 5 persons to 50, so it takes YEARS to find a match :(  And when you want to change the match lobby and you leave and start another match making you will ALWAYS get back into the Same MATCH LOBBY !!! LOOOL !! this SUCKS SO BAD !!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I loved all the COD games...until this one, I dont hate it but agree with the reviews about the FPS, serious drops, causes k/d ratio to be very low, most of the time I have to watch kill cam to see how i got killed and from where as there was nobody to be seen...the anti cheat is disappointing , almost every game i was in there was someone hacking, just randomy shooting and killing folks without even seeing them...there is a lot of work to be done on it....hopefully this isnt the bar at which others will be made...i would score 5/10...just not made for PC at all...graphics could be way better, lag, skipping even on single player...and I know it isnt my PC failing to keep up....far exceeds the minimum req and then some"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"infinity ward really fell off. worst multiplayer of any cod game and dont even get me started on the campaign. unfortunately; they're making a direct sequel. if you want to waste your money, then by all means buy this game. I gave it a fair shot and i'm sad to say my time was wasted. Horrible spawns, terrible team balancing, and most of all a terrible port to pc. of course IGN still gave it a good review but that's only because they ride the cod train's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like there's no tomorrow, and even then they had to admit it's pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. that tells you something. Of course people will still by it because activision has people hypnotized. If anything, save your money for the next treyarch game; at least then you'll still have zombies to play. Overall the most un-balanced cod game yet. it's like they REALLY didn't even try. don't beleive me? look at all of the negative reviews. But by all means, buy it anyways."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD has become a real dissapoint to me personally nowadays. I have played most of cods games even the ps2 versions of it and after trying out ghosts for a while.......it still the same thing. Personally ghosts has features which should have been included years ago like destructible environments. Everytime I play I think to myself, the graphics are nice and the weapons are new, but its still the same thing over and over! While I understand the core gameplay of the mechanics since that what drove me to enjoy it and become a fan of it since cod4 it just feels like its the same with new makeup everytime.  I mean cod4 had epic 64 player matches on dedi, and while I can understand people may prefer small maps with less people doesnt mean they should have remove this. Actually they should have expanded the idea from cod4 and even include these small if not intense battles with less players.   The multiplayer while interesting a bit with new weapons and maps just get tiring. I would have prefer they did a MW3 remake since I believe they could have done massively better on that.   Whether you want to play this game is up to you, personally seeing how COD i going the only reason Im still playing this is the campaign (which to me is entertaining) for both this game and future COD games and only when its on sale for a very cheap price.   I wish you all the best of luck."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign: Too short, but is the only next-gen thing about the game. 7/10 Multiplayer: Awful. 4/10 Squads: Very good, would be better if in another game. 8/10 Extinction: Okay. Either you like it or you don't. 6/10 Overall Innovation: The Create-A-Soldier and prestige system is my favorite of any game yet, but the rest of the game is 'meh'. 5/10 Graphics: I'm not a 'GRAPHICS ARE EVERYTHING RAWR' person, but seriosuly, couldn't be a LITTLE better? 5/10  AVERAGE SCORE: about 5.8/10  If it's on sale, money is no object, or you love CoD and have to get it, buy it. If not, then don't.  The first two DLC packs weren't great, but the last two were my fav. Either get the last two or, if you love Extinction, get the season pass.  P.S.  Oh yeah and BTW, it says I have 6 hours, that's for campaign. I have over 70 hours on Multiplayer, but it doesn't show that in the review because multiplayer pops up as a different game in Steam. If you have another modern CoD you probably know what I'm talking about."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same formula ripped off from previous Call of Duty games.  I hate the feature that u need to frag people in order to use ur killstreaks. Its painfull.  Not worth paying for.   This game should be free.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love Call of Duty Games, this one seems to end fast. Had it done the same day I got it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you have a console, no kidding go play it on that. The optimisation is crap. I can run BF3 in Ultra with a minimum of 60fps. This game runs at low, about 30fps and its god damn ugly. Online is stupid, campains alright, worth Â£10, thats it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gameplay experience is bad. Had latest hardware specs (Intel Core i7-4770K, EVGA GeForce GTX 780 SC) at time of game release and had to resort to minimal video settings just to be able to play, and experience was still not fluid and was laggy. Purchase of Ghosts did bring me back to better COD title like Black Ops, Black Ops 2, MW 2, and MW 3. Those are great games. 2 out of 5 stars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign storyline was a brilliant concept, it had really intensive and epic moments it was well worth the play. However, there are major stability issues, the game has lots of screen tearing, FPS drops, and major clunky moments. I would give this game a 6/10 final score. 4 points were subtracted for loads of stability issues, I would of subtracted more, but the storyline deserved something."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its just like all the other cods its blow the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of everyone and kill the leader i dont think much of multiplayer same as the rest plus hows idea was it to put aleins in it i though zombies was alot better i think activision has run out of ideas and just keep on repeating on it self
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call of Duty Ghosts I'm afraid is given the unfortunate position of being the game after Call of Duty Black Ops II and before Call of Duty Advanced Warfare that Activision had to release half baked to temporarily satisfy the annual craving. It offers very little improvements over Call of Duty Black Ops II and resembles more of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. The only significant new features was the 'Create a Soldier' and perk points feature in multiplayer. Otherwise it is the same copy and paste game as previous Call of Dutys. At this point I am unable to recommend this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I was quite dissapointed with Ghosts. The graphics were sub par and the multiplayer character selection proccess is an absolute nightmare. However the story line was entertaining and introduced some very unique concepts.   I will say that Extinction single handedly got my moneys worth out of this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolute garbage. Throw this game into a pit and set it on fire.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,69-911 too laggy and too many dlc!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty game ever. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Easily the worst in the series... 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. Wish i could trade my current copy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Broken game and Hack fest. Devs abandoned the player base and DID NOT address main problems. Don't spend money on this, even if they offering 90% off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same as the rest! Dear god make it stop, im a big COD fan but now cod is turning into the Apple network of games just pumping out the slightest of changes and calling it a whole new game. not to mention the over americanised â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ending where the bad guy is dead...wait no hes not...now he is....no hes not!!!....Now he deffo must be....OH WAIT!.... boo off no one survives that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, not even commando!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So after playing the game, I must say I enjoyed it, you know the developers tried to make a good game. They added camos call-outs wolves and many other things. What they failed to do was focus on optimization. On pc this game is aweful. It will crash 3 or 4 times before it decides to boot and once the game is started there is no saying how long you will play before it breaks again. Now before people go saying its my hardware, tell that to my 16gb of RAM and twin r9 270's. On top of that multiplayer is dead with only 700 players on at a good time and the campaign wasnt the best. Now the worst part of this game, They dont nerf semi auto snipers but they nerf bolt actions? you made it easier for someone to snipe...  All in all, not worth the money (I even got in on sale for 30$ still not worth it.)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this game. A bit dissapointing. The content has been done before, same story line. What bothers me most is how short the whole solo campaign is. Not worth 60 bucks. I guess maybe I've been spoiled from Assassin's Creed and just how much that series has to ofter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well, I wish i could actually hold an opinion on it...  Visually its very nice, 'if you have a beefy computer'  the story is an improvemnt on most cods yet gameplay it still tedious grunt killing with an array of similar weapons   my favorite part has to be when the game crashes towards the end of the campaign and you're never able to finish it, the games forums are full of people with this problem so Im not alone here... Come on, what are you waiting for? join us and stare at a blank screen after logging about 5 hours of gameplay..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The suckiest installment in the whole COD franchise. Multiplayer level designs are terrible. Graphics are not even closer to the next-gen all seems to be like 2007. **** CoD ghosts never gonna buy another of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ghosts is mostly just like all of the other Call of Duty's. A multiplayer kinda like all of the others and this time with a very short campaign. I don't think it's worth the money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dog game for girls and children
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst part of COD ever! Field of View, Sounds and Mouse settings need other programs to work almost as good as in older parts. Buggs are in every map, you can run over a big stone, but you have to climb over some fallen leaves!  Hackers and cheaters have a really beautiful playground for their little brain. Becouse nothing happens, they get more and more. I had the great experience to play with some of them, they had a K/D ratio of 10 and even higher, one was 200 ...  Most of my friends (and myself) won't buy another COD. Even if it is sometimes really fun to play, hackers ruin every fun.  And now that we all know, they won't do anything about it, nobody should buy Mappacks or anything else from COD anymore !!!  Thanks for some years of fun, ended in frustration ..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is okay. Pretty short, and some of the sections are completely redundant. However, as with every other Call of Duty since the original Modern Warfare, the game focuses more around the multiplayer aspect. While the multiplayer IS fun, there are a few reasons why I do NOT recommend it. First off, the game is full of hackers. I have some screenshots on my profile with evidence of hacking. One is of a killcam where the player has every perk in the game enabled. The other is a member who admits to using a name changer in order to mask his Steam username. I've sent these violations in to both Steam and Activision and neither want to do anything about it. The game is falling apart due to these hackers, and the developers don't want to do anything about it. They don't want to listen to the rest of the community. Also, they won't patch the game. Since day one there have been performance issues with the game that they simply will not patch. PC gamers are getting the cold shoulder by Activision. One of these issues is the flickering textures caused when running the game in SLI.   If you like CoD that much, try it out. Be warned, you may only be able to play TDM and Domination, because every other game mode is pretty much dead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,At first this game was great then i got windows 8.1 64 bit and after i got that the fps and lag was horrible so i quite the game till they can fix it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No Meta Score?? 'Cause it sucks! Single player is not very fun...too scripted. Multiplayer okay but not great. Pretty sad graphics for such large game files and high PC requirements. Ghosts definately keeps this franchise moving in the same direction; down.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Usually every CoD game the multiplayer is better than he campaign, but this one...the singleplayer is amazing, the multiplayer is horrible with frame drops, lag spikes, freezing, I have an awesome gaming laptop that has a geforce gtx 670mx in it, which is way above the minimal, lots of frame lag, singleplayer is fine though, I give this game a 5/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD GHOST on PC will be just that 'A GHOST' it will die due to a lack of care for the PC community.  I own all COD games and some have had there bugs but no were as bad as in GHOST.  It seems the more the engine gets used the more buggy the game is for COD PC how thay mange this with todays TEC is CRAZY for there PR.  It could be time to find a diffrent FPS , shame yes i would say so but the higher you are the higher you fall COD has had is final hard erned CASH from me and a lot of others.  DONT BIGHT THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dry story, multiplayer is dead"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worse CoD in years. Skip this one and play Advanced Warfare. 4/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Fail game. Always crash on my computer. No solution.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When I buy COD games it's mostly for the story. They're pretty good. This story was great yes but the online lacks. Giving it a negative review because most people are willing to buy just to play mindless hours of online. Get a better FPS online game to play, if you think this is the one that works you're probably wrong."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"(Note: Since posting, I've updated this review. See the lower paragraph.) This game is a worthless and unsupported pile of crap. Let me just say that I can run Black Ops II at maximum settings with absolutely no FPS dips or issues whatsoever. Ghosts, on the other hand, is a different story. Even on the lowest possible settings (where the game looks beyond awful, as if I had Vaseline smeared across my screen), I can barely keep it above 20 FPS, and sporadic dipping freqently pushes the FPS down into the single digits. Even tweaking the settings to the best you can for your system (which, even after being done, the game will probably still look terrible) is a nightmare. Every time you save a change in the graphics setting menu, even something as basic as switching between fullscreen and windowed mode, the game will have to reload the entire level. There is simply no excuse for such poor PC optimization. This game is an absolute insult to customers. Avoid at all costs. I bought this game on disc at BestBuy for $40, which is $20 less than the normal price as of now, and I paid about $39 too much. Do not waste your money on this.  UPDATE: (6/12/14)  I got around to playing this game again today, and I noticed that the framerate issues have been far improved (nowhere near perfect, but much, much, better). I don't know if there was an update of the game that I missed, or if the latest AMD graphics driver update fixed things, but whatever the case, the game runs a lot better than it did before. It's still not running as smooth as it should be, but it is much smoother than earlier, so at least now I can call it a playable PC game. I still wouldn't recommend paying the full price for it, but it might be worth picking up when/if it goes on super-sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Never agian am I going to buy another call of duty game.  Pros: Graphics Good for a 13 year old's first FPS  Cons: ::campaign was sub-par ::carppy mulitplayer ::match making is horrendous, took at least 10min to find a game till the host disconnects... ::they milked the hell out with all the DLC ::$60 price tag, it's never worth it for this serires anymore ::cludderd with underaged gamers and aim botters  $400 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars for the enitre COD seriers, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game alone is $60. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. if you had wasted your money on any of the DLC for these games I feel sorry for your wallet. This is the out come of compines trying to maximize profits and squeez the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of gamers by giving you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ expericane unless you buy and download all the DLC to be able to play the game as inented. Never agian am I purchasing a Call of Duty game. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst call of duty game ever. Hell i spent $600 to get a better graphics card just so i can play this game, not knowing that this game is the worst game i've ever played. This is worse than hello kitty.  God damn it, bring back treyarch!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's not CoD.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst Call of Duty game. I've enjoyed all the CoD games; some a great deal, but this one was truly awful."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crash on leavle 7 cant finsh playing i have 8 ram i shood not have to tewkt my pc cod goast
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A truly dismal offering from the Call of Duty franchise. I liked previous COD games for at least having some decent single player game experience. I tend not to finish a game particularly quickly compared to others - I take time to enjoy it. There just wasn't much there with this game. According to Steam, I beat the game in a ridiculous 6 hours, and unlike previous games in the series, it doesn't seem like there will be much replayability here. Too much of that game time was jumping in and out of cut scenes, spending a minute or two doing some trivial thing, and if you try to be a completionist and find hidden things, you have some NPC nagging you that there isn't any time for that. The plot was overly dramatic, and highly predictable. After the game is over, the challenges remaining are all co-op or multiplayer.  It isn't all bad. The space/underwater scenes were novel to actually be able to play in the environment, not just have a button to mash here and there to press a button or place explosives on something. Tanks were fun for the few minutes you got to use them. It just wasn't enough to redeem the rest of the game, though."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty ended with the end of the Modern Warfare series.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the worst call of duty game of all time
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why ummm cause i can not play multiplayer ... ^_- Servers not available this time ... what is wrong with your games nowadays I also have this on bop 2   I would 100% take a refund if i could.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a crappy game from infinity ward and others.Low FrameRate. Mouse and FPS Lag. Reload Frame repetition and many other crappy bugs. SP mode is better than MP mode as compared to for all sâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bugs.Really 'Infinity Ward' is that you guys been coding high or something got to you or else ?  Even BF4, which has alot better graphics, at max settings ran perrrrfect on these specs : i5-3570k @stock, 8GB Vengence 1600mhz @stock, Sapphire R9-280x Dual-x . And this game can't beleive it dude."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didn't have high expectations for this game as many of my friends said it was poor. I didn't buy it at first but then as it was on sale I thought I might as well. Well, at least I didn't get disappointed. The game actually is fairly poor I'm sorry to say. The AI on your teammates is sometimes so bad aswell. Sometimes you end up shooting nothing because enemies focus fire on you, and you die in 1-2 hits (1-2seconds.), which leaves you no time to shoot as you have to instantly crouch / prone back to cover. Sometimes you live 2seconds after a 'checkpoint' 10 times a row and it gets frustrating really quick. Sometimes they run in your line of fire, and on top of that, they give you really bad advices, and get you killed and what not, unlike in the other CoD games where they were actually useful. I also could not make out enemies from friendlies a lot of times!  The dog? I don't like dogs, and it was a major nuisance in the game. For couple of things, which I don't mention not to spoil even slightest. Guess it's hard to come up with new ideas that work anymore? I'm hoping Advanced Warfare will be better in this aspect, as there's more room for imagination.  The graphics and scenery were good, and I really enjoyed some scenes, but I had to play it on lowest sadly, as it was too laggy on even the normal, which is odd as my PC runs even BF4 smooth on normal graphics. Memory leak or bad code architecture? Or maybe it's made for consoles? Worked fine on lowest, but it ruined the good work done on scenery and graphics.   Now the story itself was okay, but nothing amazing. Basic CoD stuff. Multiplayer I won't even bother for lot of reasons, but I'm just bored of CoD MP for now. I also get the feeling that this game was pushed out without any testing. I'd recommend for the devs to play the game through, and see what needs to be fixed / changed. The new crouch-prone on 1 button was worth a try, but it's bad outcome. It doesn't work and gets you killed. Maybe it works better on MP.  65/100, poor for a CoD game, at least on PC. Put your money into something else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a game that is not very well made for the PC platform. It works just fine (for the most part) on consoles, but here in PC territory, this game does not deliver justice to Steam users with even incredible PC builds as this game is not very well optimized. I still had quite a bit of fun playing the multiplayer for a good 50 hours, but I don't think that I will go back this Call of Duty, at least any time soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I found single player to be decent, Multiplayer is filled with hackers so because of that i don't play this game :/"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Two hours of single player campaign on the first try. Mediocre multi-player at best. Absurd price for what you get. The CoD series is truely shameless.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The only good thing I can say is that the install button works, that's all..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"fREAKING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, IT WONT LOAD MY SPECS ARE ABOVE AVERAGE BEEN SCOURING THE FORUMS FOR FIXING AND THEY DONT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you haven't spent your money on this and planned on it... please don't. It's just another thrown together pile of garbage that all the COD fanboys consider 'good'. Not only is the single player mediocre as usual, but the multiplayer is completely infested with easily accessible public forms of hacks (Aimbots, Wallhacks, etc.). This is once again, another sixty bucks gone to waste."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Overall a good game but system requirements suck... they have improved upon reducing hackers in the game but still we can easily find one or two wallhackers aimbots etc. And also the host system in this game sucks.. if there isn't a good host available.. the game ends.. that's bad.. Finally the numbers of players are less... because of the reputation this game has of itself...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is probably some of the worst schlock Iâ€™ve ever played. Worst game ever. I thought my PC was terrible, until I realised how horribly this game has been optimised. Whenever I played campaign, the game would just randomly freeze every minute for 5 seconds. Have no clue why.   Would not recommend "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if i just would had a demo of this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to start with, so i didnt have to spend money on it. i am so disapionted in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ title.   Pros: good campain  cons:  multiplayer is so unbalanced and does not seem fair. singleplayer is also a big pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. and lets highlight the graphics..... they didnt even try to make it look good  i wish steam would let me get my money back from this crap, so i could go buy ANY other shooter! ....PLZ for the love of god DONT BUY THIS !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Recyled pish. Utter generic garbage spouted annually.  With the 'fish AI' and the 'dog' I figured 'Hey this one must be different!' But no it wasn't.  Sink 40 quid on they game. They want 40 more for the maps. Then they release dreadful 'voice packs' and hey THEY COST TOO!  Scripting and cheating have been rampant since release and the devs have done exactly NOTHING to address or remedy this.  0/10 avoid like the plague!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's just bad, it really is. If you are in for the Multiplayer and know what's coming, that's just fine. The Singleplayer Campaign is just garbage though. Absolutely no atmosphere, random generated story without any sense, the places where you go to are designed from 'Meh, well, that's ok' to 'Why? God, why?' It's not fun after all. I really regret buying this. The Singleplayer AND Multiplayer of Battlefield 4 are lightyears ahead of CoD: Ghosts, not to mention the graphics. This was the last Call of Duty I have ever bought. Such a shame when you think of the great first parts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,HACKS HACKS HACKS TO YOU WANT TO PLAY YHE PC GAME WITH PEPOLE WHO HACK GO AHEAD AND BUY IT IS NOT AVOID AT ALL COST
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Yes, its best game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game's pretty bad shapped, boring and just as stupid as it can be. Still looks like the game out from 2010, 10xworse than Crysis 3 GFX and runs 4xworse. Seem like a fall of IW. Well, it couldn't be worse, could it?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,GET BF4 laggy but way better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,really bad port to pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"single player is fine , but multiplayer is really poor , the worst iv'e ever played cartoony at best"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game in not Call of Duty the is complete crap don't even bother buying this game even if it $5 you'll just get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off. this is the kind of game that ruines it for us PC gamers it's solely for the crappy console's so do yourself a huge favor never ever buy this game i really wish i didn't   
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hackers and more hackers. Poor gameplay. An obvious re-hash of MW3 complete with lag and all the associated peer to peer nonsense. Poor quality, inefficient port from consoles that requires decent hardware to run mediocre graphics. Oh, by the way you do get one button you can activate on every map, one part of the environment that can be blown up, and a couple of things you can climb on. And did I mention the hackers? Total waste of money - if it was any other product you could sue for your money back. What a scam."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"B.u.ll.sh.it game. The worst MP ever. Lots of campers and also hackers.  - Buy a DLC pack , for no use . - People start leaving when AW came out  - Magically you will get stab by 12 year old knife ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DLC useless, refund?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After two playthroughs (separated by over a year), this game still suffers from horrible PC performance issues (i.e. extremely poor optimization). Granted Crunch's computer hardware is a bit dated, however even with the graphic settings as low as they can go, framerates would range from over 100fps to under 10fps in very short order. He experienced lag during supposed decent framerate periods and astonishingly mission load cut scenes. WTF?! And everytime he adjusted the graphics settings (in a frustrating and almost futile attempt to get a decent, reliable framerate) the game has to replay the mission cut scene with no option to skip. It appears little effort was put into making a decent PC port or into quality control. Crunch experienced nothing but aggravation trying to play this game (one of the few games that consistent frustrated him to the point of wanting to put his fist through something).  Even IF the story was extremely compelling and well-crafted (and there are plot-holes almost from the very start), Crunch cannot recommend this game on the continuing (and likely never to be fixed) performance issues. Crunch gives it a 4.0/10 and that is being generous.  NB Because of such poor game performance and no resolution from the developer/publisher, Crunch will NOT be purchasing or playing CoD games anymore. So, he has uninstalled all his CoD. If Activision either resolves gameplay issues or drastically improves the quality of published games on day 1, Crunch might change his mind. MIGHT! He will also be cautious about buying games from the same companies."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Give this game to someone who you hate so the trailer gets them excited for a terrible game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game stutters on my really nice gaming pc. It wont work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player unplayable... Try to make it through the campaign, if it's not crashing, it's lagging with such cruddyperformance, it's hardly even playable. And that is with a very new, very powerful, computer trying to figure out what the hell this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ load is that I've downloaded onto it...  Multiplayer unplayable... Just forget trying to connect to any server for any extended period of time, along with a miriad of other issues, along with those you find in single player. CoD Ghosts laughs at your feeble attempts to uninstall and reinstall the gross collection of gigabytes that is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pot, and despite any form of attempts to fix, related to firewalls, internet, drives, or whatever you may conjure as a justification for this breaking, this program (It does not deserve the title of game) will disappoint you so thoroughly, you will pray to Gaben, pray to RNJesus, pray to whatever gaming god you may have... but you will remain alone, with a lighter wallet and a heavier soul...  There is nothing that justifies this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It does not matter what content it has, with this many wide spread issues across so many cases of attempting to use this program, it's simply ... just wow... I'm done, I can't even rant anymore here, okay yeah. Bye. I'm going to go play Minesweeper, it's superior to this ... whatever...  0/10 unplayable"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game has horable graphics but story is not that bad .A god dam potato can run this game but it wont start without 6 GB of RAM .I really like song called survival by Eminem which they used in game .I think that game is waste of many just go and have a great dinner for this money .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Just another poor installment into the COD franchise. Teenagers will continue to buy and L33tF4gs will continue to hate. I personally enjoy COD but saw no significant changes between Ghosts and MW3, not worth the buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i don't buy other COD again, this game is sucks..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why bother buying this game. Hardly anybody plays on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"and again , worse than ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"18.9 hours of tweaking the graphics and trying to play the worst running PC game ever.   ...Still love CoD, just not this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Biggest pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, Keeps crashing on same mission at the same time, Terrible with SLI, Highly unoptimised. Good thing I only payed half price for this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this game, it's just a broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... Keeps on crashing and still no fix after 9 months... Just don't buy this game just don't. Also the graphics sucks and the campaign is boring and the overall game sucks but what makes it just HORRIBLE IS THE FACT THAT ITS BROKEN. If there was a way i could have got my money back I would have already done it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really was apprehensive buying this game since Infinity Ward had disappointed me with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. I bought this instead of Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag because I knew this game would last longer than that game. My thoughts? I honestly think this game is actually bad. The singleplayer may get a little boring and long so don't expect a good, 'story-time.' As for Multiplayer? It's surprisingly alright. I'm having fun playing this game (for now at least.) UPDATE: No. I have dropped this game and want my money back!   My only wishes is that this game (multiplayer) had more players. There simply isnt enough. This game in my opinion is well out of the $60 range. It should be $30 or $40. It simply just isn't worth $60. You're better off buying Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag for $60. But I think its a okay game. Would I recommend it? NO. Don't know, but it really does depend on the type of person you are. Happy Gaming!  UPDATE: Do not buy!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Biggest crap game of the whole COD francise ! Don't buy this crap !! Baddiest singel player that I ever played. The graphix looks like the game is from the late '90's. Multiplayer .. if you find a game , then you will run from it because of the scriptkiddies and low life marginals playing this game.   this game sucks snowballs simple"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game if it was offered at about $15. Pure garbage at any price above that.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fails to deliver. generic multiplayer map and load out. Nothing new here. Bought from microsoft shop for 15$ and still now worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Everybody who bought this should be giving a refund, worst cod game ever made and the last one ill ever buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You got to be kidding me, this game sucks... Recruit and keep getting killed on Odin Station...  Horrible sound and running on Windows 7-64 bit system  Waste of money...   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Might as well buy a second copy of the past 3 Call Of Duty(s) .....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pre-ordered with season pass and was really upset with the original outcome so waited to write my view till we saw at least half the dlc out. just got the second dlc and a big 3gig update....GREAT! willing to try it again seen as i have the dlc pass! seems like most kinks have been worked out but now the only major flaw is it feels like it should be played on a controller rather than mouse and keyboard (proper pc way). is this what the pc has to succome to as the 'STEAM MACHINES' come into our living room rather than at our desk??? still prefaring and thinking of buying black ops 2 season pass (just seemed more pc aimed and more fun)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lets be honest here this game is poorley optimized for pc, looking through your scope is an nightmare and try to play more than 10 munites before FPS dips, stutter, freezes this is not an game I will recomend to anyone with an pc if you have an console sure go for it but if you are an pc user like many just stay away, dont even bother.  Lets descus the hakers here now if infinity says they sorted the haking problem tell them they are talking rubish. I have come acros more haked lobbies than any thing els. Its an shame realy because of this ghost is nearley a ghost town.  Just do your self an favour and stay away. Buy this for your console and not for your pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The biggest disappointment this Year was defently this motherf***ing game the first week i had to look trough the different gamer forums to adjust my config_mp to run that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game properly with a i7 3,4GHz and a GTX660 and 16GB RAM installed with most of the Settings on low. Then the developers started not fixing the game, nooooooo they got that great idea making more money with people who supported them for years and made that wolf â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ skin what nobody needs instead of getting that game fixed. Its betrayal on all the supports of Call of Duty over the Years who made the developers rich fat and obviously dull. Thank u for that load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and single play just passes, this is the last activision game i am ever buying"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is possibly the worst cod ever, awfull netcode, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balancing and lame performances (it doesnt even play smooth with medium settings on a nvidia gtx680 with 4gb of video memory) ensure one of the most umiliating cod experience ever.. get back to blops2 or mw3 and dont bother with this crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game right now still alot of issues with the hackers, seem tobe getting a little better not sure way?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unoptimised Garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There's just something wrong with it, Theres hell alot of lag and crashes, I think it's the best to get it on console.Playing it on PC will just ruin it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts, Opinion based on single player story mode:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game screen almost blind and only gray color present NOT RECOMMENDED
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no this game is torture no dont buy it waste of money unless you like it then sorry it like getting a gun and putting to your head and then seeing black ops 2 next to you but you cannot play it just this hahahah
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well what can i say, this has to be the worst COD in the series! it just doesnt feel right, player movement is just god awful, so sluggish, weapon balancing is rubbish, and the graphics HA what a joke, and for the this to be a so called 'next gen' game, really doesnt look like it, even with everything cranked up high it still doesnt look like an improvement over COD:BO2. Oh nearly forgot about the weapons, or should i say lack of, Seriously 6 AR's 6 or so SMG's, 4 Shotguns etc etc. really struggling to see what is in the 28Gb download for this, must be the code for the AI fish and dog! But for the single player, story wise was ok. but it was the usual led by the hand scripted events blah blah blah, so again no improvement, well more of a step backwards. in regards to Treyarch giving you a choice in how you played the campaign.  So in summary, do not waste your money, i put off buying this steaming pile for as long as possible (only bought it cause it was in the steam sale).   Right where is the Uninstall this heap and refund button?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When COD eliminated the Co-op portion of the game it meant trouble. A multiplayer game of just running around killing each other is not what combat is all about. If you have been in combat then you would realize stratagy and stealth and team work is essential. Running around shooting in different maps is like an arcade game. COD 2 was acceptable and COD 3 was good, but anything else sucks. I am 69 years old, a veteran, and I play with many other vets and this is not the game to play. Oh sure you can play a multipleplayer privite match but all the modes are just running and runnnimg. I wonder what combat consultant said that is how combat really is?????? You guys need to realize that there are a lot of old vets and gamers that like to play and not just the young people."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money. IW sold out the PC gamers on this title. I was a COD fan for many years but the franchise has been slain by this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tier half finished unsupported pile of nonsense. Almost two months after release and it still can't run on my computer. EVERY other game of similar quality or higher specs runs like butter on my machine. This is clearly and unfinished half baked attempt to get con holiday shoppers into buying the next big TITLE in the COD series. The fact it doesn't work months after launch is just an insult. Wish I could get my money back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Six whole hours of gameplay? Wow... good thing I waited for a sale. I don't rush thourgh games, either... I explore every nook and cranny.  I guess if you're buying it for multiplayer it might be okay, but I haven't bothered to try it. Don't get it if you're a single player gamer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Have to buy a new system for this to work. Horrible programming.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing boring. The guns are awful, the maps are too big, and hackers all over the place."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well... What is there to say about COD on PC other than oit is dead? No one is on MP, COD sold out to console... If you havent bought it, dont bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dog Simulator 2014  Oh wait, its Call of Duty! Spend half the game controlling a dog who one shots guards, which takes 2 bullets to the head to kill them because â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ logic. Then spend the other half of the game carrying a dog getting shot by those guards, making your own teammates in danger to get it to an helicopter.  Die because you dont watch the right guy speaking.  Rampage through clueless soldiers with an helicopter nuking everything with a single right click.  Shoot soldiers through windows that doesn't break.  Break the game by sprinting in front of your team and staying at the place where they were supposed to go.  Same engine as Modern Warfare 2, nothing can be destroyed, looks like a playstation 1 game.  Would rather play Woodcutter Simulator 2013 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its as if infinity ward didnt try for the pc. I have a decent gaming setup ill show my specs at the bottom but anyway the campaign was practicaly unplayable and the Multiplayer was a bit better but i had to run at low textures to even run the game. I wish I could Get my money back, and here are my specs Core i5 4440, windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB Hard Drive, GTX 645 (its a real graphics card). I seen a guy play with the same specs but a GTX 555 and no lag what so ever but I guess its just the pc version Oh and my computer is an Alienware X51 R2 model"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its Cod, with a dog."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Short, buggy, and the worst character running I've ever experienced in a FPS (feels like a Benny Hill comedy skit when you run). This appears to be a dash for cash and a shameful end to an otherwise powerful series. Where is the narrative flow? It's the Michael Bay of video games. All flash, no substance."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a complete disgrace to gamers and the Call of Duty brand! Tons of problems and they have yet to even attempt to put out a fix for them...despite all the complaints. That shows their pure greed to make money instead of make a loyal fanbase. 100% dissatified with this game and the lack of professionalism with making it and fixing it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is quite good but the multiplayer is a bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst Call Of Duty game ever made. save your money if you are on the fence about making this purchase.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an insult to all the other COD releases. Graphic aberations, crashes......you name it. I have a decent level PC, all my other games work perfectly......except COD Ghost. I want my money back."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,good enough game but a game like this needs dedicated servers. online play is crap for that reason.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No anti cheat system whats so ever waste of time and money .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign was OK but not very different from other CODs. Had some annoying texture glitches but got through. I wouldnt recomend because it very similar to previous cods there isnt anything that new.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of duty is call of duty is call of duty...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dont do it man, get Battlefield 4 if you haven't already"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Extremely dissapointed. My computer specs are well within recommended range and it will not run the campaign unless I turn off shadows and lower a bunch of graphical settings. The game coding is pretty sloppy, and the visuals fall far behind what it claimed it would be. MW3 was aceptable, but this new bare skeleton of a storyline combined with an obvious lack of effort on the developer's part is starting to turn me off from the CoD series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I just bought both COD Ghost and Black ops 2 recently.. I have to say Ghost is in every way a downgrade from BO2 even though BO2 is a year older.. What a shame. If you don't have BO2 yet. Get that instead.. Wish I could return this game..  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Im rather disapointed! The graphic's are terrible.. Even on 'Extra' settings. Compared to BF4 this is really behind! Im sure its great on current gen consoles.. But not on PC!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please do not buy this. Waste of money, no anti-cheat support and only modes you'll get in is tdm and dom."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Removed features, very bland."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Get Battlefield 4 instead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game absolutley fails even on the highest settings it looks like trash and i have a gtx 780 superclocked which should be well more than this game needs but even on lower settings it still lags so bad if i could get a refund i would also unless you plan on using a 360 controller to play this game dont buy it the mouse accel sucks and you cant turn it off
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In general, just like any other Call of Duty game. For specifics, better mechanics/game-play compared to the other Call of Duty games. Slightly smoother game-play (in terms of movement transitioning), in my opinion. Hit-marker system that makes more sense compared to the others in the franchise. Multi-player match-making is terrible as time goes by. Each update, so far, has made the game worse and worse. Match-making system the same as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and 3 and Black Ops II. No ranked dedicated servers to be found at this time (12/30/13). And the amount of cheaters keeps growing and NOTHING is being done about them (fast enough if at all)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It is very apparent that this is a console port with little attention given to the PC community. I've spent almost all my time in multiplayer which is unfortunately becoming more and more un-playable by the day. Hackers are given free reign as there is no use of Valve Anti Cheat (VAC) or PB to stand up for legitimate players. Due to the lack of dedicated servers there is no guarenteed 'clean' place to play adn getting a lobby running without hackers is less and less likely as the days pass. There is an in-game report button but its not doing any good as with each passing day there are fewer and fewer legitimate players online. Do yourself a favor, save your money and put it into a game/developer that wants to provide a good place for people to play rather than a dollar driven hack-fest."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought this game a montha ago and i absolutely hate it.The mulriplayer is bad in the terms that it looks and fells like MW3,Matchmaking is worse that before and it laags like hell.Player customisation is good and single player is fine but the multiplayer portion is dissapointing.I always expect such disasters from IW and i regret buying it Dont buy it.Buy BO2 or BF4 instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So I thought who cares about the reviews saying there is lag and low framrate. 4930k 2x780Ti 16GB 2133 FPS~30 singleplayer and multiplayer as well as sttttttutteringg. Doesn't matter if it runs low or high quality graphics settings practically nonexistent framrate.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bug, crash, freeze, hack....  GG CoD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CAll of duty ghost was crap, I rather eat a card bord box filled with light bulbs then play this crap game ghost again. not joking this game was realy bad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lousy game, lousy optimisation for PC.  3 words: Don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,JUST REALISED THIS GAME FREAKING SUCKS ITS AN ABANATION TO THE SERIRES!!  I dont play many bad games and this is the worst game i have ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bought it on a lark f&amp;^% this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Turns out I hate these kind of games, were you're half in control and the games half in control. Then you do just what the game says and die and die and die. Half the time you don't know when things will work and when they won't. If I could sell it or give them back the game I would. -1 of 5 stars. Give me a real FPS or RPG not this hack mix. Give me Fry Cry, Borderlands, Crysis, and lots of others but not this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Get the designers from Mw2-Mw3 and make the next COD a Dedicated servers game none of this crappy euro hosting off a random player ingame. The crappy graphics in ghosts and the lagg all the time with the servers on any of your COD games makes it really suck. I see some of the programmers went to titanfall which I almost bought and returned lawl once I found out it was a 6v6 only and had like two game modes and really tiny maps. Graphics looked decent from tv aspect but once you looked at the game it was crap as usual.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Runs like they accidently ported it for Mac and not PC, Unplayable! tried to get a refund after 58mins of gameplay, steam denied the refund. last time i logged in only 1,400 people were online, there's more people playing Atari than this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To much lag
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst call of duty game till now.I highly recommend you not to buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game tke to much resources and the single player was totaly ignored. Strugle to get online most of the time
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"fps drops hackers, and no support from IW"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst optimized PC game I have ever played. I can run BF4 at max settings at 60+ fps but this PoS runs and looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Do yourself a favor and get BF4 if you want to play an fps.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the poor version of call of duty. Infinity ward sucks, rinse and repeat but this time they tried to rip off battlefield. I won't be buying another infinity ward CoD game, Treyarch are the innovators. I would not reccommend if you like fast paced action with a pick up and play arcade feel."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is awesome BUT... - You cant play it with the avrage computer - if you fall short of the ram required by a MB you cant launch the game without a hack. - with my old computer that was pretty beefed up (intel i5 core 8 gb ram) and i could'nt even see the activision logo animation without lagging - 60$ to pay  - i run the game fine on my computer but it has unnessary componetnts in it. -OVERALL: 4/10  My Rig  intel I7 4770k 3.5 Gh 16 GB high speed ram samsung ssd drive nVidia gxt 650 msi motherbord 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst call of duty to date.hackers you sure are free to come here and ruin everybodies day.I should have bought battlefield 4 and there is no way that i'm going to buy any expansion pack for this p.o.s. game.total waste of $120.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My pc Cover's the Recommended Spec's, yet it still fails often, i've played some parts 4/5 times just cos it locks up an i have to reset my pc to get back to desktop, an im not even 1/4 way in yet, if ya gonna buy wait till it's FREE or Â£2.99.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i m huge fan of call of duty games but this one ghost dispointed me becouse of lag . and hackers plzzz stop hackers they are spoining our games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The story line is so boring... omg....grinding thru it....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible, That is all I got to say"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's poo. And I'll have you know, I've played a lot of games, and this one positively ruined my day."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nope, not worth it still. Avoid"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"i should have gotten BF4 instead: in game: buy this, buy that: level up this: level up that, 'for each soldier, ' really'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont buy the game its not a good game if i could i whoud get my money back black ops 2 its a batter game and you dont need to have the best pc to play so dont buyyyyy it black ops looks batter and its more fun to play so if you want to buy it dont buy black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"NOT RECOMMENDED. Game runs horribly. I can run Battlefield 4 on ultra, but this game runs horribly on medium. Even ultra on this game looks mediocre, but I only get around 30 fps. On top of that, the game freezes for 10 seconds every so often until is crashes. Same feel as the rest of the games. I just want something different for once. At least a new engine. Come on..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If your looking to buy this for the multiplayer i wouldnt buy it its glitchy there constant lag and so far hacks are everywhere. Campagin is your standard CoD. Overall i regret buying this on the PC as i have always enjoyed CoD.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I haven't tried Multiplayer yet, but - while playable - there is still a fair amount of stuttering in single player. It doesn't seem to have to do with video card either, it just stutters. Less during game play than in the cut scenes though. The overall story is a bit too 'Merca for me, and then there are scenes that don't feel realistic at all. Like shooting guns under water and having to shoot ice with rockets. The dog is pretty impossible too. I spend too much time going WTF to be able to imerse myself into the game at all. The guns seem nice, so maybe multi player gameplay is fun? I don't know, I am too scared to even try because of the stutter. Maybe with some more patches it will improve. Either way, I feel like I made a huge mistake buying this game at only 33% off. Even Black Ops 2 was a major improvement over this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,RIP Call of Duty - worst ever in the franchise...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is crap worst cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i do not recommend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Words cannot describe how poor this game is... -Badly Optimized -Appauling Servers -Cheesey Campaign Although still weirdly addicting
Call of Duty: Ghosts,honestly i paid 60 bucks for this game and cant get passed 3rd level of story cuz it constantly crashes its full of bugs. it has a lackluste story with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest ending ever. the multiplayer is good if ur 1 of the lucky few it doesnt crash with mine crashes within 2 minutes of playing. MY RATING IS 3/10 THIS GAME SUX NVR AGAIN WILL BUY A COD FROM INFINITY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ FOR PC EVER AGAIN THEY STOLE MY MONEY THEY CAN GO SCREW THEMSELVES!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I don't know which I feel sorry for the most, the 7 hours I've spend playing this game or the 60$ I've spend buying it.  I still can't believe I actually bought it. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone, it looked more like an extraction from old titles (Modern Warface, Black Ops...), story sucked, multiplayer sucked, everything sucked and the graphics weren't that impressive."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't know if I'll buy the next COD unless the developers of Black ops series would be involved. I like this game in one hand but in another it is just too unstable..me and a friend want to go and play online but it's not stable, lagging, dropping FPS and for nothing. a game at first should be stablized and matched to the system (avarage one, not a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one) then you go and develope all these scramblled clan wars or whatever they did..looks like they got more intention on features of the game instead of how good will it run."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"lag fest.... that is all, also no FOV options dont purchase"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible, waist of money! Terrible optimization, frequent FPS drops, low quality textures."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What a pile of poo! Even months after release it's unplayable with FPS issues and horrible lag in multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the commercials for this game are great, the actual game however is the worst one yet in the franchise, poor matchmaking, no punkbuster and apparently no punishments for hacking (which is rampant). those 3 things make this game so frustrating that it's not worth 5 dolars let alone 50."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Like many people here I have been with the franchise since it began in 2003 but now I feel that the once great developer Infinity Ward (more like Infinitely Wasted) has let down the dedicated fan following with this iteration of the series if it can be called that.  When I started playing the game it had horrible fps drops which still exist and that's not acceptable for a PC port from such a developer. Not only are there frequent fps drops but they happen in the same places and this started to stink of poor optimization by the developers. Besides that, the texture quality is totally overrated for a 2013 game: it's nowhere near on par with the likes of Battlefield 4 (all problems with that game aside) where the graphics warranted the beefy system requirements, this game has high specifications but the graphics don't justify having them to begin with which I think is a waste and outright false advertising.  That being said I can't even find a way to display the game's fps...like as if the developers intentionally blocked it because they know their game is terrible.  What has annoyed me about this game the most is the story: while previous games have had some pretty outlandlish plot lines, the story in this game's singleplayer campaign is so stupid that it really didn't provide anything exciting...the Michael Bay explosion-fests are getting boring. What put the cherry on top was the ending - it was such a cheap move that it was practically screaming 'sequel'. Considering this story was written by a Hollywood screenwriter you'd think it would be something decent...but no, it's just dumbed down to allow for the stupid explosion-fests.  Is it worth getting this game? I don't think so. You may as well get Battlefield 4 or wait for Titanfall and have fun in those games than in COD: Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its very terrible. Why I say so, this is why. 1. I played so many multiplayer games, this is the only game that keeps giving me the connection time out when I am at my climax. 2. Many modes... wow. Great. When you select other modes, not 1 game available. People only play TDM. Seriously man, why just TDM have players. Efforts by game designer wasted. I prefer COD MW1 where there are fix servers to play. At least I know I can find people inside there.  I am not going to give any reviews about the weapons, each series there are different weapons, only thing I find it irritating is people run around with unlimited stamina and uses the a shotgun with rapid fire equip with silencer and kills people in TDM. No tactics, just random running and killing. I feel like this game is just like another Unreal Tournament.   The good part, is only the story. Good job on the single player I guess.  So in the end, this game I won't recommend to anyone. Its a waste of money. USD$50 plus for just the story mode? I rather watch youtube."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Infinity Ward is just getting lazy now. This game is not worth a full $60. Maxing out all the settings, the textures and graphics are still crappy in the single player campaign. If you are looking to play a bunch of Multiplayer, you better be using Nvidia's Geforce Experience to optimize it right, without the right optimization, you will either get 1 of 2 outcomes: 1) Really good graphics, and really low refresh rate, 2) Really bad graphics and really good refresh rate. Either or, both are going to produce Refresh Rate spikes, and drops which makes playing this game very unfavorable.  Even looking back on it Call of Duty 4 still looks pretty damn good with everything turned up for being as old as it is. Infinity Ward just needs to make something that will beat COD 4 and they haven't, they have been a major disappointment after COD 4.  This game would run better if it utilized all the resources it needs. Those resources I have: Intel Core i7-3770 32Gb of Memory 3 x Geforce GTX 770s  The next Call of Duty game is not going to be worth getting, unless someone else can make it look 100x better than what Infinity Ward can.  Infinity Ward in general should just retire making the Call of Duty series, and hand the rights over to a different company."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is great from a graphics standpoint, gameplay is good, not great, but the worst part is the number of people hacking on PC. It's unreal. I've been playing COD games for over 4 years online and I've never seen it this bad. People are actually bragging about hacking the game and saying they will never get caught. How is it that a multi-billion dollar corporation can let these scum ruin their brand? I don't understand it. I do know that I'm done buying these games. Activision can forget me spending any money on DLCs, add-ons, or anything else unless that put in a legitimate anti-cheat system to get rid of the wallers and botters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"personally i didnt like it i ill give it a 2 out of 6 rating just cus the maps are bigger and there is alot of empty space,u need a good computer to only run it and hope 2 not play it with lags and not all people have really good computers with 6-8 ram compare it with BlackOps2 and its like they took the game and threw it to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst... support.... ever... Don't even bother to buy this crap.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,had got this game and it still dose not work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its a game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Good story mode.but mp not so good(hackers etc).no dedicated server.not recomended.tis game sucks..stay away.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,an ok game deffenatly not as good as the rest off the franchise
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the first call of duty game that I bought and I was like what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! I dont like to hate on games but this put the call of duty name to shame. Finally call of duty always does a good job makeing their live trailers. Ghosts is the only one that sucked balls!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"absolute garbage dont get it no matter how cheap it is on sale for as i unfortunatly found out. but then again what was i expecting its a call of duty game for gods sake. if ur looking for a cod game get world at war, still the best one ive played to date"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game kinda sucks (OPINION) -singleplayer: pros:  you get to kill people and play with litle 'toys' for a bit (like an wifi controled canon with your tablet  decent grafics but low details  bugs are funny  run and shooty game, its fast paced but not to much cons:  repetitive  unskipable cutscenes  loadings  the 'toys' last for 1 mission  stupid AI  AI says 'lets do it stealthly' sudntly starts shooting to walls  bad explosions   0 destructible terrain  0 small details  easter eggs could be a bit bether  not many guns  regenerative health is too fast  expensive like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  has a moment where you flip from a person to another (could be well used but instead its just to have an excuse to you to use a choper  shortt  -multiplayer: pros:  fast  competitive  gay looking camos cons:  repetitive  new players will quit quickly  bad made maps   hard to detect enemys  campers  awfull community (racists and little raging boys)   so yyyyyeah think well before you buy it this game was a waist of money for me :c i bought it for 50% off.... and i want my money back. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this game unless you have a REALLY high end PC. Performance of the game sucks so much and the game looks very very bad on normal graphic settings. System requirements and game performence are not anywhere near in line.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game made me hate COD forever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What is there to recommend???
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The FPS drops and poor support/lack of dedicated servers make this purchase a waste of money. My system plays new games just fine but this game constantly lags and stutters in online play randomly. Not worth.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have sunk far too many hours into this pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but I will continue to play it. Why? Because it is a mindless FPS that requires little to no thought, just shoot anything that moves. That being said, I really enjoy playing extinction with people who rush through the game by placing the drill at the next hive as fast as they can and thereby â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing myself and my other team mates over.   0.1/10 would rather gouge my eyes out  only way I might truly enjoy this game is if I can get the snoop dogg voice pack  edit: voice pack aquired, this game is no longer â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it is now dogg â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campagin wise, this game is AMAZING. Best campgain I ever played in a call of duty. Its sad, and satifiying. Mutliplayer this game is trash. Nobody plays this game and it takes forever to find games. The maps are big and low count of players make this game really campy. Camp or get killed seems to be the moto in this game. I really want to like this game but I just can't. The alien mode is just a gimmick. For $60 waste of money. Get this game if its on $20 and you like playing story. Not worth it for everything else.Multiplayer community is bad too. Calling you out for hackers 24/7 Multiplayer=SUCKS Story:AMAZING Alien mode: Gimmick sucky "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"my specs are 2tb hd, quad core ic7, 16 gigs ram, 2 gig vid card 630 gt nvidia and i have to run this game on lowest settings and i still get fps drop to the point i get a still picture for like 2 secs and by time everything is ok again im dead. usualy happeneds when i zoom in with a scope or when im getting shot at. this is so rediculas its pethetic. i get better frams with battle field. seriously though, why all this grapgic lag. IW had plenty of time to fix this but not even so much as a release date to fix all this. 15% of the cod player use pc but if u think about it thats still alot of people. 15% is great enough of a percentage to keep up with some updates. step it up devs  edit*** surprise.. almost 4 months later (1/3 of a year) still no updates to fix this lag. wish refunding was available :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ok let me get one thing clear the game isn't horrible. The game is just dissapointing in so many ways. I will go into diffrent things in call of duty. Single player multiplayer squad team and alien horde mode. Singleplayer is nothing new there is a stupid plot about black country attacking america which now is almost only populated by white people huh. You know the routine find bad guys hideout kill him and kill black people on the way. But now there is a twist you can play as a dog :O but it almost dosen't matter because you can only play as the dog in 2 levels and after that its just hiding in helis. Yeah the games says its suppose to be about stealth but one of the first things you do is driving a burning fuc**** truck into a enemy base. So the singleplayer is just there so don't buy the game on console if you don't have xbox live or a internet connection. So multiplayer dear lord the multiplayer is just so so meh. Theres nothing really special about it other then you can call in a dog to help you and if you pay 2 dollars you can get a wolf skin to him. But its not worth it and it has no other animations so don't. squad mode is a game mode where you can team up with up to 3 other humans and fight it out 4 vs 4 players or 4 vs horde ai enemys. Alien horde mode is pretty cool the first 30 minutes after you find out its boring. So conclusion the game looks outdated and ugly singleplayer sucks multiplayer is nothing you haven't seen before squad mode is just team deathmatch with only 4 people and alien mode gets boring quick. But the game is at least working compared to battlefield 4 at launch so theres that.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I remeber bying the first CoD many moons ago and remembered it to be one of the greatest FPSs I have ever played. Hands down. The detail and love on every conceivable level that had been poured into the game from a relatively small, unknown studio was immense, all of it with the goal of making the MoH series look bad. It worked. Maybe a little too well.  From the original CoD to where we are now, the games have been gradually getting worse. There have been up points, WaW and MW2 had their moments, but aside from that it's been pretty crap. The CoD series has become a series of games to be aimed at people who don't play games. It is now a franchise for bros.  Too many ideas people saying 'lets do this!' 'what a good idea!' have killed CoD. Too much money has been poured into the franchise for CoD to be about being a decent game - nowadays you're just paying for the label - seriously - and Ghosts is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful.  -Graphics/lighting/models - Nothing special, in fact some times quite disappointing. Battefield 3 is prettier...and older, think about that.  -Gameplay - Nothing special. It's CoD, so pretty unimaginative. A couple of new features like controlling a dog. Huzzah...  -Sounds/Soundtrack/Voiceacting - Nothing special, save the voice acting. They managed to get genuine actors for a lot of the voices, including that awesome Colonel bloke from Avatar. Mint.  -Characters - Riley the Dog is by far the best. Everyone else is forgetable and terrible.  -Campaign/plot - It's like a bad Michael Bay movie. Sorry, I mean, it's like a Michael Bay movie. Lot's of explosions, people shouting 'OHMIGAWD!' 'RANGEEERS!' 'SHIIIIII-!' 'MARIIIINES!'. Plot wise, CoD was kind of losing the plot around MW2, going a little nuts with BO2, but in Ghosts they've gone completely off the reservation. It's laughably bad. All of it. And then you stop laughing. Because it's bad.  -Multiplayer - The new custom soldier features are quite cool and the money system is one I've always liked. Sadly, like all CoD games on PC the multiplayer is easily and frequently hacked by people who have just bought CoD to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ people off. The Infection mode? Nazi Zombies without the Nazis or zombies and so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ridiculous it's barely believable - then you remember that Ghosts was conceived by a four year old and all makes sense. Oh yeah, it's CoD, so every lobby will be filled with prepubescent tw@s.  All in all, Ghosts is decidedly average; nothing sepearting it from anything else except the CoD badge. Compare it to big name games that came out around the same time and it scores below average. Take that into consideration and then think about all the hype, all the promotions, all the money and all the people who worked on this game and their years of experience to give you the final product. Shameful.  Stood next to it's ancestors like CoD 1 and CoD 2, Ghosts is appalling - stood next to it's primary competitors like Battlefield (Both BF3 and BF4 with their fair share of problems), it is incomprehensibly bad for all the resources that it had while in development.   And then there was the initial 6GB RAM requirement for PC users...when the game uses 2GB at a push. Just bone idleness during the port process? Possible, or trying to mislead PC gamers into thinking that CoD Ghosts was pushing the envelope? Let's hope it's the former. But judging by the finished product I'm not sure the devs would be stupid enough to say that Ghosts pushes any envelopes. Not even a nudge - the envelopes remain stationary. Hah. Stationary.  And the to have the audacity - the bare faced cheekery to (still!) charge full price for this dry turd on a plate? Save your money. If you want to play a good CoD game, don't buy anything after the first Black Ops, they were really phoning it in by that time.  CoD is well past it's peak and needs a fall from grace. After that they might make a decent game again - like MoH managed to...until they messed it up again..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Didn't take long for the hackers to get around. Dedicated servers so they can be kicked from the server would be nice. I like the range of game modes. Don't play multiplayer much due to lag and hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cheat infested DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst cod ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when someone askes me to play this game I say 'Noooooooopppe.'
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This has to be the worst game Ive ever bought &amp; Ive bought some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Its worse than WarZ if that's even possible.   The game wont run properly on most systems. New Duke Nukem is better &amp; that is saying something.   Looks like a 80s throw back.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Simple as.  The game only takes 4ish hours to complete.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I find this game to be a HUGE step backwards from Black Ops II. I was a huge fan of Call of Duty4: Modern Warfare, I even liked MW3. There were a lot of things I thought IW got right in it's games, all of those things don't hold true with Ghosts. It's blatantly obvious that this game is not at ALL optimized for PC. Nothing about this game makes me want to play it. I will stick to playing BO2 or maybe buy Battlefield 4. I really regret buying this waste of a game, I refuse to even play it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game sucks so bad I had to uninstall the multiplayer because of the massive amounts of drop shotters, laginess, and how much this game demands out of your system. Then I uninstalled the campaign because at a certain point Riley wouldn't stop wimpering. The game isn't that challenging on Veteran but once the enemy starts to get some round into you you flinch hard and theres nothing you can do about it. The game is terrible and hopefully the developers just stop making CoD game (Likes thats going to happen) or go baack to CoD's old ways of WW2. You'd be an idiot to purchase this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is just a great disappointment. i have to admit that i did not expect an amazing game from infinity ward, but this is just not acceptable, bad graphics, bad meny options, bad physics, the list goes on and on and on. this game may be ok on the xbox 360 and ps3 but on the PC,xbox one and ps4 this (as i said) is unacceptable for one of the biggest game franchises out there at the moment. these guys invested alot of money into developing this game, where did these money go you may ask? well it is no good answer to that, but one thing is clear, that money definitely did not go into developing this game.  and the campaign in this game is just sad, i wanted to kill myself after a few hours of it. my opinion is: if you are not even going to bother to at least try to make a decent campaign, then do not do it.   the multiplayer is actually an upgrade from the last COD game in my opinion when it comes to the loadouts, but it is still kinda bad. i did not enjoy the multiplayer experience that much at all. you can just buy black ops 2 if you want a better game than this, it has a better multiplayer experience then ghosts and the campaign is also a little bit better. to sum up:  campaign: 1/5 multiplayer: 2/5 meny/ingame options: 1.5/5 graphics: 1/5  if this game is on a 90% percent sale, then you can consider if you want to buy it or not. (i would still say no, there is so many better FPS games out there)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same old guns, same old gameplay, same old AI. Black Ops was a big step up in terms of story, but Ghosts slides right back into the rut with it's derivative crap. Your attack dog, the most relatable character in the game, is kinda fun and useful; recognising this, the game soon takes it away from you. And the breaching charge scenes will often get you killed if you don't take out your enemies in the right order....and just as often send you back to the start of a long and boring narrative cutscene.  If you're looking for something new and reimagined - shadowy commandos striking swiftly and silently from the darkness in defense of a limping underdog nation, for example (as it was marketed) - don't bother. There's nothing new to see here. Move along."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What was I thinking?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The reason i stop to play Call of duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a game that I would recommend...  Bad graphics, tons of lags and impossible gameplay  Not recommending to buy the game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful.Black ops 2 was great this game is awful, have to earn squad points for everything, the dogs are like homing missles. Terrible,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible for PC, go buy Shadow Warrior."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,HORRIBLE ....... DONT $$$$ING BUT THIS PIECE OF $$$T FIRST OF U DOWNLOAD 50000000000000000000000000 GIGS OF $$$T AND THEN ITS LAGGY â™¥â™¥â™¥ $$$$ING $$$L PLUS WASTE OF 60 $$$$ING DOLLARS DONT BUY   HHHHHHOOOOOOOORRRRIIIIIIBBBBBLLLLLLEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is yet again another Call of Duty game which I have been anticipating over the year of its release and when it has finaly been released, i have been dissapointed since then. Why? you may ask. These would be the reasons.  - The gameplay is very crooked/blocky and doesnt feel as smooth or flowy as it should be compared to the previous games in this sequal - The great fps lags I receive from this game has made it almost unplayable at times even after I have lowered the graphics settings and im pretty sure its not my computer's problems as I barely get many fps problems with every other games. - The atmosphere of the game just makes the game feel like its half done or just a random CoD game Infinity ward has created to fill in their Queue for the year's CoD. The game just doesnt feel like it has been worked upon as Infinity ward has said so, maybe due to bad capital allocation during it's production. - The single player is decent however it doesnt feel very indepth compared to its ancestors e.g. The Black Ops series  The game does look pretty good in terms of the game's visuals and how everything looks as well as the ability to interact with the map in multiplayer (which should have been included ages ago). To conclude, i would recommend other CoD games.  Ps. my hours are messed up dont look at it ;p"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Spectacle Creep. Spectacle Creep. Spectacle Creep.         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Spectacle Creep - When Sequels Try Too Hard - Extra Credits&nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First, it's more of the same and it's broken at pc - did not optimized - worse gameplay compare to its predecessors - lame graphic with high system requirements. Overall, it's not worth for full $60 dollars with such lame game with just a few decent addition."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well this year infinityward messed it up. call of duty ghost is ok but its not good and it has the worst prestige the worst story ever!!!!! when I played the story it wasen't talking about ghost it was talking about some random family become ghost. but i play the game just to finish the prestige's but know i hop that on the next call of duty would be better. I would give it an  6/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always enjoyed COD regardless of how good the game itself is, I, like most people still find enjoyment in the game. But this game is by far the most boring COD yet. THe array of guns in this game is just like Black Ops 2 in the sense that they suck in my opinion. The optimization for PC was obviously made by a monkey on meth, because unless you have a GTX TITAN, with 64 gigs of RAM, and a i7 4770k (and even then it probably runs at 50 fps) then you are going to be getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor frames, unless you bump your graphical settings down to very low in which the game looks worse than the original COD. This has to be the least memorable COD to date. Maps aren't anything special, weak gun line up (everyone uses the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing M-Tar), extinction mode has little to no replay value as it only comes standard with 1 map, optimization was rushed out of the â™¥â™¥â™¥, graphics are the same if not worse than previous titles, and even more. I've always thought that all COD's are the same and that is very true, but this one is the same as others and possibly even worse. This game also probably has more micro-transactions and purchasable cosmetic camos, and skins then say TF2 (BUT TF2 IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FREE TO PLAY!!). Everytime before you go into the online portion of the game it tells you about another DLC that you can get and it seems like every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing day now you see new DLC. Half of the games content seems to run on DLC since they came out. 'Should I buy this game?' NO, not unless it's on sale (like it is now), or unless you are a die-hard COD fan, 'cause although I get enjoyment out of the multiplayer (regardless of how bad it is I still find it to be a little bit of fun) I wouldn't recommend this game for $60, considering this game is broken, lazy, boring, DLC infested, rince and repeat COD. 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Notch has the right to sue these devs for stealing his textures.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,poorly coded everyone sucks at the game so dont feel to good when kicking â™¥â™¥â™¥ have fun runnin the game on lowest graphics settings
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldn't play this game if Activision gave ME $60.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. Banned for no reason. Whoop de â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in doo.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the only game I've ever regretted buying, and I spent $15 on Dino D-Day. Spend your money on something else like CS:GO or Insurgency. 0/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst perfoming game I own. Not many players online and those that are camp hard.  Graphics circa 2007 and even the console version has performance issues.  The first call of duty in history to be 50% off within 6 months. What does that tell you?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a huge hackerfest compared to Black Ops 2 before it. I don't understand why IW insists on making it so horrible so that it really is a ghost town. I find games faster on Black Ops 2 than I do this because it's so dead. Thanks IW for killing the CoD franchise.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Appaling copy of Modern Warfare 3, literally feels the exact same. Defonitly reccommend not buying this game, you'll only be disapointed. Black Ops 2 I loved, this however, a completly different story. Appalling. Sort yourselves out Call Of Duty. Steer cleer of any Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Call Of Duty's only a waste of time and money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,FUBAR is a word that was created specifically for this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is good in singleplayer but in the multiplayer there are too many cheaters and it is too caotic to play well
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a patch on any of it's predecessors, don't bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, other day."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game sucks as there's way to many hackers..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the pure 'Money Machine' To put it directly. But that's not all, this game is so bad reduced with the graphics. My computer for 1830 $ can't even take this game i getting like '30' fps incredible bad!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy from steam. I have paid 50 dollars to buy this game and not only does it not work. I can't find out why it does not work. The game starts and the computer pops to my main screen and stays there. I can hear music of the game but cant see it on my screen. I have had a nightmare trying to figure out what is wrong with it and finally. I give up and just realize I wasted a bunch of money. Steam support is a joke and nearly impossible to navigate. You send an inquiry and nobody responds. If you want the game get an Xbox.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Specificaly Campaign and the mulitplayer sec Extinction gameplay is fun although not worth the premium pricetag alone.  Plus points: if your system can handlethe requirements are the graphics and the ability to practice with bots proves to be a reliable moment of fun.   Down fall and the crutch of the game for which we all want: Multiplayer  - Poor performance - Rife with hacked players ruining the experiance.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've never been able to play this game first because of requirements and second after buying a new computer due to lag this is a disgrace to all the cod games ever released. Nothing compares to mw2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of duty by far
Call of Duty: Ghosts,9/10 it's alright
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worse bugs than Battlefield 3.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Most horrible piece of BS ever to be released, we all admit stupidty for buying this crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player experience is ok, but as we all know the point of a CoD game is the multiplayer, and the multiplayer in this game was completely unplayable. Don't waste you money on this and if you still have hope, wait for the Advanced Warfare with this advice: Don't ever Pre-Order it! You may regret really bad"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Optimization is so bad that even on high-end rigs game still stutters. It had so much potential but Activison blew it off by rushing it's port to PC. Honestly i expected much better from Infinity Ward. Probably this game is one of the worst in the franchise.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even though literally every part about it sucks, I'd still play it just because... but it's so bad no one's online.  So basically it's unplayable unless you either want to wait an hour to find a match, or play the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game mode 24/7 with the same people. i am dissapoint. i reaaaaaaally want to like advanced warfare but i can't bring myself to pre order after this pos."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"All of the small positives are completely overshadowed by the countless negatives that this Call of Duty brings. It not only strays away from the map layout/designs that made the game extremely successful in the past, but has even tweaked gameplay mechanics to feel more 'realistic' &amp; 'tactical', when really it only makes for nothing but frustration. This is not Insurgency or Battlefield, it is the faster paced arcade FPS known as Call of Duty. Infinity Ward should learn to keep it that way."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"***WARNING conatains spoilers dont read unless you completed campaign*** part 2 has no spilers this game is terrible. at the first mission you were to lazy to change the scenes from mw2 and it looked exactly the same.then of course the first person to die like in all movies is black, Ajax was one of them,rascist.then you decide to make rorke immortal.Then Almagro was stupid enough to flood his own city and Almagro looks exactly like Al-assad from cod 4. And then you ripped off the dark night rises on the beginning of the hunted and elias kept asking rorke questions instead of killing him which is what he was supposed to do! Then Elias dies and he shouldve died in the sequal or a later part of the game then Riley is now usless and you ripped off battle feild 4 in all or nothing.Then this is what im disapointed at most of all, Rorke dosnt die after he drowns,get shots and well other things, so unrealistic. next time make rorke actually die instead of being to lazy to make up a new villain, then he drags away Logan into the same hole in the amazon.PART 2 Oh and multiplayer sucked as well.First of all the match making was terrible this game is full of russains and instead of zombies you had to put the crappy extincion and make crap up.In multiplayer theres laggers,hackers,trolls and spawn campers and to little hackers get banned and at least give us a ping chart.Dont buy this game unless your a russain or canadian that likes making people mad!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I did not love this game 1/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Is this game fun? Meh. The story line is good but the online is far to easy,  Would I recommend this? No. Definitly not worth Â£40 if this game was Â£20-25 then I would recommend"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Avoid this piece o'sh*te like Ebola!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,COD for PC is dead simple as that
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not really sure why i bought this, It is very poorly optomised and it looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥ compaired to other games, I actually enjoyed black ops 2 but I got no enjoyment out of this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It OWULD be a great game but they let teh HACKERS ruin it, never banning the clearly hacking players. Some would have 60+ and 1 death with all headshots but still play week after week. Then they rset players who dont hack...god wish we had dedicated servers we can police our own servers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible â€œMultiplayerâ€   Game appeared 5 minutes after starting. Allot of â€œNo matches foundâ€ and finally after it found a game and another loading time of 5 minutes, it gives me a Black Screen with a white Arrow?   This is my worst 60 euro spent everâ€¦  Also I have played this game two times in a free to play weekend multiplayer game with no strange things happening. However, after I bought the game it gives me only problems with starting up, starting a game leaving me only with a headache. When I asked for a refund they said I had played the game for over 32 hours (2 weekends 48 hours), and gave me this as a reason not to refund my money.   I would not recommend this game to anyone  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I gave this game a chance, and it spat right in my face. So many annoying things in the multiplayer; IED's, campers, and most notably horrible maps.  I'm not kidding when I think that Infinity Ward was on some hardcore drugs when they made this game. Trust me, bad maps with bad flow. Maps like Stone(d)haven, Prison Break, and Stormfront are downright atrocious. This is Call of Duty, a fast paced and fun arcade shooter. Why do you make these giant maps with no flow where you can literally be shot from anywhere and die so quickly you have no clue what happened? Who thought this was a good idea?  And of course we have Space Cats and Weed camo DLC. Seriously? Are you high? And then you have Snoop Dogg doing voice overs, so you can take this game even less seriously. It's like this game was so bad, even the developers gave up on it.  Now this review may just sound like a broken record (and it is), but I tell you the game is even more broken. And this isn't even an exhaustive list of grievances, this is just the beginning. Sledgehammer Games, please save us."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORSE GAME FOR THE MONEY, THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH 60 or even 30 which was the price i bought it for. NEVER GET THIS GAME UNLESS ITS UNDER 5 DOLLARS"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the worst COD version in history. Poor graphics and controls, bad designed maps. It doens't play smooth. You can almost even follow a bullet. You would have more fun with the previous releases."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this game EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not even worth it at half price. Call of Duty is still dead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst potato simulator ever I would not recomend if your looking for the product on how to become a succseful french fry 10/10 for the music
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game ever made my activision for the pc hands down! A multiplayer game with build in auto assist for the pc is the dumbest thing I have ever heard of. I paid 60 bucks for this game and I can't even play it because of everyone just locks onto me before i can even fire. The people that dont have cosnsole controllers don't even bother wasting your money. NOT buying from activision again because of this and I have been with the series since it started. I am SUPREMELY dissapointed.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well i have deleted my last review... and for damn good reason...  this game plays like crap!!!!  no matter what you play it on!!!  the graphics are terrible the game freezes unexpectedly for no reason....  everyone on this game seems to be pro's at it and finally  it takes anything and everything that was ever good about call of duty and flushes it down the toilet!!!  i only bought this for Â£20 and i want my money back!!!!   reccomend to anyone???? NO!!!!!!!  so the next call of duty will not be purchased sorry activision but you have dropped the ball i'll go play bf4 instead!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It was a good thing I found this game on clearance for 10 dollars. I knew this game wouldn't be that great because Black Ops 2 was starting to be unappealing, which a friend bought for me because he wanted me to play with him. I have always enjoyed the single player campaign more then multiplayer since I started playing the Call Of Duty series back in 2005 in the WWII setting, I've actually ended my Counter-Strike career and shut off my servers along with bringing some of my clan-mates with me to enjoy the COD games with the release of XBOX 360 in November of that year. Lately there has been much dissapointment in the development of the series, and the multiplayer action just doesn't feel the same as it used to, it has nothing to do with playing skills, or the skills of others, it's simply graphics and overall gameplay. I am speculating Advanced Warfare will be the end for COD, just not enough good development and technology breakthrough, the games just feel cheap, and the DLC's are getting out of hand. Look at what happened with CryTek, they made an awesome Crysis game, then came out with an ok sequel, then a crappy game rushed after that one. If the corporate COD gold diggers would come out with a game worthy of a PC upgrade rather then degrade a game so a 2005 spec computer can play it (ignore minimum requirements, game runs fine well under it), they will win my heart back, as well as many others. I want to feel that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ic eye candy again, no more of this pixelated garbage, we veteran gamers have computers more then capable of running way better games. Make me upgrade my PC!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So, where do I begin? Hmm...   Call of Duty: Ghosts is not the kind of Call of Duty everyone knows. For one thing, you can no longer make custom emblems. Another thing, it seems as though Infinity Ward ran out of budget to make suffecient anti-hack/anti-cheat systems, not even buy at least DECENT ones, so we have at least 3 hackers in a server. BO2 had hackers, but they were easily identifiable and reportable, but in Ghosts you can report all you want, but nothing will happen for a month if you are lucky. Also, the weapons are not very well balanced and a lot of good things Treyarch did in BO2 were ditched because Infinity Ward possibly decided that they could 'independently' make games. And, CoD: Advanced Warfare, is Infinity Ward... you broke the pattern rule of Treyarch, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Infinity Ward, so now Treyarch has the right to make 2 games without handing it over to Infinity Ward. Basically, Ghosts is the next generation of terrible games made in less than a year that are rushed. Don't buy it. Buy BO2 and play that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible in its self but on PC it is that much worse. They merely ported it over as quickly as possible and then forgot about it. None of the key bindings are any good and have to all be redone.   Filled with a bunch of DLC to squeeze every penny out of your wallet, another series killed by Activision's selfish greed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is sucked. I got it over christmas for 15$ so i didnt waste 60$ and of all the call of dutys this is the worst.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought that game for 60$ and that baoring has hell pls lower the price becuse it isn't woth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO not buy this SH8. it's not worth the money or the effort. lo player count on servers and campers in every corner.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was purchased in 2013 and will not and has not worked on my windows 8 pc, it is a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I once said this game is awesome... now I am wondering if I was drunk.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My god.. This is one of the WORST pc ports I have SEEN. Frame rate is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! This game runs silky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing smooth on the consoles, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the PC. Don't waste your time. Buy it for console. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this port of a game.."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has the best story of any CoD game I've ever played, but it is still Call of Duty and it sucks. The multiplayer is terrible, and the matchmaking system doesn't exist. I live on the east coast of the US and get put with people from japan. 3/10, bad game with a price that never drops."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is full of campers, noobtubers and other anoyinng stuff. The PC version is so bad. And in domination at least every 3 games someone gets a KEM from Care Package, WTF. I would recommend picking up another COD or play on console. Activision does nothing for the PC versions of COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD is a well done fps.... I rarely rage quit, if people are hacking, or I have a complete idiot on my team that keeps losing me games.... whatever, I can handle it. But what I can't take is the 'Lost Connection to Host' and getting kicked from a match, especially when I was doing quite well. I estimate that this happens to about 20% of matches I play. Its been so long since this game was released, and its still so crappy?!? And I know its not my internet. With games like these, it only takes one small bug to ruin the fun from it....."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No lets see here eh.... Texture quality in campaign: 0/10 cant see any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ see only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing matrix blue and white on the VERY FIRST MISSION Guns: 10/10 Beautiful see only in the first mission at space :v Should you buy it: -100/10 if they arent gonna fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing then so long COD :V I hope this help you guys a lot who is poor and save money to buy GOOD and PLAYABLE game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game was not properly configurated for computers. Cutscenes lag constantly and the the sound cuts in and out, so I am unable to listen to the story. I am running the game on a MSI G Series GT60 2OC-022US laptop, which exceeds the minimal and recommend requirements by a lot. I run the video settings on the highest setting and it tends to lag frequently. I switch all the video settings to low and the gameplay runs smoothly with some lag from time to time, but the cutscenes still lag terribly and the sound cuts in and out! The gameplay itself has a lot of problems as well, during an extinction match I planted the drill on the designated area and it would not allow me to switch back to my gun no matter what I tried to do and it showed I was still holding the drill. It stayed like that until I died, which ends the game. When I started playing the multiplayer it had problems connecting to the servers and I was at my friend house using his comcast internet, it would take forever to connect to the server. I tested the connection speed and the upload and download was perfectly fine. Therefore, the game servers are the issue. Sometimes the connection would just drop when I'm trying to connect in the game. The story, I think is just terrible, my expectations were that it would be better than the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series, boy was I wrong, (SPOILER ALERT!), the story was about how the confederation takes over most of the world and hijacks a giant space cannon that could obliterate the earth, then the confederation reverse engineers many of their own and you go and stop them in space. (END OF SPOILER!) The story was too easy to guess and just to plain and simple. The Modern Warfare series had a complex story of betrayal, trust and distrust between the characters. I cannot describe how good the Modern Warfare series, but it is a hundred times better that this crap. The only new features is that they added a few more of gamemodes that are not that fantastic and they kept the classics. That's it no other features! Which is very disappointing and they took out zombies ;(   Overall, the game was poorly configured for computers, even for the best of the best computers (Ex. the cutscene's sound cuts in and out and lags, no matter at what video setting). The game is very glitchy, especially during extinction mode. The Call of Duty servers are very slow most of the time and can drop connections while trying to connect. Story is total crap compared to the Modern Warfare series, when a game is made it should be better that the last one. Practically no new features were added. It seems like they just copyed the old game and slapped in a few new features and changed the look and story. Very disappointing. Not worth $60.   The gameplay was good (the shooting and killing part, not the story), but that was it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crap game too much lag in game play. Black Ops still a better game. Shame really instead of getting better it gets worse :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I WANT MY MONEY BACK PLEASE
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bad port, poor performance."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Disappointing at best. Game (single player) is half what previous Call of Duty series contains. Graphics are not as good, Too much of automatic sequences built into game instead of actual game play. Looks like it was rushed in production to make money. This game deserves a free DLC for people who purchased it at $60.00"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is by far the worst port I have ever experienced attempting to play on the PC. The framerate is all over the place, the graphics are simply uprezed textures from the console version with nearly no support for things like DX11. The campaign is boring, predictable, and the only CoD single-player that was so uninteresting I didn't even finish it. The multiplayer from what I was able to play was the same old song and dance as usual. The problem is, I was having some fun with it until the game decided to constantly crash from an extremely obnoxious memory leak crashing issue. I have an fx 8350 and 2 gtx 770s in sli, and this game lags and crashes more than extremely demanding next gen titles like BF4, Crysis 3, and the Witcher 2. It is horribly optimized and won't even launch unless the person playing has at least 6gb of RAM, which means anyone with an older, midrange, or laptop PC won't even be able to play the game. And they have the gall to not only relase DLC but buy out Nvidia to sponsor this peice of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. As a CoD fan for many years I can tell you that your money will be much better spent of Black Ops II, which is a great port and has the best campaign the series has seen in years. It is a much better game and you can run it on anything. CoD: Ghosts is one of the worst FPS games I've played and as a PC port it is a disaster. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game crashes my machine! W7 Pro 64 bit. Sabertooth 990 FX MB, AMD 8 core liquid cooled 4.7 Ghz CPU, 8 GB RAM, Seagate 480 GB SSD, Nvidia GeForce GTX 5870 Graphics card.  This should be more than enough to run this game. I think we need an update!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very choppy online, bad multi-player servers, hackers everywhere. Let the gamers manage the servers! That way we wont have to get ripped off and pay for your stupid map packs and we can also ban the obvious hackers instantly!!! The community is able to produce their own maps...you dont need to rip us off and charge the price of the original game for your 4 map packs! Last version of Call of Duty I ever buy and I played every other version ... they just get worse and worse!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game... It is just... full of false advertising.  They promised dynamic worlds. Didn't happen. They promised dedicated servers. Didn't happen.  The game also has too high specs.  The game freezes for a few seconds and then goes on.  I definitely wish I could've gotten a refund.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The biggest disappointment this Year was defently this motherf***ing game the first week i had to look trough the different gamer forums to adjust my config_mp to run that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game properly with a i7 3,4GHz and a GTX660 and 16GB RAM installed with most of the Settings on low. Then the developers started not fixing the game, nooooooo they got that great idea making more money with people who supported them for years and made that wolf â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ skin what nobody needs instead of getting that game fixed. Its betrayal on all the supports of Call of Duty over the Years who made the developers rich fat and obviously dull. Thank u for that load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is pretty good. Some decent visuals, and some moving moments.   That's about it.   It runs pretty rough on my rig. I work for a computer company. I use my rig to virtualize entire small business environments with ease. I can play pretty much any game, including BF4 on ultra settings. I have up-to-date drivers. Really, I would comfortably say I'm well above average in knowing how to configure a computer to run a video game. That being said, I know when something is poorly optimized. This game is not optimized for AMD hardware. If you have a higher-end intel chip, and a really decent graphics card, then you should be fine. This is dissapointing, as the game isn't all that impressive graphically, so it goes to show that the dev's simply aren't interested in providing a better experience across all platforms. AMD does everything I want it to at a fraction of the price, and the only time performance is poor, is in games where dev's won't take the time to better optimize their games for a wider range of hardware.   So, my experience will be vastly different than someone who can play the game without issues. When the game was performaning well, I found it to be underwhelming in almost all categories. I found myself going back to BF3, BFBC2, and Insurgency. If you can snag it on sale for 15 bucks, the campiagn may be worth it if you can get it to run properly."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No server policing makes the game no fun gotta get rid of the CHEATERS.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would recommend this game if they ACUTALLY did something about the hackers instead of letting them run free. Good game, but hackfest 2014."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't even get 12 players to start a match, yet Steam keeps trying to sell COD Ghost add-ons."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only pro about this game is that multiplayer lags less than Black ops 2 with all settings on low. NOTHING else is very good.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"game keeps crashing randomly, sometimes just stoppes responding but other times just crashes pc completly. dont waste your money like i did."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"No it sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i just wasted 60$ and cant even play it cause this game use 6 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gb of ram! This is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is possibly the worst cod ever, awfull netcode, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balancing and lame performances (it doesnt even play smooth with medium settings on a nvidia gtx680 with 4gb of video memory) ensure one of the most umiliating cod experience ever.. get back to blops2 or mw3 and dont bother with this crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't even look at the peice of crap.   The weapons aren't that grand, the multiplayer maps outright just suck in some cases. And all this is assuming the thing actually works and lets you log into their servers. (Oh but don't worry their website will assure you they're at def con 5 lol)  Thankfully I got it on sale, but all those GB are not worth keeping his kunk of crap on the ssd. Not even worth moving over to the secondary HDD. And whatevers around the bend im sure they're be spamming the tv can kiss my â™¥â™¥â™¥. Gotta be some other shooter out there with more reliability, .. maybe even real dedicated servers ha!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the worse Call of Duty games I have ever played.  Video performance is not even smooth, it's choppy, even on a high end computer. This game is totally not optmised for PC gameplay. Mouse movements are also having some issues, look is only smooth when you use an xbox remote, but you plays using the xbox remote on the PC anyways. Features such as FOV adjustment are just not there. You can change settings in the config files to make your gameplay more enjoyable, but are we, as consumers, even suppose to be messing with those stuff.  Multiplayer is terrible. Maps are designed badly, times where you can't find anyone to kill, and end up dead is more frequent. This game seems to be full of hackers in the multiplayer and reporting them doesn't really do anything. Just goes to show that the devs don't really care about PC. Campaign is awsome! However, that alone is not worth the 60 bucks you pay on this game. In the config files, the game is set to search for servers with high ping. This brings laggy gameplay due to internet connection and also you often search games with high ping.  Therefore, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. This game does not deserve the Call of Duty title."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Simply put, theres nothing new, or nothing worth a couple of dollars in this new episode of COD. Graphics are pretty much the same as before, game play pretty much identical. Sure new weaps, mods and methods, but not worth what they are asking for.   For those who think Single player was ok in this game, you guys never played the original CODs. This is probably the worse single player COD ever. Scripted like hell. Dialogue as if written by a 10 year old, literally. Your role/position in the single player is basically an assistant, you have no freedom on how to proceed with missions, you just follow step by step instructions from the Ai, literally step by step instructions, as if you were a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ put to save the world.   Not worth buying, maybe only if in bargin bins for $10. If you have BOps 1 or 2, keep playing them. If you have BF4, keep playing it.  If you are deciding between Ghost or BF4, choose BF4!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Worst COD EVER!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Did work at first, but not now..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really don't like the game but i am more of a counter strike person.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game if it was offered at about $15. Pure garbage at any price above that.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fails to deliver. generic multiplayer map and load out. Nothing new here. Bought from microsoft shop for 15$ and still now worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign was average and it had a confusing ending. While the multiplayer is terrible. This game has the worst multiplayer in the Call of Duty series. I do NOT recommend this game and I regret buying it. 2/10 in my opinion.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME I CANT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LOAD WITH THIS DIRECTX BS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fish AI, Dogs in your squad, Copy and Pasted Scenes From Previous Games?  What More Could You Possibly Ask For?  You won't ask for it, but what you will get is extreme regret for buying this piece of trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game falsly requires 6 gb of RAM or more when it only uses 2GB of RAM. When I play COD Black Ops 2 I have no lag or any issues that I can notice, but in this game, on even lower settings of all kinds, with 8GB of RAM, it runs at one frame a second, at best. This is is not optimized for PC and several years later Activision has not put out a patch to fix the game, so I cant even play this game that I'd spent $60 on. It's not Steam's fault, Activision has terrible customer service by not fixing this game. So unless you have a super good or expensive Alienware kind of gaming computer or better, stay away from this game, you will literally be throwing away your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty Ghosts is yet another title in an yearly cycle of COD games. Infinity ward this time have created a semi futuristic game with new graphics, and a more inovative muiltplayer. The customisation avaliable in muiltplayer is truely surpurb (best for a cod game yet) with new weapons, the ability to play as a girl for the first time, and brand new weapons never seen before. The maps are a true return to form for COD with larger maps allowing for more explorations, and the new dynamic features are also quite exciting. The campaign is average, but is still good if your a COD buff who plays the campaign before jumping into the muiltplayer. Extinction is an interesting change up, and although it will probably (most likely) never reach the heights of Zombies, it is a fun change up, with plenty of fun to be found in the single map that is currently being offered.   Rating: 4/10 :terrible pc port can go and rek itself"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,is the multiplayer alive?  is it lag free?  are spawn points on point? is it worth the buy           YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  &nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst game I've ever played in my life, just dont buy it!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Thank god I didn't buy it. was a gift. that person isn't with us now.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD EVER !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DONT GET THIS GAME JUST DONT DO IT TRUST ME Worst COD of all time barely anyone plays and its very poorly optimized. Dont.Buy.This.Game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pile of dirt!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"High end pc, can't even get 30 fps, even though I got 125+ on all previous titles.   0/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity ward and Activision wouldn't know what a game is if it where made for them.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Constant Freezes, every five to ten minutes of gameplay it freezes for 15 seconds. Seriously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Barely played 20 mins and already a buggy mess. An adundance of control issues, long loading times amongst others. Worst COD game ever made."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I liked the aliens, but thats it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is boring Multiplayer is garbage Extinction is mediocre Don't buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Got VAC banned for no reason can't play it anymore
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This one is so over the top I was annoyed with it. The friendly AI is good for yelling at you, and not much else. The cover system barely makes any sense. This will be the last call of duty game I ever purchase, even on sale like this one was."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game just plain sucks. save yuor money instead of wasting it. Get if for console instead. I honestly wish i could get my money back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The singleplayer was a big let down. sadly the multiplayer isn't as fun as blackops II. Something seriously went wrong with this game. And that's on top of performance issues. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in peece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ kill youself
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a mess. AVOID. COD has been going down hill for years and I will never buy another from this series after this travisty.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this has the worst game i have played in a while, black ops 2 looks better and is smoother, you need a titian to play it with playable fps and it still looks like crap, why didnt they use dx 11.2 i meant really windows 8 has been out for as long as you have been creating the game. BF4 has way better graphics and way higher fps which is funny because usally call of duty has higher fps and worse graphics than bf4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is most definetly worse then most of the older call of dutys and for the first 2 months i had this game it wouldnt even launch with crashing 2 seconds later. the frame rate dips up and down and the maps are trash along with most of the guns with just afew acceptions. 4 out of 10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The first COD game I ever pre-ordered. Also the last.  I really enjoyed Black Ops 2, it was the first game since COD4 that I actually played year round. But this? This is inexcusable. Excruciatingly terrible. Probably the worst COD game ever. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, even just to get my money's worth, but unfortunately that's impossible. This is COD at it's worst; a yearly cash grab without any redeeming qualities.  It's also worth noting that the only postive reviews for this game were posted by mistake, literally every review of this game on Steam is negative."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not enouph people play the mutiplayer, the only game mode you can join intatly is team death match, has the same amout of people on it that play MW2 and this game is fairly old. The maps are too small to snipe on, graphics are 2006 graphics, texturing is bad. The extention mode is meh, they were better off keeping zombies, squads or clans are almost non-existant, not a Squad type of game, kill streaks are cool. Feels like a game made in 2006."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I agree with almost all of the bad reviews out there. Additionally, the game hasen't even been out too long now and almost always half of the game types, with the exception of the hated TDM, are always empty. How on earth am I supposed to enjoy a game that I paid over $60.00 for if I can never play the game type I enjoy (S&amp;D). There are way too many options to choose from which dilutes the gameplay. This game sucks....don't waste your money.   Here's an idea for the next release, try re-inventing the game from scratch. As a pc gamer I would love to see a modern warfare game that plays like old school CODUO (and yes there is a very loyal fan base that keeps that one alive for more than 10 years for a reason...jeeps, tanks, etc.). Plain and simple and where it actually took talent to win. Oh but wait...that would involve more effort than just slapping a new skin on dated material. Unfortunetly, we all know that any real talent in producing this game has long left the franchise. It's sad.  You have truely lost my business at this point. I'm going to BF4!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very laggy and un optimized game IT HAS NOTHING NEW ........SERVERS R LAGGY AND THERE R NO SERVERVER BROWSER AS A RESULT IT TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES TO JOIN A GAME .......EXTINCTION REALLY SUCKS ////NOT WORTH 35$
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is hard to run for sum reason even tho i reach about mid way almost max requirements and it still lags on lowest settings and takes years to load
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game play is fun, however i have never had more technical problems with a game. I have an Exceptional computer and it does me no good in the wake of this games many issues."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The story was great but, it was really laggy on multiplayer everytime i see a player,or every 2 sec i lag as hek"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"50 gigs for a game that probably was planned to be released in 2006. Well, it costed a lot, so thats nice! But to be honest, how on earth does a 4 hour single-player storyline take 25 gigs? how? it does not make sanse to me, and I do not want that much space to be wasted on a 2006 game that was released in 2013. Some cool features though, they were groundbraking. At least they were in 2006. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game could have been good if it ran well on PC. Unfortunately with my i7 4770k and a toxic r9 280x I get micro stutters and lag. Game crashes and its very difficult to stream using OBS. This game hogs memory even when setting priority to low.   Graphics aren't bad on high settings obviously,  Kill streaks suck â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Otherwise it would have been a good game. If you really want to play call of duty, then just wait for Advanced Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really regret buying this game, I thought it would be better than Battlefield, I was dead wrong. FPS drops like craxy, on a decent card, GTX 760. (Plus the spawing in this game is god awful, youd think with as many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cod games they have under their belt, theyd have the spawing system worked out, but no, you can literally spawn in front of an enemy, get shot and die before you have a chance to react.) The textures are just horrid in this game as well, for as big of a game this is, its sad to see such poor work.  No one plays this game either, so even if you have it and want to play online, you can't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's just bad, it really is. If you are in for the Multiplayer and know what's coming, that's just fine. The Singleplayer Campaign is just garbage though. Absolutely no atmosphere, random generated story without any sense, the places where you go to are designed from 'Meh, well, that's ok' to 'Why? God, why?' It's not fun after all. I really regret buying this. The Singleplayer AND Multiplayer of Battlefield 4 are lightyears ahead of CoD: Ghosts, not to mention the graphics. This was the last Call of Duty I have ever bought. Such a shame when you think of the great first parts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is fun and will keep you going, but don't even bother with multiplayer. There are so many hackers it is not even fun. They have hacks to see everyone on the map, shoot through every wall on the mp, even something that aims for them. Mods may ban someone occassionally, but they take no active action in preventing it. There is no visibility on whether mods do anything or how much and nothing seems to be improving. There are players who are blatant and have names like 'OMG ! Hes Hacking Report Him'. I'm giving up on multiplayer. I won't buy another Activision online game unless i hear they have done something about this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Simply not worth your time or your money. Infinity Ward proves once again that zero consideration is going into the PC release for their Call of Duty games and it should not surprise people. Infinity Ward are clearly not interested in pleasing their PC gaming fans and if they don't want to make a playable game, they shouldn't even bother making a PC version to begin with. Leave the Call of Duty games scheduled for PC to Treyarch, who knows how to please the PC community and knows what they require in order to play properly. It's both discouraging and unbelievable how bad Call of Duty: Ghosts is. With such a big step forward with Black Ops 2, it's infuriating to see that Infinity Ward still refuses to innovate and change."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"its year 2014 and they still havent fixed video driver hanging, dont buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you dont mind taking the risk"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst PC port I have ever played it is completely garbage and unstable and crashes every 30 minutes of play time. I'm done with this terrible game and I wont recommend it to anyone!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Tired of all the hacking people. It is recockulus. I think this will be the one to turn me against cod. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really not their best work. The story line is interesting and the graphics are beautiful but gameplay is poor. MP maps are too big and the number of hackers are to damn high.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The cheating in this game makes it darn near impossible to enjoy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Such Doge Much Broken Very cancer Wow *10/10 Realistic Fur
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst piece of s*** ever, do not buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game plays rubish DO NOT BUY FOR PC!!!!! It is locked at 60 frames and gets frames drops from 60 to 10 in seconds 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Until they get the anti hack program that is affective this game will always suck. Also the spawn points being random are terrible. You get killed from spawning more then anything else
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst COD EVER ! cheaters all the way and nothing is done by steam or COD developpers. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst think i might go back to blops2 if i rly rly rly need to play call of duty again!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Boring story, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC port, bad graphics. First COD I regret buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very poorly made game. COnsidering that a lot of elements of the previous games have been reused, many PC players including myself are having framerate issues and input lag/ mouse acceleration issues meaning that multiplayer is just a frustrating experience that is only memorable because of the huge sense of disapointment and disbelief you're left with. One pro though is that the single player is still alright as expected and it's clear they've tried to polish the game a little more but still this does little to redeem its other shortcomings, which are to numerous to count. truly unforgivable considering the size of the developer and the age of the franchise..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To be honest, I play Ghost because it's fun sometimes to get some fast-phase shooting (when im not playing Battlefield 4), but if someone were to ask me 'Should I buy ghost?' I'd say no.. I do no recommend this game in anyway. It honestly feels like a console game they have run throught their 'convert to PC'-program.  It sounds harsh, but it's not worth it guys :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst port to PC i have ever seen by a big organization like IW. Also for some reason, max settings gives me extremely low fps, and the graphics still look like 2009. Almost any other call of duty is better. I wouldn't spend $5 on this game. Also note this games takes close to 45GB to download."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recently transitioned to PC gaming and I have to say this game is not worth $60. I have an FX 8350 @ 4.4GHz, 8GB of G-SKILL Sniper @ 1600MHz and 2 GTX 760s on SLI (not bragging, but I think it's a decent build) and this game runs like crap. I own Metro: Last Light, which is a very graphics intensive game, and I can play almost maxed out. COD: Ghosts? If I attempt to max out the graphics it will go to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I would rather recommend Battlefield 4 instead of this garbage. I should have read all the reviews before buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST CALL OF DUTY OF ALL TIME !!  First of all , I aint a BF fanboy but an experienced COD player who played it since 2005 on every titles it has on PC. Before this COD was released I didnt set my hope up too high , but didnt expect it to be bad either because Infinity ward never let the fans down before.  The Pros  -Singleplayer (Mediocore , yes but I got no choice but to fill this in)  -New Extinction mode (At least it's new)  -'Create a Soldier' function in multiplayer  The Cons  -Bad Optimization for PC   -6 GB of Ram , 66 GB of HDD spcaces are needed (For this garbage , seriously ?)  -Mouse lag in Menu page.  -Outdated graphic which share the similarity to a game from 2009 - 2010 (Made me wanna know where did that 66 GB go? because the texture sucks ball )   -Bad Voice acting both in singleplayer and multiplayer. Hear some stuff from the Multiplayer Announcers and you will know that I meant.  -No more Ping indicator !!! , in FPS (multiplayer) gaming ,We need to know / aware of our ping all the time , Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did you remove it ??  -Sound system sucks , every ... EVERY guns sound like a low grade firecracker, like those low budget games. Maybe on par to Black ops 1.  -Worst map design ever , there is no fun !! , This is a downfall of IW in map developing.  -Instant crash (Blue screen , Black screen , Green artifects) in multiplayer for many user (me too w/ green artifects) espacially those with 'Nvidia' graphic card  -Boring Killstreak rewards , many of them are â€˜stupidâ€™  Call of duty : RUBBISH  4.5 / 10  *Another reminder , Go read my other recommendations on COD I always gave it a nice score, Iâ€™m a fans but this one is an absolute trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Glitchy as hell, even with the patch. Stuttering and freezes in both single and multi play. Wait for the patch that fixes this issue before you buy. You have been warned. PS to Infinity Ward.....Shame on you.....Shame on you twice.....shame on you three times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is already awful but now they are trying to suck people back in to the game with a free skin pack and a dog reskin, if they made the season pass was free i would maybe come back but not very likely"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is Call of Duty. It is likely you have already played it before. Not much has changed.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is pure garbage from top to bottom biggest waste of money th wolf dlc doesnt even work.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please don't buy this game.  1/23/14 - Game almost bricked my graphics card (artifacted like crazy then blue screen). normal settings, ATI HD 7700"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,way to many hacks hard to find a game without one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst Call Of Duty ever (having owned every songle one)! glitchy, cartoony and quite frankly dead in the water from a multi-player aspect. Will never by another and recommend you to steer well clear from this rip off!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Major stuttering and performance issues that make it almost unplayable and have not been fixed 3 months after release. Aside from that its a good game that I actually would enjoy if the aforementioned problems were patched. Hopefully Infinity Ward will put some effort into fixing its product's shortcomings
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game a lot, but it is teeming with hackers. Buy this game for console instead (fingers crossed they aren't there either)  Also whats with the 8GB of RAM? I run every game on the highest setting, yet with this it is on the lowest settings and I still have issues!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I realy would like to bye the season pass, but I'm absolute not willing to pay any extra cent till they  install a usful and succesful solution against the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥1ng hacker b1ches! This game was full of hacker 3 days after release and now it's more or less unplayble. I report 10 hacking player every day, but nothing happenend. I dont pay money to be frustrated, I pay it to hve fun.... "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would stay away from any and all IW titles for PC... I'm done with them. If they can't do better with hackers and FPS (even on High-end machines) that's it. I've played every title.... but this is the last one from me..... garbage. Sick of throwing money at them for crap product.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Still cant play the game smoothly, mouse problems even after fixes, Its worse than a bad console port"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Dissapointing. Series peaked with Modern Warfare 2. Its time to wipe the slate clean and start over.   Online experience is unbalanced and dissapointing. Who wants to play with enraged preteens that only run-n-gun with no strategy? I also dont buy into the campaign storyline. If they could have shot the train in the first place they should have. Revenge is not a compelling story. Finally, the game engine needs work -- there needs to be a better cover system, less lag, etc to make gameplay really improve. It hasnt changed for like 5 games now.   Matchmaking system is terrible. Most of the better game types dont have enough people playing, -- unless you have bought all the DLC.   I liked the dog though. Maybe the next one should just be a dude and his dog in a postapocalyptic wasteland. No heavy weapons. Just rifles and tactics.  Disclaimer: I do still play a fair amount. Need to get my money's worth! Just wish it was a lot better than this. It is still better than the majority of shooters ... but knowing I'm getting cheated on what should have been DLC for the last Modern Warfare .. that makes me upset."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WORST COD EVER! DO NOT BUY ANY PLATFORM!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! complete waste of money, game has been broken since day one and naturally they wont fix it because theyve got our money!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game sucks only few maps waste of money...don't ever ever buy this game not fun at all. i waste my 65.60$ on this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IW should be ashamed of this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crap game...always the same soup...aimbotter hackers, wallers, level hackers and many others... free in play.... I got a VAC ban without a rational reason... I don't hack...I just joined ONE time ( i can't choose any different!!! ) an unknown 'forced' server ( 1 kill = 10 or more levels ) for one game ( i left it as soon as i got the situation )...Game in decline from MW3...Don't buy this or any other in future...Battlefield battlefield battlefield even with some little bugs..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game have seriously optimizations issues im playing the game on a gtx680 4 gb with OC 32gb ram ddr3 and I73770k and I have a lot of low framerates on campaign above all when im using the sniper scope sights i cant shoot anything with 1 or 2 fps the game freeze with sniper optics. I have tried in many configurations High , medium and low and with diferentes resolutions and still having low fps in the same part of campaign."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,call of duty just geting $ for coping and pasting games now .... after this one i going to other games
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do not buy this game until they fix the texture issues.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if you like campers get this game........ campers just make ghost boring as f*ck
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst CoD Ever. Don't buy this game. Infinity Ward clearly focus on console version of this game, and ripped so many basic things on this game. The game itself is poorly optimized! The greed of the company exceed new levels. They even try to sell you a skin for your dog...  Try to play the game in march/14 still this game its not optmized for PC. Freezes A LOT in my RIG with i5 3570k / 2x gtx 760ti / 8gb - UNACCEPTABLE"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"not enough peeps playing the game anymore to warrant spending more money on the game....so over this greedy franchise....they stuffed it when they got greedy and stopped supporting pc gamers, especially killing of dedicated servers....dumb dumb dumb..... we got their company off the ground and made em millions when COD was purely a pc only game, and now they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on us for consolers.... I say get stuffed and go broke â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wait 'till it is substantially reduced - this should have been nothing more than a DLC, it is just more of the same. No level is memorable, and the fact that a dog is the star of an FPS says all... WAIT UNTIL CHEAPER!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same old stuff. Nothing new or groundbreaking.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,complex for sure----------its over my bald head
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This has to be the worst Call of Duty to date. Runs terribly on PC, nothing reall new in terms of features, terrible lag compensation, and all around, they could have done a lot better. I feel like they reall tried to do something new for the series, but nothing new works."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"While this game was fun at first, I got bored of it quickly. Alot of people who have played every COD snce MW1 or earlier would probably agree with me in saying that this game gets boring quick. The graphics look pretty good but the gameplay doesn't really stand out. Extinction fun a few times but doesn't have a lot of replay value, Campagn is fun once or twice but again not a lot of replay value, and the multiplayer is fun but gets boring quick since it's really nothing that new and spectacular.  Another reson why I was disapointed with this game was the fact that this game isn't really a completed game, their was lots of screen stuttering and screen tearing at launch and some of the features like PhysX don't even exist yet. Also for the first few weeks the online was pretty much unplayable because of the constant lag, but that has been mostly fixed since launch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Im not a CoD Pro by anymeans but when i play mulitiplayer its was a bad experience by that i mean join the only game i can play was TDM and 60% of the games i play there are hackers already i understand radar but when they follow you though walls and know exactly where you spawn everytime is annoying. Also not being able to play Any other game modes such as Infected or Kill Confirmed was kinda let down i like to switch it up with those but everytime i try it can never find any games. Also it could just be my computer but i have incountered many graphics glitches like water not loading right and my gun really weird to the point you cant see the screen and even with Red dot sights to will have this line. In all i was dissapointed with what i paid for if i could get a refund im all for it. :/
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a terrible PC port. The community for PC was dead day 1. Most people are only playing TDM rather than the other modes available.  They fixed some of the day 1 image quality issues but still a dead communtiy already.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Saw story line on youtube because too many bugs and screw ups. But hey at least Multiplayer works, kinda, just have to ignore the wierd yellow lines that pop of on the screen sometimes from the game. Great alternative for when battlefield 4 isnt working. NO SPLIT SCREEN! Video Gamers do have a life? College Kids play Game cube and such because they play with friends. I guess this franchise finds all the billions of their consumers live life alone."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is the latest steaming turd in the call of duty franchise, but you're gonna buy it regardless of how terrible it is so why are you even reading this. Honeybadger op."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many hackers 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hardly any pc support 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,POS game cant run all but 5 mins at a time before system crash ! complete waste of time and money !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute trash! As a COD fan, who has put countless hours in past games, over 120 hours in BO2, I feel betrayed that I have been sold a 60$ game that is so poorly done! I feel foolish for not believing all the hateful reviews for this game, and let it be known, this will be my last COD I ever purchase. Optimization is so poorly done for the PC, I don't even believe they tried! I run a over 1,000$ machine, and I cannot play this out-dated looking game on high, with 1080p? That is garbage and I refuse to ever support this clearly broken game franchise any further! Activision/ Infinity Ward, I hope no one else falls into your trap, and pays any more than 10$ for this terrible game! Easily one of the worst games in my library! Be warned Steam community, Ghosts is poorly optimized, looks exactly the same as MW3, is stripped of all its fun add-ons like: Zombies, Horde-Mode, or even a half-a$$ campaigne! Multiplayer is buggy, unreliable, and laggy to all hell! Stay away from Ghosts like its the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing plague! Get Black Ops 2 if you want a functional COD game. Simply the worst COD ever made, I am foolish for throwing away 60$ on such a poor title. Good-bye COD, you deserve to be shut down!  Concept: A very convoluted storyline with no characters you ever care about, makes the campaigne dull. Multiplayer is a major downgrade from previous COD games and is unacceptable. 40/100  Graphics: Everything looks very grey and dull, nothing looks like it has any life, very low detail in just about everything and low resolution textures are at an all time bad. Doesn't help that a 1k machine can't maintain 60 FPS while a 6 year old console can. 40/100  Sound: Sound effects are actually very well done and feel like they pack a very large punch! On the other hand, the soundtrack is very limited and quite boring to say the least. 75/100  Playability: The FPS stutters constantly, you feel like your gliding on ice, and everything is way to simple. Requires very little skill to be an average player. 60/100  Entertainment: Campaigne isn't even good for a single playthrough, multiplayer is broken to all hell, and the game overall just feels very boring and cheap. 50/100  Replay Value: Very low  Overall Score: 53/100"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just pass on this one.Does not worth the money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game gave me cancer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst call of duty ever, go and play battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Iâ€™m extremely disappointed with the PC release of this game, the graphics come to the same standard as Modern Warfare 2â€¦ The PC release has a multitude of extremely low quality textures even when running the game on Ultra. The layout also looks like they just add a cursor to the game to make it playable, very little change from consoles apart from horrible graphicsâ€¦ For a game that is 45 GB in size, it sure disappoints. *Story Line and online are, as always extremely entertaining* "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its full of hackers dont buy it 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,so far it's been a waste of money because everytime I play it freezes and then I have to shut it down my system is built to take the game but it just won't play any fixes out there I don't know.......
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is good. Multiplayer needs some work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"too many problems to distract from the enjoyment, wouldnt recommend "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nicht kaufen! Do not buy! Bad PC conversion. The few people left playing MP are the hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghost's singleplayer doesn't have the best storyline, nor realism, but it's definitely something that'll keep you occupied for 5 hours. You might want to buy for about $15 if you manage to find it that low.  The multiplayer on the other hand is absolutely awful. It's terribly unbalanced and butchered with Infinity Ward's religion of a locked FOV of 65; which if you unlock can risk a VAC ban. The only thing good about the multiplayer is the squad points system, which lets you unlock whatever guns and attachments you want without having to struggle your way up to level 55. Ghosts is also terribly optimized and will take up 51 gigs of your hard drive.  Overall: 3/10, and that's being generous."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"once again no dedicated severs for PC.will be the last c.o.d game i buy if thats the case.at least you can still have dedicated severs on BF-4,so i think i'll be headed over to that game,maps are bigger and looks better.i'v had almost all c.o.d games,and now i find it hard to find a game in the morning or late in the evening.most of the time there's only 3000-6000 players on line at all times.i played at a freinds house,and it said for the ps-3 it had 163,000 players online.guess i'm not the only one who doesn't like the game on p.c anymore.its sad,because i love p.c,and will stick with p.c games verse the ps-4 anyday.way to much lag most of the time in game.like when the maps change in mid game.kinda cool.my favorite game is still c.o.d world at war.they need to get away from modern wars,and try something new.i'm just boerd now with modern war games.i think alot of people are.their all starting to look the same.C.O.D GHOST is just the same old thing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even if you can tweak your game to the random settings via player-made patches, third-party programs and option exploits, even IF you can get the game to run a smooth 60 fps at the sacrifice of graphics, even IF you can get it to play through one round without crashing, or running into one of the many cheaters, boosters, exploiters, ect...this game is still garbage.  The developers have not said word-one about any of the multitude of errors and problems plagueing the PC version, and that itself should tell you to stay far away from this game. Hit-reg is a joke, suffering the same epidemic as BF4 where what you see on screen isn't actually what is happening in-game, causing you to fire at nothing, take fire from nowhere, and just generally die in multiple BS ways. Even the 'perks', which have been the CoD staple since the game hit mainstream, are broken and abused nonstop, with specific ones such as the Guard Dog allowing the mutt to not only to through walls to kill, run across the entire map at random to kill, but also to kill multiple times without going away. It's one of the cheapest perks to get, and also the most deadly. Nonstop care package and airstrike glitches, ones we have seen since the early life of the series, are still in full-effect as well.  The single-player campaign is fun, at least telling a good story, but the real reason people buy and play these games is for multiplayer. If you are a PC gamer, I could not recommend this at ALL. Activision just straight-up doesn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about your gaming experience, and pretty much used the money they got to further-fund next-year's disappointment. One I will NOT be buying. Never again.  Mark my words, this is the CoD game that will kill the franchise. And at this point, given what we were offered in Ghosts, I don't think that's a bad thing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Those 4K graphics....  Play a proper game, and save your money. I wish I did. Even on maxed out settings, it looks like a badly ported console game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst One in Call of Duty Series yet.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You want a review? Where can I get my money back? You do nothing to prevent hacker. So the game becomes usless because anyone with 2 brain cells get sick and stops playing. YOU HAVE RIPPED ME AND EVERYONE OFF!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Goats was better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible game, terrible PC port and more DLCs then it would cost me to buy a couple of new FULL games. Last CoD game Ill ever foolishly buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Finally, a game with working Fish A.I. Seriously, don't buy this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY! The worst piece of crap I have ever bought.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,And I thought Modern Warfare 3 was the worst.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,whole game is dlc crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horribly short campaign mode. Horrible Multiplayer. Doesn't matter what your rig is, the game will play â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's a port (surprise) and a lot of the graphical settings aren't very optimized for the PC. It by no means should put a hefty load on even the lowest tier gaming rigs today but low fps is a real problem with this game and it absolutely shouldn't be. The feel of multiplayer seems jagged and nothing special. The maps are the same old stuff and boring."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you consider buying this game, DONT!!!! the mp sucks, this cod is heaven for campers, already a lott of cheaters, it takes ages to rank up, if you have not played this game and if you think you know the defenition of backrapen you dont the maps suck and dont make sense especcialy the spawn points, you basicly spawn right next to an enemy. if you played bo2 and you really liked that, dont buy this game. it is truly a kick in the balls for cod players, like myself. and i havent even talked about the extinction game mode, and i wont talk about it because then i would cry blood out of my focking eyesockets. this game is fun the first hour because youre then like ''omg new cod, bo2 was awesome so this must be better'', but after an hour youre like ''i would rather play just dance for 24 hours then 1 single match of this crap''. IW could have made something really awesome that we would forgive them for the big pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mw3 was, but they decided to not do that, and for that im never gonna buy an iw cod ever again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can't believe I forgot to review this. Poor, just poor. Maps are too big for the numbers, maps have no traffic flow, scorestreaks as well as the meaningless content is underwhelming in comparison to Black Ops 2 (my first and favoured of COD games) and overall the game just doesn't evoke the same emotion or mix of anger and exhilaration as it's predecessor did.  That plus the fact they lied about it needing 6Gb ram and the dynamic environment nonsense too."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I would rather play Hello Kitty's Island Adventure for the rest of my life than to play this terrible pile of crap.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward. This game is so awful.  Lagging Fps drops FYI i use 3970x procie with 780ti SLI and still cannot play smoothly  Dont buy another game from this developer, worst support ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lags, not doing anything about hackers, spawns in front or beside an enemy, just ridiculous. Im a fool in buying this game, dont be one of us"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ive spent lots of money upgrading my system to the recomended levels and its still s**t. back to black opps 2 for me. see ya! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Could of been a great game, instead it is a hackerfest. Almost as if they are trying to intentionally kill the PC gamer market. If they implement a anti-cheat system. I will change my mind, but I see no support or even acknowledgement of a problem with cheaters. My computer is more than enough to handle this game. Don't waste your money on this or the DLC's. I feel sorry for first time COD buyers, if this is their first and only exposure to the series.  Corsair 800d case Asus ROG Board i7 @ 4.5ghz AMD 6990 Graphics Corsair H100 CPU cooler 16 gig DDR3 2x160G Vortex3 SSD "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As of right now, ghosts if terrible for pc. THere is no support for banning hackers, and at any given time there are only around 4k people playing multiplayer. There can be 500 people in a playlist and matchmaking will tell you that it still cant find a game. Very broken right now"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is garbage im mad that i wasted the money on this game black ops 2 is a much better gAME do yourself a favor and play somthimg else. the graphics arent clean the game play on mp is choppy horrid and not to mention no more than 5000 people on line can take forever to start a game of multiplayer. by the way i have a bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ gaming rig 6 core processor 3.8 ghz 16 g of ram with a geforce gtx 770 graphics card play bf4 a much better game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I took a few years off from the yearly COD release cycle and thought it might be a good chance to see what's new and was disappointed at how stale this game was even considering the last COD I played was the original Black Ops. The single player campaign is just like every other game, complete with random explosions knocking your character down as you're running between firefights and having to wait to get picked back up.   The multiplayer allows for good customization of the match, but even if you're just playing by yourself with a few bots you need to connect to the servers, and I've been booted enough times that I don't even bother anymore.   Considering they're still charging $60 for this it's a terrible value for your entertainment dollars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not so great. Maps tend to be overly detailed and too large. You exhaust yourself mentally going for minutes without finding a soul, then die in a microsecond once you do. Then enjoy spawning right next to an enemy so you can die again. The squad system is a waste of time as well, overly complex and making ranking up take way too long. Also, be prepared to run into cheaters using aimbots just like they did in MW2. Single player campaign is a yawner, lacking even the inspiration given to MW3. The Extinction mode is IW's lame attempt to copy Treyarch's Zombie mode, and at this stage feels like an afterthought. The system requirements are also gigantic, and it sucessfully killed my old HD5870 (although it does play smooth on the GTX760 that replaced it). Overall, this game just makes me angry, I'm glad I got it as a gift and didn't pay real money for it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst Call of Duty i have ever played. The graphics and performance on PC is terrible, and the requirements for it does not match up to the quality at all. It's got a good playability when it's not having framerate issues or lag, but IW really needs to learn that their ancient Quake engine is pretty close to kicking the bucket."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a bad game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,at first the game was running great then came the lag then the crash and now ican play please patch all of this crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player game is broken. FPS dips even on the newest GTX cards. crap game is crap.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,black ops is better then this rubbish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am so done playing CoD.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is bullsh*t I never thought this piece of sh*t would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lag every 3 seconds and freeze for minutes. I rather expend my money on good pixel games than in this expensive useless crap. I recomend no one every buys this trash I totally wasted my money on this game and atleast ill try to warn other people to not do so. That is what I have to say about this 'high quality game'
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wanted to jump back into the CoD series and have some FPS multiplayer fun, but unfortunately I can't even play the game 10 seconds without it crashing.   My rig:   i7-3770K 3.5GHz 16GB Ram AMD Radeon HD 7900 Series"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrid game, Badly optimised for pc, a direct console to pc port. P2P servers allow for rampant aimbotters, wallhackers and perk glitchers. When you finally manage to log into a TDM match ( low nr of people who still play MP )  The game will crash more often then a fat 11 year old epileptic kid on a dance floor. Do not be as silly as i was, do not buy this piece of horrendous 2001 graphics debacle."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer would be fun if not for the hackers. I hate paying big money for a game it seems almost 90% of the people that play this game are hacks. Takes the fun right out of it. Its not the American way to always take the easy way out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Single player was decent at best, but the multiplayer....wow. I played until level 6 and I couldnt play anymore. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very hard to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is without a doubt the worst game I have ever bought on Steam ever and it managed to make me feel like an idiot, mainly because of the fact I preordered it with the Season Pass( thanks to a keyshop only for 70â‚¬). I made the mistake to assume that there would be any kind of evolution from Infinity Ward's previous installment in terms of graphics and gameplay. Black Ops 2 was fun in my oppinion. Normally you would exspect that they take the advancements of Treyarchs work on the IWengine and build upon it like any good studio would do, but I belive they seriously lost all good men and women there which flew to Respawn Entertainment because visually and gameplay wise this game is alot worse than any of it's predecessors. Why is that so you may ask? Mainly it's because it's laggy unless you turn the graphics down to niveu worse than Modern Warfare 1. I have a GTX 680 (which is not a bad card) and I can play Battlefield 3 and 4 with solid 60fps second in multiplayer on ultra so wtf? So the perfomance is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but if you turn everything up graphicswise the textures still are freaking horrendous in camparison to BO2. Multiplayer is also a lot worse and the maps are boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! they took everything that was cool about the previous installments and downgraded every portion of it! I waited since release for this rant because i had the hope they would fix alot of the issues with patches but they did not they just added some pathetic effects that kill the performance even more and do not add much. So my final words are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Activision and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward, This is the last time I preorded a game by you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Go to Hell! If there was anyway I could get my money back I would try it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am so done playing CoD.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Decently fun, but its terrible for the PC. If you really, like REALLY want it, I highly suggest getting it for, say the Xbox since they actually bother to give a damn."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,load of crap !!!!1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,like call of duty II to many Hackers AND cheters sorry I was A big fan of call of duty not any more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is only good if PC is boss
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer would be fun if not for the hackers. I hate paying big money for a game it seems almost 90% of the people that play this game are hacks. Takes the fun right out of it. Its not the American way to always take the easy way out.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buy the game for Xbox, doesn't work well on PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game made me live in Somalia
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Notch has the right to sue these devs for stealing his textures.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game keeps crashing after many updates and this is the ONE game that crashed every time so my computer is not the issue. They tried to put too much into it and completly failed at getting the game to run smoothly. I just uninstalled even thou I payed around $50 for this game. The worst Call of Duty ever as far as gameplay is concerned, it lags and crashes and this time my computer just rebooted completly! There are much better games out there... "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. It has the same fast and responsive FPS action that Call of Duty is known for but lacks the uniqueness the series held. The gameplay becomes repetitive and boring. I could not even complete the Single player game because of this. Multiplayer maps are attrociously designed with plently of exploitable locations that allow campers to set up and farm score streaks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a fan of the Call of Duty series and I do not recommend it, if you want this game just buy the Playstation/Xbox version. Reasons for not buying it: - Terrible performance on pc  - Few people playing/ its hard to find matches - you'll find a cheater in 75% of the matches you'll play.  Trust me, I won't buy a COD game anymore (for pc, obviously)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've played call of duty since mw2 and this is the first game that I actually couldn't stand. You can say all you want about previous call of duty's, but they had some good moments and all around they we're actually solid games. This one was awful though. The multiplayer almost seems designed to make you bad. Maps are open and unstructered so you're constantly being flanked and shot in the back with no room to prepare or plan for it, and even the simplest of begginers can pick up the game and do about average. If you're thinking about getting a call of duty game, get anything but this. CoD4 has a really great multiplayer and a large fanbase still."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always enjoyed COD regardless of how good the game itself is, I, like most people still find enjoyment in the game. But this game is by far the most boring COD yet. THe array of guns in this game is just like Black Ops 2 in the sense that they suck in my opinion. The optimization for PC was obviously made by a monkey on meth, because unless you have a GTX TITAN, with 64 gigs of RAM, and a i7 4770k (and even then it probably runs at 50 fps) then you are going to be getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor frames, unless you bump your graphical settings down to very low in which the game looks worse than the original COD. This has to be the least memorable COD to date. Maps aren't anything special, weak gun line up (everyone uses the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing M-Tar), extinction mode has little to no replay value as it only comes standard with 1 map, optimization was rushed out of the â™¥â™¥â™¥, graphics are the same if not worse than previous titles, and even more. I've always thought that all COD's are the same and that is very true, but this one is the same as others and possibly even worse. This game also probably has more micro-transactions and purchasable cosmetic camos, and skins then say TF2 (BUT TF2 IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FREE TO PLAY!!). Everytime before you go into the online portion of the game it tells you about another DLC that you can get and it seems like every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing day now you see new DLC. Half of the games content seems to run on DLC since they came out. 'Should I buy this game?' NO, not unless it's on sale (like it is now), or unless you are a die-hard COD fan, 'cause although I get enjoyment out of the multiplayer (regardless of how bad it is I still find it to be a little bit of fun) I wouldn't recommend this game for $60, considering this game is broken, lazy, boring, DLC infested, rince and repeat COD. 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst perfoming game I own. Not many players online and those that are camp hard.  Graphics circa 2007 and even the console version has performance issues.  The first call of duty in history to be 50% off within 6 months. What does that tell you?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,do not buy it it lags so much and loading takes for ever worst 40$ ive spent do not buy lags are hard i cant even play the game with out lag it so bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game doesnt work anymore. dont buy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bug, crash, freeze, hack....  GG CoD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Everybody who bought this should be giving a refund, worst cod game ever made and the last one ill ever buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You got to be kidding me, this game sucks... Recruit and keep getting killed on Odin Station...  Horrible sound and running on Windows 7-64 bit system  Waste of money...   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pre-ordered with season pass and was really upset with the original outcome so waited to write my view till we saw at least half the dlc out. just got the second dlc and a big 3gig update....GREAT! willing to try it again seen as i have the dlc pass! seems like most kinks have been worked out but now the only major flaw is it feels like it should be played on a controller rather than mouse and keyboard (proper pc way). is this what the pc has to succome to as the 'STEAM MACHINES' come into our living room rather than at our desk??? still prefaring and thinking of buying black ops 2 season pass (just seemed more pc aimed and more fun)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lets be honest here this game is poorley optimized for pc, looking through your scope is an nightmare and try to play more than 10 munites before FPS dips, stutter, freezes this is not an game I will recomend to anyone with an pc if you have an console sure go for it but if you are an pc user like many just stay away, dont even bother.  Lets descus the hakers here now if infinity says they sorted the haking problem tell them they are talking rubish. I have come acros more haked lobbies than any thing els. Its an shame realy because of this ghost is nearley a ghost town.  Just do your self an favour and stay away. Buy this for your console and not for your pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Might as well buy a second copy of the past 3 Call Of Duty(s) .....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and single play just passes, this is the last activision game i am ever buying"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fix the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TOO MANY HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU NEED TO CHECK EACH IP FOR CORRECT FILES BEFORE THEY JOIN THE SERVERS!!!! A SIMPLE CHECK WOULD STOP THE HACKERS!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so laggy. You disapoint me steam fix it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"buy it for the xbox 0ne, ps4, xbox 360, or the ps3, but DO NOT get it for the P.C.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I must say after playing all the games in this franchise I would have to say this has the worst story. The gameplay mechanics are sound but the story is soooo bad. Other than a bad story its more Call of Duty.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"...I have a machine that can run this game real well if it wouldn't CRASH EVERY TIME I play it.... ...the graphics look good for what it is, if it wouldn't CRASH EVERY TIME I play it... ...that's to bad..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THEY SHOULD OF NEVER FIRED THE INFINITY WARD TEAM FOR MW THIS IS WHAT THEY GET FOR GREED THIS IS GARBAGE I WILL NEVER WILL BUY A GAME FROM THEM I MOVED ON TO BATTLEFIELD.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,First Call of Duty I did not enjoy playing... It's just terrible...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Have never even gotten it to run. Says I have an 'unrecoverable DrectX error' . I've upgraded DirectX (already latest version) and gone through the incrediiablt lengthy download a second time to make no difference. I'd like to get my money back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where to start? ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!   The game itself is fun, on console. The claimed 60fps rate is a lie, the game crashes every three seconds (so far haven't gotten to play more than three seconds at a time), and I'm more or less dissapointed with my choice to spend $60 on this.   Would I suggest this on PC as a gift? Maybe to someone I hate.   If I get it working right I'll change my review. As of right now this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  *UPDATE!* This game is worse than laggy, it is ouright unplayable with no updates or fixes in sight. Infinity Ward and Activision should be ashamed of themselves for selling out so badly as to realase this unfinished, unplayable, bloodorgy of lag. Even with over 7gb RAM, AMD A8-3500M processor, and Radeon HD graphics card ( a system I regularly play BF4, Skyrim, with graphics set on ultra and running multiple graphics mods by the way, COD4, and Blackops 2) this game is impossible to play. Un-freaking-acceptable. Untill you fix this game you should stop selling it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS CRAP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothing new or really exiting, it's like playing a hollywood action flick. 5 Hours max and its all over. Multiplayer is adrenaline filled ADHD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ riddled with cheaters, etc. Same old, same old ..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Has to be the worse COD for pc. I have been playing call of duty sense 1998. It is sad to say but I think COD is over for me. If you haven't bought this game yet don't, really not worth it at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Have serious issues with getting the game started, keeps crashing and no fix patches released to fix it. Total shambles"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is were i think the cod seriers died this is the worst fps game i ever played they need to stick with treyarck they know how to make games i hope they make a black ops 3 or something better than this piece of crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So whats to say about a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? not much at all. If your looking for a good call of duty go back to World at War just please don't buy this game. It is unoptimized as hell with stuttering on every single part of the game. Textures don't pop in half the maps unless you are running at extra texture resolution setting.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is by far the worst FPS title i have played in years. Not only has COD not changed since MW4, it has been plauged by unbalanced gameplay. Getting knifed shortly after shooting multiple shots into your opponents chest is getting quite old. problems that surround COD games are issues that have been in place since the beginning. COD is a genuine cash cow that i will not support any longer. Sad, but i must move on."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"compared to other CoD games within the series, iv yet to decide whether i like it yet as only got it a few days ago.  my personal opinion of this game is that the gameplay just isnt CoD to me, it feels more like Cs:Go with the CoD theme, the lack of settings and the such high recommended system specs for this game is a bit of a let down as not every 1 can afford to have such a high spec'd machine, luckily im 1 of those fortunate enough to have a decent pc. the FOV is a let down although you can download a FOV changer with no comebacks of getting banned etc, i havent noticed any fps drops or bugs as of yet, whether this is down to my pc and not really noticing them, i dont know. the biggest let down for me is no support for the cheating side of the game, not vac secure and no support from developers. i dont know my opinion is mixed, i feel it could be a good game if there was a bit more support, but then can it campare to the likes of black ops 2 and mw3 ? personally, i dont think so......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if your PC can't handle Battlefield, it surely can't handle this. the map sizes are far to over the top, with random clutter everywhere in most cases. the guns are decent with fun to be had and the perk system is great. however with the system requirements, map size, and the obvious Call of Duty logic and players, you would be better off buying a previous Call of Duty title such as MW3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"PC Online is a joke, the free weekend picked up a few more people playing, but still 2,000 players makes the matchups suck, especially if someone has high ping or wall hacking etc, I would recommend Black ops 2 over Ghosts, feel cheated that they got my money so i still play it some. but Black ops is way better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 Knife swings from 10m away that swipe at nothing but air kills.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cant play campaign without it crashing, some serious issues regarding some loadscreens"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,In every lobby are lots of cheaters the game isnt fun anymore.. and nobody is playing it.. One of the worst CoDs..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"By far the worst CoD game ever made. IW are the laziest developer in the gaming industry. Don't be surprised if they never make a CoD game again, guess them fish AI didn't do it for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"MW2 and MW3 where a lot better.  Crap maps, no demolition, no HQ... at launch it was unplayable.  Only fun part was the invasion mode, but it lags like a mofo"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ill never make the mistake again of buying a COD game. i'll stick to CS
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What could have been a fun game was ruined by technical glitches. Multiplayer issues with Nvidia GFX cards were never truely ironed out. GTX 550 or GTX 770 4gb. Machine was more than capable with all drivers up to date. I had LESS issues with Battlefield 4 and that should tell you all you need to know :)  Player who usually sinks 100+ hours into CoD multiplayer.   Didn't get my Moneys worth this time around.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It was awesome for a little while but lost it's sheen very quickly. The single player was fun if not a bit boring and the multiplayer is just too much for a player like me. I'm far too casual to feel like anything but an anchor dragging my team down and as a result tend to cop abuse/ridiculed in most matches.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The games single player is solid but the story is weak as usual, still the same 'WE MUST CHASE DOWN THIS ONE BAD GUY AND KILL HIM ONLY FOR HIM TO GIVE US THE JUKES SO WE CAN HAVE A SEQUEL.' we have been used to since Call of Duty 4. The 'horde' mode they used to compete with Nazi Zombies is boring and doesnt appeal to me and I am sure nobody else finds it interesting.  The game runs smooth on my AMD build have had no crashes or loss of frames so I'd say for me the game is optimized to my approval.  However, the multiplayer is absolute trash. The number one reason why it is trash is because the Multiplayer is region locked. I could find a match faster and with more people in it while playing Modern Warfare 2 then I could with Call of Duty: Ghost. Let me just remind you that Modern Warfare 2 is a few years old.  Also this game has too much needless DLC. Marijuana skins, a dog skin and paying 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars to be an astronaught in multiplayer? This almost makes Oblivion's Armored Horse DLC look worth it.   In Summary..... - Fix multiplayer matchmaking - Stop with all of the needless DLC - Make the Horde mode appealing  Do those three things and I will give a thumbs up."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I was excited when I first heard of the new storyline that went along with Ghosts and I expected another solid title from Infinity Ward. However, this game is essentially broken and buggy. I did enjoy the story however, I also feel that it is one of the weakest in the series. In addition, multiplayer is probably the worst so far. Given the price tag, and the expectations that go along with the Call of Duty Series, I cannot recommend this game. Wait for a sale if you must play it, but then beware of potential game crashing bugs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD to date. FPS Lag on high end systems, recycled graphics, riddled with hackers. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision, I'll never buy another COD. Don't waste your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is good in singleplayer but in the multiplayer there are too many cheaters and it is too caotic to play well
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a patch on any of it's predecessors, don't bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, other day."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty is the same thing over, and over, and OVER again. None of the small new features (Fish AI) were so small, they didn't impress me at all. Call of Duty really needs to try innovation."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If your a hacker buy this game it's fun, if your not (like myself) don't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy from steam. I have paid 50 dollars to buy this game and not only does it not work. I can't find out why it does not work. The game starts and the computer pops to my main screen and stays there. I can hear music of the game but cant see it on my screen. I have had a nightmare trying to figure out what is wrong with it and finally. I give up and just realize I wasted a bunch of money. Steam support is a joke and nearly impossible to navigate. You send an inquiry and nobody responds. If you want the game get an Xbox.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Specificaly Campaign and the mulitplayer sec Extinction gameplay is fun although not worth the premium pricetag alone.  Plus points: if your system can handlethe requirements are the graphics and the ability to practice with bots proves to be a reliable moment of fun.   Down fall and the crutch of the game for which we all want: Multiplayer  - Poor performance - Rife with hacked players ruining the experiance.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Developers of Call of Duty series think that by upgrading a game and making it more futuristic makes a game awesome. For instance, look at Modern Warfare 2, THE BEST GAME FOR EVERYONE. ugh!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Let's keep it short and sweet - worst CoD to date. Save your money or spend it on anything else. By buying this pile of c...p you're basically throwing your money out the window.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't... Even... Think... about buying this, it is not worth it, doesn't run well (even with good GPUs) multiplayer has a lot of lag and the campaing is the only thing that is not so bad. Go spend your money in another game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"terrible game, crashes every few mins..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crashes constantly, i had to UNDERCLOCK my GPU to get this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to work. DO NOT BUY until they update it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not right now i dont to many bug and hackers
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is dump, defenetly NOT WORTH 60â‚¬ !!!    For the one who wanna know more:  Singleplayer: - Linear very boring, very unrealistic gameplay - Extreme short singleplayer (although i played on the highest difficulty it took around 5 hours only) - They wanted to put more emotion into 'Ghost'  - U can see that they tried to do that, but they obviously missed something on the human nature... As u know u cant change the story (cause its linear) u dont worry about ur squad. If someone dies u either restart the mission or he just returns in the next mission (if he is a main character) - The Grapics still sucks + U CAN SHOOT THROUGH WALLS - Health Regeneration (its just crappy...) - gameplay neither intense nor interesting + SOME COOL DOG MISSIONS  -&gt; dog = too intelligent and overpowered - A few very hard laggs and bugs - Boring armory  Multiplayer: + U CAN PRUCHASE EQUIPMENT FOR UR CHAR!!! THAT IS JUST AWESOME  -&gt; too few different types of equipment... also no ghost masks which u can put different colours in or so... - There are still those annoying NAT-Types which completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u up if ure not a computer nerd who fixes that in minuites - Everything else is like the other Multiplayers of that Series......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth the money.. Wait untill the sale not take long the way the game plays
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has alot of fixing to do sadly but if it does seem to work on your PC, try the campaign its awesome!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The previews made it seem that the CoD franchise was actually trying something new, rather than a simple repetition of all their other games. But unfortunately, the only additions are tiny gimmicky mechanics that are obviously there for the sole purpose of saying they are trying something new in the previews. Gameplay is same old same old, and the campaign is one of the worst yet. Short, and there were several missions where I found myself thinking 'this is just a god aweful mission.'"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love the gameplay but this game is broken. Badly optimized and unplayable with framedrops. Only buy it when they fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you have sli titants. Then maybe you can run it in high.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Laggy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game with worst compatibility and performance :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy, Slow paced, generally CRAP! DO NOT waste your money (Trust Me)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is full of hackers online
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs so bad that I can't even blame it for being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yet, it's simply unplayable and haven't even been patched yet. Infinity ward are console lovers and you should wait for the next trearch game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD of all.  - Rushed, unoptimized and runs poorly.  - I played 900+ hours of Black Ops 2 without encountering any hacker, here I meet one or two obvious aimbot user every day! - So many players left the game, that player count is the same that Black ops 2 had after a year... - Map design is horrible - Killstreaks are useless mostly  Big disappointment."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Promises were made to make this COD game free of the hackers. Not True. There are more hackers in Ghosts than there was in CODII. Sorry to say, but, this will be the last of the COD games that I will purchase. The makers have no sense of responsibility when it comes to gamer satisfaction and fair play. Ther are no anti hacker controls on Ghosts, NONE that I can see."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,poor poor poor   veteran difficultly was soo easy unlike previous installments   multi work in progress full of hackers atm   avoid untill its been sorted  i love cod but it needs alot of work until perfect!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excellent Graphics in campaign mode, good ideas for the multi-player maps, and a point system which finally makes more sense than it's predecessors, is all let done by major lag in the multi-player mode making it virtually unplayable online. Even when you follow the recommended instructions, dumb your graphics down and open all the recommended ports, still ridiculously slow. It would be nice to be able to select ping rates as with Black Ops II but no. Overall I have been left sorely disappointed with all but the campaign mode and this is not why I bought the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hello, here is my full review for Call of Duty: Ghosts. Here I will be telling you everything you need to know about what is good and what isn't.  Well, this game at first, is good. I have completed the campaign before and I have got to say, it is far superior than the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one DICE gave us with Battlefield 4, but there they were mainly focusing on the multiplayer.   So; Ghosts has a superior campaign than BF4, yet BF4 has a greater multiplayer than Ghosts on PC. Why? Because Ghosts is terribly optimised for PC. It has got to be one of the worst ports ever in the history of PC Gaming. The controls are terrible: Instead of scrolling your mouse wheel up and down to change weapons, we now have to press 1 (or 2) to change them, which I find incredibly inconvenient, as it is easier and quicker to swap weapons with the scroller.  The best things about this game is limited. It has got the best engine in a CoD game yet, also a superb, yet cheesy campaign. It has got a great script, and an easy to understand plot, which Battlefield 4 lacks. The script is cheesy at parts- when it comes to the family stuff with Logan, Hesh and their dad.  The worst things about this game is probably unlimited. It is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port to PC. This time, Activision has mainly based their focus on console peasants. Why? I do not know. They have completely ignored the superior race, which is PC, as they are rich â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that would prefer to have their game bought for Â£40-50 rather than Â£20-30 (Amazon) on PC. The graphics- are the worst. Even WaW has even better graphics than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-mediocre game. The textures are dull and boring, nothing bright just old colours like: beige, cream, brown, white, etc. It's an all-round eye-sore.   They should really rename this game to, I don't know, maybe 'Call of Duty: Cheaters'? Because as soon as I hopped into a multiplayer game, there was a group of cheaters, who basically obliterated our team using aimbots and everything else to give them an unfair advantage. This game has a  lot  of bugs. I recently had a GT 630 which could run Black Ops 2 at 1080p on Ultra settings with AA on. This game? I can't even play it. I mean, there was just an engine upgrade, that's it. Now I have got an upgraded graphics card and I  still  can't run the game at a playable 1080p resolution. Also, there is a lot of lag and FPS drops. Which can easily be fixed by changing the priority to normal in the task manager. But why release a game that WE need to fix? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision and Infinity Ward!   This has got to be the worst CoD game in existense. It's good, but not as good as the rest.   My rating = 4.5-5/10  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision. You greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well... Here it goes (Compare to previous IW's COD's) My spec's, incase people are wondering...it not, oh wel..  Win7 64 bit i5 4670K @ 3.4 Corsair vegeance 8GB@ 2,000 MHz Samsung Evo SSD Evga Geforce GTX 550 Ti  Pro: - Custom Characters - Keep weapons and other goodies even after the prestige the character - New Guns - A bit better Graphic than MW3 - Better Attachment Choices compare to prevous COD - That's about it, as far as I'm concern  Con: - Laggy = Not ONE game is lag free...  - Still No freaking Dedicated Server = The only reason that I purchased this was because IW promised Dedicted servers...After horrid experience from MW3, I promised myself never buy any games with 'Match Making' system... I missed COD: WAW, which has Dedicted server that rocks. - Still too many HACKERS!!! It's too funny that IW includes a option to 'Report Player' a player for hacking.. LIke they gonna do something to them...  - Map Pack purchase. Already spent $60 and whey want a few maps for $@@? Right... I wonder if next episodes of Extiction needed to be purchased along with these map packs, too... Maybe it's time to jump to Battle Field boat..  Well, based on bad experiences with this game, I somewhat regret for purchasing this.... Should have try BF4...  NOT recommend this game, unless you are a COD Hard Core fanboy, who just want to see.. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many cheaters as usual. Hard to be honest when people can see through walls and one shot you with a pistol from 500 yards.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't bother, it's just a console port on PC. Left a bad taste for me, being a long time COD supporter!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is just a plain joke. Multiplayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, extinction is decent, and campaign is also decent i would say. IW has truly put their worst team together to make this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Console is a dream, but this is just an insult to pc players. My opinion: buy black ops 2, it's way better because it's optimized for pc.. Unlike ghosts... Worst $60 i've ever spent"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The story for the franchise has never really been it's strong suit (nor for many FPS) and it is no different in CoD: Ghosts. The game isn't terrible by any stretch but it does leave more to be desired.  Unfortunately it's hard to recommend Ghosts in it's current form, as it is horribly optimized for PC. Many of my friends have experienced frame rate dips for no apparent reason and have yet to see a fix or even an acknowledgement from the developer.   The Multiplayer is robust with many different game modes. There's also a new coop mode called 'Infection' which is a nice little added bonus."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What is up with IW? Black Ops II was WAY better than this. There is no bit of imagination or effort put into this game! I am serious! The game lags frequently, there is no storyline, reality is thrown out the window, the character customization is a really bad joke, the voice acting is terrible, and Extinction offers THE WORST GAMEPLAY EVER!!! It is really sad how much of a step backwards this is for the CoD series. The only good thing that I can say about the game is that the dog in the game is the most realistic K9 I have ever seen in a game.   RIP IW  4/10*"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, the campaign was quite interesting, considering the fact that the enemy faction is a Latin American superpower called the Federation(I am fascinated with Latin America and the culture), which is one of the few points I liked about this new story arc. But however I feel that the campaign is TOO SHORT, and felt that each mission ended quickly. The multiplayer is an atrocity, despite attempts to improve gameplay with new features. The maps are just too big, the problem is not about having big maps, its just that it just had the standard '12 players in one map' formula, i mean they should increase the number of players in a map along with bigger maps I shall say 24? Also with bigger maps, since the map has 12 players max and 6 on each team, instead of spending time to kill an enemy, you spend time to find an enemy to kill, and bigger map have given way to easier camping. The guns are overpowered, I can die in just 1 or 2 shots. Oh yeah, the game as a whole is an atrocity since the gameplay in both single player and multiplayer is EXTREMELY LAGGY, which puts me off playing both Single Player and Multiplayer as it is unplayable. Also, why is it lagging so bad and require so much computer space if the engine is not a new engine and the same IW engine just having significant upgrades and updates? Even a Predator computer meant for gaming can't even handle the graphics and requirements of a game that uses the same engine albeit with upgrades and updates. If this is such the case, I would rather they don't upgrade the engine and use the same engine version as Modern Warfare 3 or Black Ops 2 for a less laggier and more playable gameplay. I do not recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many hackers moving on to Battlefield 4!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not half as fun as any of the otheres and to many hackers makes me not want to play the game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When the graphics are turned up a little, it is an enjoyable experience but its a little stale as infinity ward have basically made MW2 again but WORSE!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Single player was decent at best, but the multiplayer....wow. I played until level 6 and I couldnt play anymore. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very hard to play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am so done playing CoD.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is absolute dog sh***! My specs say that I should easily be able to run this game.... After 25mins seeing a black screen the menu pops up, after another 20 or so the game is unplayable, so I lower all of the graphics as low as they go, go through the same 40 or so minutes of loading time and still EXTREAMLY gittery! Sort it out guys! not a cheap game and it just won't work on my PC, no excuses, I happily run BF4 on high graphics settings daily!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is without a doubt the worst game I have ever bought on Steam ever and it managed to make me feel like an idiot, mainly because of the fact I preordered it with the Season Pass( thanks to a keyshop only for 70â‚¬). I made the mistake to assume that there would be any kind of evolution from Infinity Ward's previous installment in terms of graphics and gameplay. Black Ops 2 was fun in my oppinion. Normally you would exspect that they take the advancements of Treyarchs work on the IWengine and build upon it like any good studio would do, but I belive they seriously lost all good men and women there which flew to Respawn Entertainment because visually and gameplay wise this game is alot worse than any of it's predecessors. Why is that so you may ask? Mainly it's because it's laggy unless you turn the graphics down to niveu worse than Modern Warfare 1. I have a GTX 680 (which is not a bad card) and I can play Battlefield 3 and 4 with solid 60fps second in multiplayer on ultra so wtf? So the perfomance is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but if you turn everything up graphicswise the textures still are freaking horrendous in camparison to BO2. Multiplayer is also a lot worse and the maps are boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! they took everything that was cool about the previous installments and downgraded every portion of it! I waited since release for this rant because i had the hope they would fix alot of the issues with patches but they did not they just added some pathetic effects that kill the performance even more and do not add much. So my final words are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Activision and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward, This is the last time I preorded a game by you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Go to Hell! If there was anyway I could get my money back I would try it!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,wish the single player campaign would be long like cod black ops 2   multiplayer is bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought this game yesterday and it doesn't even start! The people at so called 'call of duty support' don't even help! Save yourself Â£40 and DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game right now still alot of issues with the hackers, seem tobe getting a little better not sure way?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Unoptimised Garbage.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"There's just something wrong with it, Theres hell alot of lag and crashes, I think it's the best to get it on console.Playing it on PC will just ruin it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a rip off! again!  Shortest single player campaign of any game I have come across. And with no apparent CTF mode in multi player, this game will serve n purpose on my catalogue of games.  Last time I buy a COD game, they seem to dissapoint every time since MW4. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game sucks so hard, i want to stick my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ into my â™¥â™¥â™¥. when i see these russian â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s with cheats, i want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my keyboard. i loved the 3hour singleplayer, BOB SAGET, not, it sucked. Thanks to activision â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ard for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.  sincerely  captain browncock"
Call of Duty: Ghosts, Opinion based on single player story mode:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well what can i say, this has to be the worst COD in the series! it just doesnt feel right, player movement is just god awful, so sluggish, weapon balancing is rubbish, and the graphics HA what a joke, and for the this to be a so called 'next gen' game, really doesnt look like it, even with everything cranked up high it still doesnt look like an improvement over COD:BO2. Oh nearly forgot about the weapons, or should i say lack of, Seriously 6 AR's 6 or so SMG's, 4 Shotguns etc etc. really struggling to see what is in the 28Gb download for this, must be the code for the AI fish and dog! But for the single player, story wise was ok. but it was the usual led by the hand scripted events blah blah blah, so again no improvement, well more of a step backwards. in regards to Treyarch giving you a choice in how you played the campaign.  So in summary, do not waste your money, i put off buying this steaming pile for as long as possible (only bought it cause it was in the steam sale).   Right where is the Uninstall this heap and refund button?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money. IW sold out the PC gamers on this title. I was a COD fan for many years but the franchise has been slain by this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tier half finished unsupported pile of nonsense. Almost two months after release and it still can't run on my computer. EVERY other game of similar quality or higher specs runs like butter on my machine. This is clearly and unfinished half baked attempt to get con holiday shoppers into buying the next big TITLE in the COD series. The fact it doesn't work months after launch is just an insult. Wish I could get my money back.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game screen almost blind and only gray color present NOT RECOMMENDED
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no this game is torture no dont buy it waste of money unless you like it then sorry it like getting a gun and putting to your head and then seeing black ops 2 next to you but you cannot play it just this hahahah
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Have to buy a new system for this to work. Horrible programming.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"When COD eliminated the Co-op portion of the game it meant trouble. A multiplayer game of just running around killing each other is not what combat is all about. If you have been in combat then you would realize stratagy and stealth and team work is essential. Running around shooting in different maps is like an arcade game. COD 2 was acceptable and COD 3 was good, but anything else sucks. I am 69 years old, a veteran, and I play with many other vets and this is not the game to play. Oh sure you can play a multipleplayer privite match but all the modes are just running and runnnimg. I wonder what combat consultant said that is how combat really is?????? You guys need to realize that there are a lot of old vets and gamers that like to play and not just the young people."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing boring. The guns are awful, the maps are too big, and hackers all over the place."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,people think the games bad because you have barily no health not a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is already awful but now they are trying to suck people back in to the game with a free skin pack and a dog reskin, if they made the season pass was free i would maybe come back but not very likely"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Player count on multiplayer never exceeds more than like... 3500 people. The game is graphically unoptimized and looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even though your rig may be able to handle other games on their most maxed out settings. Its a rather poor port, and its sad that the all mighty and more powerful pc is made to run this game like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because this game company is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy to optimize and port this game from the console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hi,  I would not advise ppl to buy the game in the current state. All the bugs make the game unplayable at certain stages. Memory leaks during loading screens, freezes in game, blue screens of death,.....  Then there's also the crappy FOV and the rly mediocre storyline, no anticheat in multi,...  Do yourself a favor and wait to buy and download this (28GB) game until IW does something about it. Right now i'd give it a 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ruined by hackers!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too much stuttering...lagging and bad servers...waste of money...story mode kind of boring...finish it for 2 days only...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Rubbish. Only for kiddies or nabs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this laggy game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too many bugs and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, dont buy"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It really isn't that good of a game. Single player is lacking finished the game in no time, frame rate issues. Multiplayer lacks in enjoyment. Even if you don't get a hacker in your game which is rare the frames are jumpy. It just doesn't have an impact when you get done playing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Meh, not really worth buying. Performs just aweful on PC, no matter what your hardware is. The multiplayer is very one sided, only a few loadouts that will work well. The maps are quite bad too, most of them are way too large and make up for very long and boring low-action matches. The single player mode is alright, but as we are used from CoD games, not very special. The co-op mode gets, unlike Black Ops 2, boring very quickly. It's a very intense battle in just one map, once you've completed it, there's no point of playing again.  Not worth buying IMO."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"unstable... last game I will buy from this chain for a while, they droped the ball...Its like taking the one ring to rule them all( Lord of the rings ref) and saying 'hey you know what this ring that almost cant be destroyed needs that will make it EVEN better.. to be made out of straw!!!! then NO one could brake it!'   I only played less than half an hour and game crashed 6 times in Single player... Not even going to talk about online...   I have a gaming computer That i Only got last year... runs all other games at ultra high levels but can not play this at low"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game itself is ok, but for PC it SUCKS. Pros: +Good graphics +Interesting maps (but many are too large) +Unlock system is good +Extinction, Squads Cons: ----HACKERS. I've seen aimbots many times -Not optimised: From 91 FPS to 20-25 when something explodes/smoke. -Lag/No ping bars -Few killstreaks. -Some maps are just too big.  Overall, the game is OK, but on PC, with the optimisation, hackers and lag, just no. Multiplayer:6.5/10, but with the problems 4/10. Campaign was okay, could be worse, far from the MW series 6/10. Extinction is so fun, much fast pace, such interesting, wow 8/10. Overall, don't buy it if it's 40$+."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Big shame according to the big COD games the games does not remind me of any other COD game :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Black Ops 2 is much bettler than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ MW3 copy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign is okay, but the rest REALLY SUCKS MW3 and BF2 was much better.....  Dont buy it wast of money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If u Want to play the singleplayer go ahead but if u are only interested in the multiplayer save your money. This game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on pc no mater how good your rig are
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the only spoiler i'm gonna put in here is that the ghosts campaign follows a dreaded 'what if' scenario, which has more holes in it than swiss cheese. the game is just repetetive. if you haven't got black ops 2 yet, skip this and go for black ops 2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I really don't like the game but i am more of a counter strike person.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Great game if it was offered at about $15. Pure garbage at any price above that.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fails to deliver. generic multiplayer map and load out. Nothing new here. Bought from microsoft shop for 15$ and still now worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Everybody who bought this should be giving a refund, worst cod game ever made and the last one ill ever buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You got to be kidding me, this game sucks... Recruit and keep getting killed on Odin Station...  Horrible sound and running on Windows 7-64 bit system  Waste of money...   "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pre-ordered with season pass and was really upset with the original outcome so waited to write my view till we saw at least half the dlc out. just got the second dlc and a big 3gig update....GREAT! willing to try it again seen as i have the dlc pass! seems like most kinks have been worked out but now the only major flaw is it feels like it should be played on a controller rather than mouse and keyboard (proper pc way). is this what the pc has to succome to as the 'STEAM MACHINES' come into our living room rather than at our desk??? still prefaring and thinking of buying black ops 2 season pass (just seemed more pc aimed and more fun)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lets be honest here this game is poorley optimized for pc, looking through your scope is an nightmare and try to play more than 10 munites before FPS dips, stutter, freezes this is not an game I will recomend to anyone with an pc if you have an console sure go for it but if you are an pc user like many just stay away, dont even bother.  Lets descus the hakers here now if infinity says they sorted the haking problem tell them they are talking rubish. I have come acros more haked lobbies than any thing els. Its an shame realy because of this ghost is nearley a ghost town.  Just do your self an favour and stay away. Buy this for your console and not for your pc."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Might as well buy a second copy of the past 3 Call Of Duty(s) .....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and single play just passes, this is the last activision game i am ever buying"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,CRAP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ok, the campaign was quite interesting, considering the fact that the enemy faction is a Latin American superpower called the Federation(I am fascinated with Latin America and the culture), which is one of the few points I liked about this new story arc. But however I feel that the campaign is TOO SHORT, and felt that each mission ended quickly. The multiplayer is an atrocity, despite attempts to improve gameplay with new features. The maps are just too big, the problem is not about having big maps, its just that it just had the standard '12 players in one map' formula, i mean they should increase the number of players in a map along with bigger maps I shall say 24? Also with bigger maps, since the map has 12 players max and 6 on each team, instead of spending time to kill an enemy, you spend time to find an enemy to kill, and bigger map have given way to easier camping. The guns are overpowered, I can die in just 1 or 2 shots. Oh yeah, the game as a whole is an atrocity since the gameplay in both single player and multiplayer is EXTREMELY LAGGY, which puts me off playing both Single Player and Multiplayer as it is unplayable. Also, why is it lagging so bad and require so much computer space if the engine is not a new engine and the same IW engine just having significant upgrades and updates? Even a Predator computer meant for gaming can't even handle the graphics and requirements of a game that uses the same engine albeit with upgrades and updates. If this is such the case, I would rather they don't upgrade the engine and use the same engine version as Modern Warfare 3 or Black Ops 2 for a less laggier and more playable gameplay. I do not recommend it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many hackers moving on to Battlefield 4!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Honestly, Just buy something else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"played 2 hours, and now it will not play, tells me it did not close properly and freezes on opening"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is the latest steaming turd in the call of duty franchise, but you're gonna buy it regardless of how terrible it is so why are you even reading this. Honeybadger op."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst PC port I have ever played it is completely garbage and unstable and crashes every 30 minutes of play time. I'm done with this terrible game and I wont recommend it to anyone!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is absolute dog sh***! My specs say that I should easily be able to run this game.... After 25mins seeing a black screen the menu pops up, after another 20 or so the game is unplayable, so I lower all of the graphics as low as they go, go through the same 40 or so minutes of loading time and still EXTREAMLY gittery! Sort it out guys! not a cheap game and it just won't work on my PC, no excuses, I happily run BF4 on high graphics settings daily!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game was reallly good up until christmas when i noticed there are lots of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hackers now this is probably one of the worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing games in the history of call of duty feels like playing cod 5 i thought you would have had your act together you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tools why dont you take my money and shove it up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are you doing right now to stop this once again another â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in stupid cod game that isnt taken care of so thank you for making me waste my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money and my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time playing your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game always has hackers,other than that,it needs so many great pieces of computer.Only the good thing is campaign.I loved it.I only recommend this ame for campaign.I dont want to report the hackers because there is so much!The Infinity Ward should find them and ban!Do not buy this game if you like multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game was not properly configurated for computers. Cutscenes lag constantly and the the sound cuts in and out, so I am unable to listen to the story. I am running the game on a MSI G Series GT60 2OC-022US laptop, which exceeds the minimal and recommend requirements by a lot. I run the video settings on the highest setting and it tends to lag frequently. I switch all the video settings to low and the gameplay runs smoothly with some lag from time to time, but the cutscenes still lag terribly and the sound cuts in and out! The gameplay itself has a lot of problems as well, during an extinction match I planted the drill on the designated area and it would not allow me to switch back to my gun no matter what I tried to do and it showed I was still holding the drill. It stayed like that until I died, which ends the game. When I started playing the multiplayer it had problems connecting to the servers and I was at my friend house using his comcast internet, it would take forever to connect to the server. I tested the connection speed and the upload and download was perfectly fine. Therefore, the game servers are the issue. Sometimes the connection would just drop when I'm trying to connect in the game. The story, I think is just terrible, my expectations were that it would be better than the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series, boy was I wrong, (SPOILER ALERT!), the story was about how the confederation takes over most of the world and hijacks a giant space cannon that could obliterate the earth, then the confederation reverse engineers many of their own and you go and stop them in space. (END OF SPOILER!) The story was too easy to guess and just to plain and simple. The Modern Warfare series had a complex story of betrayal, trust and distrust between the characters. I cannot describe how good the Modern Warfare series, but it is a hundred times better that this crap. The only new features is that they added a few more of gamemodes that are not that fantastic and they kept the classics. That's it no other features! Which is very disappointing and they took out zombies ;(   Overall, the game was poorly configured for computers, even for the best of the best computers (Ex. the cutscene's sound cuts in and out and lags, no matter at what video setting). The game is very glitchy, especially during extinction mode. The Call of Duty servers are very slow most of the time and can drop connections while trying to connect. Story is total crap compared to the Modern Warfare series, when a game is made it should be better that the last one. Practically no new features were added. It seems like they just copyed the old game and slapped in a few new features and changed the look and story. Very disappointing. Not worth $60.   The gameplay was good (the shooting and killing part, not the story), but that was it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game doesnt work anymore. dont buy!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bug, crash, freeze, hack....  GG CoD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is a game when at day one you want to retrun it if you want a some what good COD game go with Black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its Call Of Duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,go get titanfall better value for money and game experience 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I cannot get the game to work properly on my rig. Again, a lot of features requested for PC players are not there. I would recommend buying it on xbox/ps."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Puzzle Pirates &gt; CoD Ghosts
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is bloody awful. Just impossible to have fun in this game because the multiplayer mode is full of cheaters which they will do nothing about and this PC version optimalisation is just plain garbage. 6GB ram required for this piece of junk is a crime. Do not buy this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So I bought Call of Duty: Ghosts-Gold Edition (the game isn't thaaaaaaat bad) but it said I would also recieve the wolf skin for my dog and the Onslaught DLC. I only got the game. I paid for it but got neither and dont know whats going on buy I feel like activision is conspiring something. I dont know whats going on but I want my crap wether or not its a glitch of some sort or Activision is a dickwad and keeping my stuff from me. I give it a thumbs down just for the situation. Can anyone help?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very laggy and un optimized game IT HAS NOTHING NEW ........SERVERS R LAGGY AND THERE R NO SERVERVER BROWSER AS A RESULT IT TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES TO JOIN A GAME .......EXTINCTION REALLY SUCKS ////NOT WORTH 35$
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wait until the game has been qptomize for PC until then there is no point in it .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bad lagg stutter and hackers and camps to boot... no fun ...780ti in sli
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buy the game for Xbox, doesn't work well on PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"50 gigs for a game that probably was planned to be released in 2006. Well, it costed a lot, so thats nice! But to be honest, how on earth does a 4 hour single-player storyline take 25 gigs? how? it does not make sanse to me, and I do not want that much space to be wasted on a 2006 game that was released in 2013. Some cool features though, they were groundbraking. At least they were in 2006. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has some huge faults. here are 3 that i noticed in the first 10 minutes of the game.  1. There is a car at the start of the game that has beed on fire for 10 years 2. The sounds does not corresponds with the sorunding areas for example: The theater has sounds that makes it sound like it is falling down. and apparently it has been doing that for 10 years 3. If you shoot guns in space the gun will fly backwards at a great speed allso shooting inside a space station will make holes, and the holes will explode the space station.  final verdict:  If you like just to shoot things then go for it, if you want a more realistic setting pleace don't look at the Call of Duty series"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game sucks....and it does so bad that there aren't enough words to describe my feelings,I wasted my extremely precious money on this garbage,the game stutters like hell,there are lots of slowdowns,crappy visuals,and the worst of all that it even fails to load fifth mission,,Hats of to infinity ward for creating such a garbage,and this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,Please do not buy this game and save yourself a huge amount of money,which you can spend on other games than this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,extremely dissapointed,the company should be sued and sent straight to the helll...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game keeps crashing after many updates and this is the ONE game that crashed every time so my computer is not the issue. They tried to put too much into it and completly failed at getting the game to run smoothly. I just uninstalled even thou I payed around $50 for this game. The worst Call of Duty ever as far as gameplay is concerned, it lags and crashes and this time my computer just rebooted completly! There are much better games out there... "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. It has the same fast and responsive FPS action that Call of Duty is known for but lacks the uniqueness the series held. The gameplay becomes repetitive and boring. I could not even complete the Single player game because of this. Multiplayer maps are attrociously designed with plently of exploitable locations that allow campers to set up and farm score streaks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a fan of the Call of Duty series and I do not recommend it, if you want this game just buy the Playstation/Xbox version. Reasons for not buying it: - Terrible performance on pc  - Few people playing/ its hard to find matches - you'll find a cheater in 75% of the matches you'll play.  Trust me, I won't buy a COD game anymore (for pc, obviously)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"20k people playing speak for themselves. when you seek a good CoD, go buy mw2 or blackops 2."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very dissapointed. The potential is there, but this game matching system stinks. It is very difficult at times to even get a game, especially if you want to play with other friends on line. Team up and you might wait for 20 minutes or more to find a game. If your alone it is not so bad.   This is also one of the worst games since maybe modern warfare 3, when it comes to hackers. Almost every night we find one in a game somewhere. It is sad that they have ruined the game. Even the X-Box friends of mine are not happy with the multiplayer part of the game. The only part of the game that is really decent is the single player.  Thoughts from an old guy......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game has potential, no doubt about that. But as others pointet out, performance is terrible. Seen multiple aimbotters in few hours of playing MP, i have played Black Ops II for like 400 hours and never seen an aimbotter. The spawnsystem, atleast in TDM and HC TDM is horrible, as it is in many other CoD's, but this one seems worse. The maps seems bigger than other CoD's, which is a plus in my book and the gameplay seems pretty alright too. I really like this game to be honest, but gets ruined by terrible spawns, aimbotters and poor performance. It's better than MW3, but still feels like a half finished game with a lot of fixes to be made. I'm sorry Infinty Ward, nice try, but can't recommend it considering the price. Thumbs up for adding bots though :) They seem well made."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is rubish get bf4 much more fun!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,... to much cheating. Poor grafics. Much to expensive.  MP Maps normaly can not be played after some weeks.  Poor performance.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IW cant do anything right. FAIL.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This, I have to say, is the worst game I have ever played. Glitchy, none of my weapons fire smoothly, and it seems that all the others guys are cheating as their weapons seem to fire fine. I am not a pro-gamer but I am not horrible either. One of my friends thought that the game would receive patches to make it run better, but so far no deal. It is too bad since I spent almost a hundred bucks on the game and the map pack."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,same garbage from like 5 years ago do not waste your money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Looks very amazing only if you have a extremly powerful pc, but looks painful on very thing else. Work on the optimization is the exigency."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no Freaking DLC there is no dl button for the dlc stuff
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"lag, worst spawns ever, everyone is allways camping so expect your matches to run out of time.  I really can't recommend this game to anyone!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love the gameplay but this game is broken. Badly optimized and unplayable with framedrops. Only buy it when they fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you have sli titants. Then maybe you can run it in high.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i was at first really excited to play the game then i got cod ghosts but when i played it even on low graphic its stuttered freezed and laged i was Disapointed to play it i though IW would have done it better I mean even MW2 And MW3 is better then this s*** D:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst COD of all.  - Rushed, unoptimized and runs poorly.  - I played 900+ hours of Black Ops 2 without encountering any hacker, here I meet one or two obvious aimbot user every day! - So many players left the game, that player count is the same that Black ops 2 had after a year... - Map design is horrible - Killstreaks are useless mostly  Big disappointment."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Promises were made to make this COD game free of the hackers. Not True. There are more hackers in Ghosts than there was in CODII. Sorry to say, but, this will be the last of the COD games that I will purchase. The makers have no sense of responsibility when it comes to gamer satisfaction and fair play. Ther are no anti hacker controls on Ghosts, NONE that I can see."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Laggy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game with worst compatibility and performance :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Laggy, Slow paced, generally CRAP! DO NOT waste your money (Trust Me)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is full of hackers online
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game runs so bad that I can't even blame it for being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yet, it's simply unplayable and haven't even been patched yet. Infinity ward are console lovers and you should wait for the next trearch game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i found my sound is bad quality and there is no way of changing it also the graphics go prety bad on optomised so have to do manual setting enjoy playing when going well not often ???
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its broken on pc pls fix
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You have two choices for this game:  1. Stone(camper)haven 2. Hacked lobbies.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,poor poor poor   veteran difficultly was soo easy unlike previous installments   multi work in progress full of hackers atm   avoid untill its been sorted  i love cod but it needs alot of work until perfect!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Excellent Graphics in campaign mode, good ideas for the multi-player maps, and a point system which finally makes more sense than it's predecessors, is all let done by major lag in the multi-player mode making it virtually unplayable online. Even when you follow the recommended instructions, dumb your graphics down and open all the recommended ports, still ridiculously slow. It would be nice to be able to select ping rates as with Black Ops II but no. Overall I have been left sorely disappointed with all but the campaign mode and this is not why I bought the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"worst CoD ever made. Not worth the money .... not even 10 bucks. It sucks so hard lags, hard FPS drops and again â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lobby system  The guys who made this have ever played MW1 with dedecatet servers?! i think not so if you make a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game the community can fix it but with this console copy not!!!  DONT BUY IT!!! Dont even think about it!!!! Get Battlefield 4"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,game sucks... waste of time and money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I will never again buy another COD. I've loved these games but the lack of support for PC gamin is ridiculous. Hackers, poor fps are just the tip of the iceberg. Infinity Ward, you've let me down for the last time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible game. Go back to Modern Warfare 2. The last good Call of Duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"nothing memorable, mistakes were made with this purchase"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ exactly the same as the rest of em buy battlefeild 4 instead
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Save your money and buy BF4 or something. This game is full of hackers which they do nothing about and it's poorly optimized for the PC. I wish I could say Activision had learnt a few lessons from the issues encountered with MW2 and 3 but alas they couldn't really care less about the PC community and it shows.  Early 2014 and Titan Fall cannot come soon enough!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game defines Lag. In every aspect of the gameplay, i'm running an i7 2700k + 2x GTX 770's in SLI. 256gb SSD and yet this game still lags out even sometimes during the singleplayer. Wouldn't reccomend buying unless on sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player campaign was actually ok but the multi-player game is just awful. I've always been a big fan of the CoD games since the very first one. It's always had the best controls that just feel right.  I pre-ordered this game like many others and I feel like I've been robbed. It feels llike they just churned something out to cash-in on the huge amount of people who pre-ordered this game. It's the last time that I will pre-order an expensive game like this.  Even if you put aside all of the crashing and freezes, the game is just unplayable. choppy graphics, low quality models and levels that, while pretty, are just not fun to play. The character animations are stiff and unconvincing. I probably haven't invested enough time configuring the game settings but out of the box it doesn't tell you who killed you when you get killed. There is very little feedback.   The lack of server browser on it's own is enough for me to not want to play this game. Without this feature the game cannot be taken seriously. IWNet was awful on MW2 and someone seemed to have realised this because MW3 had a server browser. Whoever that person was is probably long gone. The name Infinity Ward now means nothing. The magic that was once there is now gone. Maybe that sounds a bit over dramatic but I challenge anyone to play the multiplayer game and come to any other conclusion.  I've played my fair share of first-person-shooters and this is by far the worst. Even worse than duke nukem forever.   So, in sumary, I do not recommend that you buy this game.  R.I.P CoD You have sustained a lethal injury. Sorry, but you are finished here. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Very few players on PC version. Over half of the gamemodes are a ghost town and unplayable. People are wallhacking/moding rooms. Multiplayer version is very sad. The only half-enjoyment I had was in single player mode. Avoid wasting your money, please."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not only does this game glitch out and has poor res and Frame Rates but its already hacked......aimbot, wall hack.... like come on make a cod that cant be hacked please. We dont spend our hard earned money on expensive games to have some kid isntantly kill you once you spawn, thats not fun!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is full of cheaters. Developers and Publishers dont give a f**k about it. The game is literally unplayeable because of the cheaters.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If you like to play a real cod game..............this is not it! Things I'd rather do then playing this game 1: kick rocks 2: throw rocks 3:something with rocks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hardcore fans of the series only, otherwise I just can't recommend it - doesn't really do anything that Black Ops 2 didn't do, and it's very short (roughly 5 hours?) There are some nice touches in the multiplayer like expanded bot matches and the little mini-challenges that award care packages but even then it just doesn't feel as cohesive overall as Black Ops 2 did. They've made some weird choices with the weapon balancing, SMGs are useless now, ARs fill that gap and the new class of marksman rifles fills a gap that didn't really exist before.   It also has some really serious optimisation issues - even on a powerful machine this thing seems to chug."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In every game im meet with hackers, this is not fun......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,wish the single player campaign would be long like cod black ops 2   multiplayer is bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought this game yesterday and it doesn't even start! The people at so called 'call of duty support' don't even help! Save yourself Â£40 and DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No. Maybe later. Yes.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a rip off! again!  Shortest single player campaign of any game I have come across. And with no apparent CTF mode in multi player, this game will serve n purpose on my catalogue of games.  Last time I buy a COD game, they seem to dissapoint every time since MW4. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can play past 2 minutes... crashes... tried everything possible that I know of!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So after being a fan of playing Call of Duty games for about 6-7 years or so I believe this is the last one I will be playing. So lets start off with the campaign. Not gonna lie the campaign had me pretty despressed for many reasons and I honestly want to take up for this game because of how much I used to love playing Call of Duty but there is almost nothing that is surprisingly good about the campaign. The campaign had good potential I went in thinking that I was gonna be holding on the edge of my seat but I wasn't and like I already stated there wasn't anything too interesting and felt really repetitive and actually made me become really bored of it really fast. They promote the dog riley alot but you don't get to play or see him as much as you would like in this game. But there is a plus and that is the graphics I found the graphics to be very pleasing in this game and I felt that it was well achieved, but still doesn't make up for the cons in my opinion. And i'm not gonna spoil the ending but I honestly didn't know what to think and after thinking for awhile I think the ending was a bit sudden no real event leading to the ending and I believe if you play it you will know what I mean. I sadly give the campaign a 1.5/5.    And now for the online multiplayer review. Now i'm not gonna lie the multiplayer would be REALLY good if they just fixed a couple things. But anyways getting right into it lets talk about the maps I feel the are very big for the 6v6 matches you get into. It gets really boring when you are running around and you can't find anyone to kill. But the graphics of this game make the maps look gourgeous (not as good as BF4) but they still look really good. Now lets talk about the killcam problem. Now some of you might have noticed this bug happen and might be fixed but when I get killed it looks like I shot him first but in his killcam I didn't even fire a bullet and he somehow wins the gunfight, but luckly that doesn't happen all that much anymore but gets really annoying when it does happen. Were gonna talk about the hackers now. Now people may already know this but in the PC community hacking is very easy to do and anyone could do it with just one download of a hack and it has pretty much over populated this game every game I get in I come across a hacker. And the thing that really upsets me is that Infinity Ward (the creators of Ghosts) won't do anything about it maybe 10 people have been banned out of the THOUSANDS of hackers there are in this game. All they have to do is get an anti-cheat software but for some reason they won't it kind of confuses me. I feel like PC doesn't get the love like the next gen consoles do and it upsets me and that is why this is most likely the last Infinity Ward Call of Duty that I will play. Online Multiplayer gets a 2/5 for me it doesn't meet up to the expectations I had and I think anyone had for it.    THIS HAS TO BE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IEST GAME OF 2012."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it could be better
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i like cod but this one sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"didnt live up to expectations on pc,been getting a little better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"unoptimized, cheaters in almost every lobby, total lack of rentable dedicated servers, no ping bar preordering will get you a free fall i didn't saw it since launch 0 players in playist of free fall included large framerate drops, safeguard and extinction causing BSOD (blue screen of death) and much much more stuff..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game to anyone, it lags, crashes and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s up all the time.  Cannot even launch campaign without it crashing right after the intro. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game ever, I can run BF4 on ultra without any issues but a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game like this I cannot. Stupid."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too jittery, screen freezes in online combat every single time an enemy is encountered at close quarters, once it unfresses, youre dead. I expected much more than this from Infinity Ward, but cant say Im surprised with their publisher being Activision- they have a long history of forcing release of games before theyre ready and releasing multiple bug fixes and patches later. Its more frustrating than anything to just turn the game on at all, hoping to have a fun time and end up angry instead. Worthless and cant even be called 'entertainment' as far as I see it. I have a mid range machine (8 core i7, 2 GB dual video cards and 8 GB DDR3 Ram) as far as this game requirements are concerned, but its no slouch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORSE GAME FOR THE MONEY, THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH 60 or even 30 which was the price i bought it for. NEVER GET THIS GAME UNLESS ITS UNDER 5 DOLLARS"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is the worst COD version in history. Poor graphics and controls, bad designed maps. It doens't play smooth. You can almost even follow a bullet. You would have more fun with the previous releases."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty is the same thing over, and over, and OVER again. None of the small new features (Fish AI) were so small, they didn't impress me at all. Call of Duty really needs to try innovation."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The weakest of the Call of Duty franchise. Infinity Ward to major steps backward in this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game ever made my activision for the pc hands down! A multiplayer game with build in auto assist for the pc is the dumbest thing I have ever heard of. I paid 60 bucks for this game and I can't even play it because of everyone just locks onto me before i can even fire. The people that dont have cosnsole controllers don't even bother wasting your money. NOT buying from activision again because of this and I have been with the series since it started. I am SUPREMELY dissapointed.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well i have deleted my last review... and for damn good reason...  this game plays like crap!!!!  no matter what you play it on!!!  the graphics are terrible the game freezes unexpectedly for no reason....  everyone on this game seems to be pro's at it and finally  it takes anything and everything that was ever good about call of duty and flushes it down the toilet!!!  i only bought this for Â£20 and i want my money back!!!!   reccomend to anyone???? NO!!!!!!!  so the next call of duty will not be purchased sorry activision but you have dropped the ball i'll go play bf4 instead!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Developers of Call of Duty series think that by upgrading a game and making it more futuristic makes a game awesome. For instance, look at Modern Warfare 2, THE BEST GAME FOR EVERYONE. ugh!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ive really tried to give this game a chance again and again and people say that thay will come out with the so called VAC or other anti cheat programs but im not w8ting any more. its allso too late for them to fix the game (bugs/anti cheat) now couse thay allready lost like 80% players and thair trust in the game. so im so deeply sorry 'IW' you have ruine one of my geeky gaming nights for the last time and i will not vouch for you any more  COD:Ghosts Was dead, even before it was released. and im affraid it will stays that way  (Minded on PC)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"lag fest.... that is all, also no FOV options dont purchase"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you want a COD game for PC buy Black ops 2. That game is optimised, this one however is not and at this point it will never be properly fixed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ran through campaign way too quickly. Multiplayer doesn't work because 'server is not available'. Very disappointed.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the commercials for this game are great, the actual game however is the worst one yet in the franchise, poor matchmaking, no punkbuster and apparently no punishments for hacking (which is rampant). those 3 things make this game so frustrating that it's not worth 5 dolars let alone 50."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Like many people here I have been with the franchise since it began in 2003 but now I feel that the once great developer Infinity Ward (more like Infinitely Wasted) has let down the dedicated fan following with this iteration of the series if it can be called that.  When I started playing the game it had horrible fps drops which still exist and that's not acceptable for a PC port from such a developer. Not only are there frequent fps drops but they happen in the same places and this started to stink of poor optimization by the developers. Besides that, the texture quality is totally overrated for a 2013 game: it's nowhere near on par with the likes of Battlefield 4 (all problems with that game aside) where the graphics warranted the beefy system requirements, this game has high specifications but the graphics don't justify having them to begin with which I think is a waste and outright false advertising.  That being said I can't even find a way to display the game's fps...like as if the developers intentionally blocked it because they know their game is terrible.  What has annoyed me about this game the most is the story: while previous games have had some pretty outlandlish plot lines, the story in this game's singleplayer campaign is so stupid that it really didn't provide anything exciting...the Michael Bay explosion-fests are getting boring. What put the cherry on top was the ending - it was such a cheap move that it was practically screaming 'sequel'. Considering this story was written by a Hollywood screenwriter you'd think it would be something decent...but no, it's just dumbed down to allow for the stupid explosion-fests.  Is it worth getting this game? I don't think so. You may as well get Battlefield 4 or wait for Titanfall and have fun in those games than in COD: Ghosts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hello, here is my full review for Call of Duty: Ghosts. Here I will be telling you everything you need to know about what is good and what isn't.  Well, this game at first, is good. I have completed the campaign before and I have got to say, it is far superior than the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one DICE gave us with Battlefield 4, but there they were mainly focusing on the multiplayer.   So; Ghosts has a superior campaign than BF4, yet BF4 has a greater multiplayer than Ghosts on PC. Why? Because Ghosts is terribly optimised for PC. It has got to be one of the worst ports ever in the history of PC Gaming. The controls are terrible: Instead of scrolling your mouse wheel up and down to change weapons, we now have to press 1 (or 2) to change them, which I find incredibly inconvenient, as it is easier and quicker to swap weapons with the scroller.  The best things about this game is limited. It has got the best engine in a CoD game yet, also a superb, yet cheesy campaign. It has got a great script, and an easy to understand plot, which Battlefield 4 lacks. The script is cheesy at parts- when it comes to the family stuff with Logan, Hesh and their dad.  The worst things about this game is probably unlimited. It is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port to PC. This time, Activision has mainly based their focus on console peasants. Why? I do not know. They have completely ignored the superior race, which is PC, as they are rich â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that would prefer to have their game bought for Â£40-50 rather than Â£20-30 (Amazon) on PC. The graphics- are the worst. Even WaW has even better graphics than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-mediocre game. The textures are dull and boring, nothing bright just old colours like: beige, cream, brown, white, etc. It's an all-round eye-sore.   They should really rename this game to, I don't know, maybe 'Call of Duty: Cheaters'? Because as soon as I hopped into a multiplayer game, there was a group of cheaters, who basically obliterated our team using aimbots and everything else to give them an unfair advantage. This game has a  lot  of bugs. I recently had a GT 630 which could run Black Ops 2 at 1080p on Ultra settings with AA on. This game? I can't even play it. I mean, there was just an engine upgrade, that's it. Now I have got an upgraded graphics card and I  still  can't run the game at a playable 1080p resolution. Also, there is a lot of lag and FPS drops. Which can easily be fixed by changing the priority to normal in the task manager. But why release a game that WE need to fix? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision and Infinity Ward!   This has got to be the worst CoD game in existense. It's good, but not as good as the rest.   My rating = 4.5-5/10  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision. You greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"im currently stationed at NAS Pensacola as a Marine Corps Aviation Mechanic, so I purchased this game at the Navy Exchange. I paid full price for it. I wish i hadnt. I think ive played a total of 3 hour on this game? Online lags like crazy and my ping is 60-70 constantly, there are hackers, single player is okay, if it doesnt crash... just annoyed i wasted 60 bucks on a game that is unstable as hell."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well... Here it goes (Compare to previous IW's COD's) My spec's, incase people are wondering...it not, oh wel..  Win7 64 bit i5 4670K @ 3.4 Corsair vegeance 8GB@ 2,000 MHz Samsung Evo SSD Evga Geforce GTX 550 Ti  Pro: - Custom Characters - Keep weapons and other goodies even after the prestige the character - New Guns - A bit better Graphic than MW3 - Better Attachment Choices compare to prevous COD - That's about it, as far as I'm concern  Con: - Laggy = Not ONE game is lag free...  - Still No freaking Dedicated Server = The only reason that I purchased this was because IW promised Dedicted servers...After horrid experience from MW3, I promised myself never buy any games with 'Match Making' system... I missed COD: WAW, which has Dedicted server that rocks. - Still too many HACKERS!!! It's too funny that IW includes a option to 'Report Player' a player for hacking.. LIke they gonna do something to them...  - Map Pack purchase. Already spent $60 and whey want a few maps for $@@? Right... I wonder if next episodes of Extiction needed to be purchased along with these map packs, too... Maybe it's time to jump to Battle Field boat..  Well, based on bad experiences with this game, I somewhat regret for purchasing this.... Should have try BF4...  NOT recommend this game, unless you are a COD Hard Core fanboy, who just want to see.. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is great from a graphics standpoint, gameplay is good, not great, but the worst part is the number of people hacking on PC. It's unreal. I've been playing COD games for over 4 years online and I've never seen it this bad. People are actually bragging about hacking the game and saying they will never get caught. How is it that a multi-billion dollar corporation can let these scum ruin their brand? I don't understand it. I do know that I'm done buying these games. Activision can forget me spending any money on DLCs, add-ons, or anything else unless that put in a legitimate anti-cheat system to get rid of the wallers and botters."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"personally i didnt like it i ill give it a 2 out of 6 rating just cus the maps are bigger and there is alot of empty space,u need a good computer to only run it and hope 2 not play it with lags and not all people have really good computers with 6-8 ram compare it with BlackOps2 and its like they took the game and threw it to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What a pile of poo! Even months after release it's unplayable with FPS issues and horrible lag in multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Im done with Ghosts..... just no
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is good. Multiplayer needs some work
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"too many problems to distract from the enjoyment, wouldnt recommend "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nicht kaufen! Do not buy! Bad PC conversion. The few people left playing MP are the hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is fun enough, can probably find a sp only version online somewhere though.  Don't waste your money if you just want the multiplayer. Met 3 hackers within 4 hours, obviously something wrong with their code if it's that common.  On that note can probably find a free version of it online too. I doubt people are forking out 90 bucks just to hack. Then again, not sure what the ban rate is.  Overall, worth for single player, don't bother for multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghost's singleplayer doesn't have the best storyline, nor realism, but it's definitely something that'll keep you occupied for 5 hours. You might want to buy for about $15 if you manage to find it that low.  The multiplayer on the other hand is absolutely awful. It's terribly unbalanced and butchered with Infinity Ward's religion of a locked FOV of 65; which if you unlock can risk a VAC ban. The only thing good about the multiplayer is the squad points system, which lets you unlock whatever guns and attachments you want without having to struggle your way up to level 55. Ghosts is also terribly optimized and will take up 51 gigs of your hard drive.  Overall: 3/10, and that's being generous."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even if you can tweak your game to the random settings via player-made patches, third-party programs and option exploits, even IF you can get the game to run a smooth 60 fps at the sacrifice of graphics, even IF you can get it to play through one round without crashing, or running into one of the many cheaters, boosters, exploiters, ect...this game is still garbage.  The developers have not said word-one about any of the multitude of errors and problems plagueing the PC version, and that itself should tell you to stay far away from this game. Hit-reg is a joke, suffering the same epidemic as BF4 where what you see on screen isn't actually what is happening in-game, causing you to fire at nothing, take fire from nowhere, and just generally die in multiple BS ways. Even the 'perks', which have been the CoD staple since the game hit mainstream, are broken and abused nonstop, with specific ones such as the Guard Dog allowing the mutt to not only to through walls to kill, run across the entire map at random to kill, but also to kill multiple times without going away. It's one of the cheapest perks to get, and also the most deadly. Nonstop care package and airstrike glitches, ones we have seen since the early life of the series, are still in full-effect as well.  The single-player campaign is fun, at least telling a good story, but the real reason people buy and play these games is for multiplayer. If you are a PC gamer, I could not recommend this at ALL. Activision just straight-up doesn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about your gaming experience, and pretty much used the money they got to further-fund next-year's disappointment. One I will NOT be buying. Never again.  Mark my words, this is the CoD game that will kill the franchise. And at this point, given what we were offered in Ghosts, I don't think that's a bad thing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like the game a lot, but it is teeming with hackers. Buy this game for console instead (fingers crossed they aren't there either)  Also whats with the 8GB of RAM? I run every game on the highest setting, yet with this it is on the lowest settings and I still have issues!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Takes too much to run.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Infinity Ward. This game is so awful.  Lagging Fps drops FYI i use 3970x procie with 780ti SLI and still cannot play smoothly  Dont buy another game from this developer, worst support ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lags, not doing anything about hackers, spawns in front or beside an enemy, just ridiculous. Im a fool in buying this game, dont be one of us"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is awful, I've been a COD fan since they came out on the ps2. My computer can almost max out bf4 but I cant even play this game for more than a few minutes before it crashes."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible too many hackers. No moderators gives two **** about the hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would not buy this game. I used to love the CoD brand, but this release is buggy on my high-end rig, and terrible FPS. The story line is so dated, you know exactly what is about to happen.  I am still playing this game because I paid 60.00 for it, and I might as well get something for it. However, I may just dump it because life is too short.  60.00 down the drain, doesn't mean I have to waste the rest of my life. I doubt I would buy another CoD game unless I seem some reviews indicating IW put some effort into this series again. So Sad."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I took a few years off from the yearly COD release cycle and thought it might be a good chance to see what's new and was disappointed at how stale this game was even considering the last COD I played was the original Black Ops. The single player campaign is just like every other game, complete with random explosions knocking your character down as you're running between firefights and having to wait to get picked back up.   The multiplayer allows for good customization of the match, but even if you're just playing by yourself with a few bots you need to connect to the servers, and I've been booted enough times that I don't even bother anymore.   Considering they're still charging $60 for this it's a terrible value for your entertainment dollars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So glad i got this game at half price over christmas!! Boy am I happy I did. I couldn't believe it when i saw the sale on Amazon. Awesome. At least I don't feel so bad buying it now!!! I even went so far as to buy another graphics card for I was looking forward to this game along with BF4. What a friggin nightmare. First off you have read the others nothing but stutters and crashes. What a piece of junk. They have hit the all time low of software. Congratulations you out did Microsoft in all its crap. BF4? WOW here i bought these two titles figureing having a hard copy cd that I wouldn't have to mess with steam or origin. Ya right. Origin you have to run it through a browser plug in just to play. WTF is that?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All they said on the site was to activate it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off!!! Now BF4 has totally crashed can't even pull it up. Back to COD , runs a little better yet constantly crashes. Be the last time i buy somethinng from EA or Activision I tell ya that. Add insult to injury they make it nearly impossible to get any info on what they are doing to fix the problems . How nice to treat your customers in this manner. Can you imagine pre-ordering this POS????? TOTAL JUNK!!!!!!! Well in any event i got my new card I wanted anyway. Don't even bother wasting your time or money on this trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Constant Single Player Campaign lock-ups, and not simple ones that can be escaped with Ctrl+Alt+Del.. These are big ones that have me having to turn it off with the power button it's so locked up. I should add that my PC is well above the requirements.  Very suprised that they would release a game in such a state."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Potentially the best and worst CoD in history. While the Singleplayer is cinetastic and well made, its as allways super linear and wont let you do anything by yourself. Which is ok to this extend, still the ending lacked selfawareness and was just another 'AMERICA F*** YEAH!' moment. The biggest improvements were made in the Multiplayer, good ones as bad ones. While they cranked up ( get it cranked... never mind ) the controls and the flow of the game ( it just feels great and so satisfing to slide around a corner and get a double or tripple kill on surprised players ), they missed to put in an reliable ANTI-CheatSoftware! How can this happen? I played about 100Hours of MP and i captured most of the gameplay and in over 50% of my matches i encounterd aimbot/wallhackers, firing from the hip with an lmg threw walls doing headshot after headshot. Srsly though, i have proof of it captured in game, TONS of it. I just cant understand how anyone would have told the developers of this game, ' We surely dont need any of these fancy Anti-Cheater Tools, dont we? ' ! What the F***? But again this game has probably one of the best maps ever in Call of Duty History so far, at least 50% are 100% competetive and well thought out, but then again were are the dedicated servers, yes there are a few 'dedicated lobbys' as you need to call them, because on PC we understand dedicated server as some thing we can lease or own. Where we can have the rules we want. Where we can kick cheaters, and ppl we dont want to have in our games, we can have little communitys around these servers having tons of fun, nope not with this Game!  MY suggestion is dont buy this Game, dont buy any FPS, Until the Publishers understand that they cant do what ever they like with us.  TL: DR:  They advanced some ideas of BO2, they took back a lot of good things and they made promises they didnt keep up. DONT BUY"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,A waste of Money ...... the commercials were good... This is the Last COD I will ever buy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Do NOT waste your Money !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wish i can refund the money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The worst call of duty to date. Great graphics and feels somewhat stable but all game modes are what seems to be set in hardcore mode. Do not buy for full price, game is worth about $30"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i thought it would be coo but no
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Problems listed: Artifacting on AMD cards Lag Data not stored on server, like favourite weapon and max kill streak"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Uses up too much hardware for what its worth. Then they come out with a map pack that cost more than the game. Switching to battlefield
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is terrible! DO NOT BUY IT!  No computer on earth can handle the PC specs and to prove how bad it is here is my diagnostics and all information I have aquired.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/209160/discussions/0/666824801339039672/ 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Its not a bad game only you can see that the Call of Duty series is going for the consoles and not the pc. And thats not so strange when there biggest sponsor is Microsoft Xbox. If you look at the Battlefield series they are more going for the pc gamers and the clans and communitys on the pc. With dice they have it done right. At the COD series they don''t care about the pc gamers so as long we buy the game they will not give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if its bad or not. Everytime they promise dedicated servers and it will not be done or unranked.  So i say lets we all stop buying any COD game on the pc and lets see if they will do something more for us. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single worst COD I've played since COD3. Where do I start? I don't care too much about the RAM restiction since I have 8GB but there are still proformance issues even with rigs over the minimum requirements. I don't care how 'Next-gen' this game is suppose to be; it runs like boiled feces. Any game that needs to have the priority tweaked in the task manager is asking for trouble. But what about the game itself? The actual game has to be good right?  Nope! The campaign is the worst one yet. It's a by the numbers experiance that proves every COD naysayer right. There's no sparkle that previous COD campaigns had. No grand antaganist that has some charm or ability to garner hatred toward, no memorable setpieces, no brainless fun. Only a soulless step back after treyarch tried to make the series better in all of it's modes. The multiplayer? Play with bots. Trust me; it's WAY more fun that way. Otherwise, the maps suck, the weapons suck and of course; it's full of cheaters with perks that AREN'T POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE!!! Extinction? It's boring. A good idea to the same level that a staple gun is better in a office setting. But what about the horde mode? It's just bots. No the same AI that runs enemies from the MW3 horde mode. These bots are cheap, too. They WILL knife you if your even breathing distance and screw up your WHOLE game.  Bottomline; stay away. As a fan of the COD series; this makes my blood boil that I bothered to drop 48 on launch day for it. I'm playing it less out of trying to have fun but more as a nesessity to get my money out of it...I'd take BO2 and MW3 any day and so should you. DO NOT BUY THIS DRECK!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I WANT MY F*****G MONEY BACK. Soo much lag you can't even play multiplayer. I'm done with COD
Call of Duty: Ghosts,RIP Call of Duty - worst ever in the franchise...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I haven't tried Multiplayer yet, but - while playable - there is still a fair amount of stuttering in single player. It doesn't seem to have to do with video card either, it just stutters. Less during game play than in the cut scenes though. The overall story is a bit too 'Merca for me, and then there are scenes that don't feel realistic at all. Like shooting guns under water and having to shoot ice with rockets. The dog is pretty impossible too. I spend too much time going WTF to be able to imerse myself into the game at all. The guns seem nice, so maybe multi player gameplay is fun? I don't know, I am too scared to even try because of the stutter. Maybe with some more patches it will improve. Either way, I feel like I made a huge mistake buying this game at only 33% off. Even Black Ops 2 was a major improvement over this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"TBH I'm quite disappointed with this game as far as the online multiplayer goes! (not tried the campain yet) Every time I play there is a hacker with a aimbot or wallhack spoiling it for everyone. As far as I can tell there doesn't seem to be anything been done about it!   Now the bugs in the graphics, sometimes randomly after picking up an enemyâ€™s gun the whole screen flickers black (basically totally blind) and also randomly my gun will start to grow random black spikes around my barrel!! WTF!  I was going to buy the hardened edition which comes with the season pass included but decided to get the season pass a bit later after playing and learning the standard maps first. I'm glad I chose that option now!!!  BOTTOM LINE... FIX THE BUGS AND STOP THE HACKERS! Then I will buy the season pass! As for recommending this game, probably not.. well not yet!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is crap worst cod ever
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i do not recommend this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,don't buy this its a waste of money for the PC you get ton of crashes lag and more..........
Call of Duty: Ghosts,honestly i paid 60 bucks for this game and cant get passed 3rd level of story cuz it constantly crashes its full of bugs. it has a lackluste story with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest ending ever. the multiplayer is good if ur 1 of the lucky few it doesnt crash with mine crashes within 2 minutes of playing. MY RATING IS 3/10 THIS GAME SUX NVR AGAIN WILL BUY A COD FROM INFINITY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ FOR PC EVER AGAIN THEY STOLE MY MONEY THEY CAN GO SCREW THEMSELVES!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player game brings some new fun if you like this type of game but the online experience is still full of cheaters so maybe ignore the onine part and buy the game for 10 if it ever sells for that i see it up for 60 as of now and thats without the 5 or so expansions that allways come with this type of game all in all very very minus dont buy for multiplayer oh unless youre one of the hackers...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD ghosts......... what a shame, seriously, I used to be a fan of COD since the franchise started, I liked all of the titles, even the ill fated MW3. I used to think that every game, in any successful franchise, should have a different 'taste': Will it be a new story line, a novel character customisation scheme, a somewhat different gameplay, or even the addition of a DOG (e)........ until I bought GHOSTS. it had all of that, but im in a very VERY depressingly bad way (graphics suck, really, guns are, with some exceptions, boring to death and the storyline in SP is one o the worst offline experienses i ever had) if you are planning to break up with your GF/BF before christmase, buy them GHOSTS......"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Boring story, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC port, bad graphics. First COD I regret buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pretty bad port to pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,multiplayer is a let down bag in game lag
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game seems great but for all the hacks that are around, like some of the bigger maps and perks. Edited this to the game has turned to crap, it's a shame"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont buy this game its a crap game ...MW4 its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game ...... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them who made this game......
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recently transitioned to PC gaming and I have to say this game is not worth $60. I have an FX 8350 @ 4.4GHz, 8GB of G-SKILL Sniper @ 1600MHz and 2 GTX 760s on SLI (not bragging, but I think it's a decent build) and this game runs like crap. I own Metro: Last Light, which is a very graphics intensive game, and I can play almost maxed out. COD: Ghosts? If I attempt to max out the graphics it will go to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I would rather recommend Battlefield 4 instead of this garbage. I should have read all the reviews before buying."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"WORST CALL OF DUTY OF ALL TIME !!  First of all , I aint a BF fanboy but an experienced COD player who played it since 2005 on every titles it has on PC. Before this COD was released I didnt set my hope up too high , but didnt expect it to be bad either because Infinity ward never let the fans down before.  The Pros  -Singleplayer (Mediocore , yes but I got no choice but to fill this in)  -New Extinction mode (At least it's new)  -'Create a Soldier' function in multiplayer  The Cons  -Bad Optimization for PC   -6 GB of Ram , 66 GB of HDD spcaces are needed (For this garbage , seriously ?)  -Mouse lag in Menu page.  -Outdated graphic which share the similarity to a game from 2009 - 2010 (Made me wanna know where did that 66 GB go? because the texture sucks ball )   -Bad Voice acting both in singleplayer and multiplayer. Hear some stuff from the Multiplayer Announcers and you will know that I meant.  -No more Ping indicator !!! , in FPS (multiplayer) gaming ,We need to know / aware of our ping all the time , Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did you remove it ??  -Sound system sucks , every ... EVERY guns sound like a low grade firecracker, like those low budget games. Maybe on par to Black ops 1.  -Worst map design ever , there is no fun !! , This is a downfall of IW in map developing.  -Instant crash (Blue screen , Black screen , Green artifects) in multiplayer for many user (me too w/ green artifects) espacially those with 'Nvidia' graphic card  -Boring Killstreak rewards , many of them are â€˜stupidâ€™  Call of duty : RUBBISH  4.5 / 10  *Another reminder , Go read my other recommendations on COD I always gave it a nice score, Iâ€™m a fans but this one is an absolute trash."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"unfortunately this game could have been alot better in my opinion. They have moved from 12 man teams to 6 man teams which I believe is them attempting to go towards an esport route rather than competing against bf4. Understanding the loadout system took a while to learn as well as it is not user friendly, the grenades and tatical items will also take some getting used to as they do not conform to realism i.e. motion detector which you start with does not show them on your mini map but instead will explode like a mine and then allow you to see them through walls for a brief period of time. Killstreaks have also changed in this game some for the better and some for the worse but this will be more of a personal opinion. Game requirements have recently been lowered so that is a major improvement. Maps while it was said they were larger in reality they are still the size best suited for run and gun playstyle than sniper nests and the enviroment is more suited for constant movement rather than 'camping' an area or section of the map. However on the other hand the maps have several layers to them 2-3 most of the time so they have more depth and passageways to areas so creating a choke point is much more difficult. In this respect the maps could be considered larger.  Overall this game feels like more of an updated version of counter-strike where you have a small team to complete your objective. The responsiveness of the game is still very good but suffers from the lack of a server it still uses the p2p system."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Glitchy as hell, even with the patch. Stuttering and freezes in both single and multi play. Wait for the patch that fixes this issue before you buy. You have been warned. PS to Infinity Ward.....Shame on you.....Shame on you twice.....shame on you three times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game plays rubish DO NOT BUY FOR PC!!!!! It is locked at 60 frames and gets frames drops from 60 to 10 in seconds 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,people think the games bad because you have barily no health not a good game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is already awful but now they are trying to suck people back in to the game with a free skin pack and a dog reskin, if they made the season pass was free i would maybe come back but not very likely"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is Call of Duty. It is likely you have already played it before. Not much has changed.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is pure garbage from top to bottom biggest waste of money th wolf dlc doesnt even work.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Player count on multiplayer never exceeds more than like... 3500 people. The game is graphically unoptimized and looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even though your rig may be able to handle other games on their most maxed out settings. Its a rather poor port, and its sad that the all mighty and more powerful pc is made to run this game like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because this game company is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy to optimize and port this game from the console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Hi,  I would not advise ppl to buy the game in the current state. All the bugs make the game unplayable at certain stages. Memory leaks during loading screens, freezes in game, blue screens of death,.....  Then there's also the crappy FOV and the rly mediocre storyline, no anticheat in multi,...  Do yourself a favor and wait to buy and download this (28GB) game until IW does something about it. Right now i'd give it a 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Major stuttering and performance issues that make it almost unplayable and have not been fixed 3 months after release. Aside from that its a good game that I actually would enjoy if the aforementioned problems were patched. Hopefully Infinity Ward will put some effort into fixing its product's shortcomings
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is feeled in a alpha phase of an alpha phase... The Multiplayer is only playable at VERY LOW settings and the singleplayer is way worster. It is unplayable lagging and the cutscenes are lagging like hell. I swear i took the double of time i would need to finish this game cause the laggs. it is lagging so heavy i dont got the story in my mind and my extern soundcard is crashin everytime. I was a big fan of COD but this was the last COD i will purchased ever. YOU think my system is garbage and this is the problem? then have a look:  MB: ASUS ROG Crosshair Formula V CPU: AMD FX-8350 @ 4.1 RAM: GSkill 16GB 1600MHz GPU1: AMD Radeon HD 7990 6GB (Gigabyte) GPU2: Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 1.2GB (Gigabyte) HDD1:Seagate 320GB 7200RPM (System) HDD2: Seagate 1000GB 7200RPM (Games) OS:Windows 7 Home Premium 64x  If i look on the 'Recommended' my system would play this EASY on MAX settings if this game has not got programmed from Babies  Recommended (14.01.2014)  OS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit  CPU: IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5 â€“ 680 @ 3.6GHz  RAM: 8 GB RAM  HDD : 40 GB HD space  Video: NVIDIAÂ® GeForceâ„¢ GTX 760 @ 4GB  Sound: DirectXÂ® compatible sound card  DirectXÂ®: DirectXÂ® 11  Internet: Broadband connection and service required for Multiplayer Connectivity.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Really dissapointing game. Don't recommend to anyone. This has clearly gone to console and is not ideal for PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not good, only hacker... ):"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maps, to easy to die, spawns are the worst i have ever played in any game. worst COD ever!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty game to date.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is extremely unstable and 'laggy' in comparison to single-player.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ guns kill to quick and boaring 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,dont buy this game it is the most poorly optimised game i have ever played i cant even play the game half the time because of lag and frame rate drops and i've tried everything to fix this problem so until something is done to fix the problem i stand by my reveiw please heed my warnings
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you play this game on PC as i do you are going to be frustrated trying to find a game. So many times I'm sitting there waiting to get into a game and I'm not just talking about the less popular game modes...even TDM and Dom i have troubles. Now if you try to get into a game with more than 2 people squaded up, good luck. Usually two of us have to go into a game and third person will have to join after and hope he gets on our team which most of the time does not happen. I do like the bigger maps and the graphics look better. New game modes are really nice too but i never get to play them because not enough people play them. If we had true dedicated servers with a server browser like COD 4 it would make joining games so much easier. There would be servers dedicated for the less popular game modes that you can always join and actually play. This would also bring down the ridiculous amount of cheaters in this game. I never seen a game with more cheaters that go unpunished and actually brag about it in the game. If you NEED to play a COD game while your waiting for Treyarchs usual better game (BO 2 has more people playing than Ghosts) then go ahead and get this game. If you can wait i say get BF4 which i had problems with at first but recent updates has allowed me to enjoy the game without any issues now. Now that's an awesome game. DICE &gt; Infinity Ward"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If it wern't for the cheaters and the lack of anti cheat support from Activision and Infinit Ward, this would be a pretty good game. As long as you don't mind frame rate drops, lag issues, lack of server choices and just a screw you attitude from the developers, then I could recommend this game other wise I have to say NO WAY should anyone buy this game. I think a large lawsuit is needed"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BUG, LAG, CHEATERS ! Get my money back !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game, totally waste your money. I've bought this game for a month and still can't launch, crash immediately after launch!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever dont buy it .. go for bf4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game. IW seems to have failed in properly making good textures for 'next gen' appeal. As far as PC is concerned, graphics is definitely not a selling point. Jagged edges and unfinished looking objetcs in the world steal the immersion that I was expecting.  Let us now talk about multiplayer. The CoD franchise has done little to change things up, a tired engine being used again and again with a few tweaks (such as being able to slide and lean around cover). For me in particular, the biggest game changer is the lack of heavy hitting, high risk/high reward killstreaks. The AC-130 is gone. Instead, a Helo Pilot killstreak attempts to take its spot, and it fails miserably. Piloting it feels as though the game does it for me and the weapons equipped are lack luster; the shock and awe is just not there.  The one good change is the emphasis on gunplay. Since killstreaks do far less, it is now more in the hands of the player to play the objective and rely on gunplay with tactics to win and do well.  As for the single player, it is a roller coaster. High thrill moments at times marred by moments when the game does too much for you. Not enough choices in the campaign to influence any outcomes, your squad mates do much of the heavy lifting for you, and many times the cinematic cutscenes allow little to no interaction. I do not like just sitting and watching a video game being played for me, IW.  I give this game a 4.5/10. There is much to be desired and it often feels like a free to play game - a bad one.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont Buy this ! Period ! BBF4 is a Fu**** beast compared to this ! If it drop under 20$ dont even think about it and buy Killing floor ! Its more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than RainbowSix Vegas 1 !  For me Vegas 1 was the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥est game ever made ! But this top it pretty badly !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Barely playable multiplayer, And I have 4 gigs of video ram, 6 gigs of ram, and a 3.1 ghz processor. Lowest graphic settings, and it still stutters. Ill just go back to play Far Cry 3 on ultra. XD I wish I could get my money back. This game is a joke until they re-develop it for PC gamers..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is like modern warfare 2's older brother. the specifications are way above what it should be and yes the game will give you some laggspike even when you got a beast pc. you need 8gb of ram, there's no FOV meter so you will get a headache in a few minutes and you need 64 bit windows or else it wont run the game (like it did with me) game is no the best they made but the story mode is pretty good. multiplayer is just as fun in modern warfare 2 or 3 only with a few more gamemodes.  4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"pass this over real fast,waste of money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"[SP: 6.7/10, MP: 3/10, Extinctionn: 6/10] Extinctionn is way too easy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why oh why did I spend this money...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is full of cheaters
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infinity ward needs to go to a psych ward if they think their going to be able to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on PC gamers like this again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Wating for steam to add a trading function so i can sell this garbage
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have some issues with lagging in this game, I sometimes disconnect from the servers. I do not recommend this game as there are to many hackers in multiplayer, and not well optimized for PC. Anyways, I recommend to get Battlefield 4 instead."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Having bought this game with high expectations of some changes that would breathe life into the yearly installations, I was sorely dissapointed. Poor optimization, Extreme lag issues and the hackers! Woe is me the Hackers. The game had so much promise, but a lack of proper moderation and care have ruined the game. I regret purchasing this 'game' and its season pass."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The singleplayer is still fun to play on Veteran, but the multiplayer is.. f*cking unbalanced to say. The skill gap is really low. 99% of the maps are pure â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  I'll be waiting for sledgehammer's cod, it'll be hopefully nice and competitive."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player is quite good but the multiplayer is a bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The rediculous number of hackers and the overall gameplay experience isnt great for the average gamer.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To much lag
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Didn't take long for the hackers to get around. Dedicated servers so they can be kicked from the server would be nice. I like the range of game modes. Don't play multiplayer much due to lag and hackers.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst Call Of Duty game ever made. save your money if you are on the fence about making this purchase.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Extremely dissapointed. My computer specs are well within recommended range and it will not run the campaign unless I turn off shadows and lower a bunch of graphical settings. The game coding is pretty sloppy, and the visuals fall far behind what it claimed it would be. MW3 was aceptable, but this new bare skeleton of a storyline combined with an obvious lack of effort on the developer's part is starting to turn me off from the CoD series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another step backwards honestly, as much as they boast a new game engine it's the same arcade shoot-from-the-hip game; and that's ignoring the fact that they spat in the face of PC gamers with what the released as a finished product."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Although this is one of the best COD I have ever played, it an unoptimized mess. The singleplayer is fine, kind of.., but the multiplayer is...bleh. Online lobbies always lag, hit detection sometimes doesn't even happen and lag compensation (don't even get me started on that) just ruin the whole game for me.  Untile these issues are properly fixed, I just can't recommend this game: it's way too unoptimized."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If your'e looking for a good multiplayer game. I don't really recommend this one to get. Single player's fun but just the multiplayer and the lag. extinction good but it just getting boring doing the same objective over and over again over all rate this game  MultiPlayer SinglePlayer  4/10 6/10  but still don't recommend this game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the poor version of call of duty. Infinity ward sucks, rinse and repeat but this time they tried to rip off battlefield. I won't be buying another infinity ward CoD game, Treyarch are the innovators. I would not reccommend if you like fast paced action with a pick up and play arcade feel."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible optimization, if it could even be named as such. Core performance issues and gameplay balance. Strongly advising against the purchase of the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I cant believe they even sold this game on PC. Admittedly, my PC isnt the best, but BLOPS2 and Skyrim run on it, no issue. Dont waste money on this game"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Some of the boards are to big and the others get old fast. This is one that if you have to get it, get it off the clearance rack."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please don't buy this garbage anymore. They honestly didn't even try with this title, especially when it came to the PC version."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,play it a while. i love the lone wolf play style in call of duty since first modern warfare but lack of dedicated server makes this game an awesome garbage. don't buy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i didn't like it the call of duty series keeps getting worse and worse with each game #mw2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you dont have a very high end gaming computer even with the graphics on low your fps will drop, i also think that the alien mode in ghost is pretty dumb compared to our usual zombies, so all in all i would not get this game,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ppl pleases dont buy this garabage even if its on sell to many STUPID HACKERS on day one n still steam and IW wont do anything bout it.They try sell DLC how bout stop them â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no skills hacker before suckering me out of more money &gt;:( This going be my last COD im moving on to bf4 yes i know there crashes n bugs but theres no noob hackers n they been working on fixing them unlike IW bs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,biggest piece of crap every regurgetated out of infinity ward. the talent that was there during cod 4 is clearly long gone and hasnt been there since. DONT BUY THIS GAME WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY NOTHING IS DIFFERENT NOTHING REVOLUTIONARY. Bottom line is COD has peaked and is on the decline this is the proof. Hate bf4 but looks like i will be playin that instead
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fix the game for PC players!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Definitely the WORST Call of Duty yet.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hack fest..game died quickly onlne...R.I.P. Infinityward
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The biggest disappointment this Year was defently this motherf***ing game the first week i had to look trough the different gamer forums to adjust my config_mp to run that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game properly with a i7 3,4GHz and a GTX660 and 16GB RAM installed with most of the Settings on low. Then the developers started not fixing the game, nooooooo they got that great idea making more money with people who supported them for years and made that wolf â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ skin what nobody needs instead of getting that game fixed. Its betrayal on all the supports of Call of Duty over the Years who made the developers rich fat and obviously dull. Thank u for that load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No server policing makes the game no fun gotta get rid of the CHEATERS.....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would recommend this game if they ACUTALLY did something about the hackers instead of letting them run free. Good game, but hackfest 2014."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I can't even get 12 players to start a match, yet Steam keeps trying to sell COD Ghost add-ons."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is possibly the worst cod ever, awfull netcode, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balancing and lame performances (it doesnt even play smooth with medium settings on a nvidia gtx680 with 4gb of video memory) ensure one of the most umiliating cod experience ever.. get back to blops2 or mw3 and dont bother with this crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this game a lot more than most people whose reviews I've read. However, there are a lot of issues with it that need to be fixed. The multiplayer has a few good maps for whatever play style you want. Snipe, check. Run and gun, check. Camp like an â™¥â™¥â™¥, check. Riot shield, sure. But the spawns for every map are terrible. I can't count how many times I've spawned in front of an enemy and been shot immediately. Frequently drops frames, especially when I scope in with a sniper. Balancing the teams is also terrible between matches. Hackers are a pretty big issue every so often. Single player was better than the last two Treyarch games and only slightly better than that of MW3. Until the multiplayer issues are fixed, I really wouldn't strongly recommend the game to anyone else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a hacked out, laggy, glitching, POS...do not give them your money! No support for IW/activision ever again from me. You want a COD title stick to black ops franchise and Treyarch."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Very poor console port. Don't buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,65 FOV. Do I need to say more?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst 70$ ive EVER spent.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poor performance, Multiplayer noob friendly, maps too big for the standards of COD. I really don't like this game. If you want â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, buy this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just wasted 40Â£ on this =/ LAAAAG
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The single player version is very short when compared to previous versions. Multiplayer is a hackers paradise. This game is maybe worth $20 for the single player and a the 10% chance that you get in a multiplayer game with no hackers but anything beyond that is a waste.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single player is quick and easy on all but the hardest level. Lots of lag during the intro videos and I have a high end machine... Multi-player is awful, already full of cheats and hacks. most types of maps cannot be played because there are simply not enough players in the lobbys to start games. Too bad, some of the upgrades over previous COD games look good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I miss setting up your own server, playing on dedicated larger maps. This spray and pray stuff is getting old. Running around the pvp maps like a moron, shooting everything in hopes of getting a kill. Winning depends on who has the better ping. Plus add to that you would think they would have been able to get control of all these people cheating, wall, target and other hacks. The game is really a waste of money. If they get better, larger maps, along with dedicated servers for setting up your own game I might looking into buying this franchise again. Until then, this game is dead to me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"don't buy it, MP is unplayable, full of hackers, Infinity Ward and Activision just don't care at all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,just get BO2 far better in every way
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Simply the worst FPS ever made in the franchise. Why do they characters have super human abilities and dont die?  I wased my money on this crap and I have already uninstalled it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not to many players online at all mostly around 5k ppl. Pretty much the same as all of the other CODs... sadly
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I honestly felt that Ghosts' multiplayer was a huge disappointment compared to MW3, and the reason I'm comparing Ghosts with MW3 is because Black Ops 2 is not made by IF. Going to back to the multiplayer topic, this has been one of the rare case scenarios where a Call Of Duty game has a campaign better than the multiplayer. I hereby rate multiplayer 4 out of 10 and the campaign 7 out of 10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One word: Headache  Not optimized well for PC...at ALL,nor was it worth the money, I should have bought BF4 or GTAV, I would have gotten more. The multiplayer doesn't even work with bots, thats right, it takes minutes to load one game with all bots, framerate issues throughout, even with a good graphics card, its running like crap. While the campaign wasn't as bad as most are saying, the rest feels like the team of IW couldn't have cared less about the PC. Also, graphics still haven't been improved, with all settings on high/extra, it still looks bad due to the outdated CoD engine, seriously, the last time I buy a CoD game. I'll be talking to steam about getting a refund and getting a good game, or maybe just save the credit until Destiny come out for PC.   3/10: A Dissapointment   P.S. To all of you whose think I might be a huge fanboy of another shooter and made this up, I want you to know I own ALL the CoD's except for BO2 (i traded in) I tried to give them another chance, but this is the last time I will buy the same thing."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game crashes constantly. have tried hundreds of times to play the campaign but the glitches and crashes are so frusterating I finally gave up. I tried multiplayer and had the same issue. Updates and patches did not made any difference. I never expected the game to be perfect. But considering I paid 60 bucks for it, I did expect it to run. When I play the game I get random freezes, low FPS, and shuttering until finally the game refuses to respond and crashes. This will always happen between 2-10 minutes of gameplay. I have never played this game for more than 10 minutes without it crashing. So disappointed, complete waste of my money.   And just to prove that my system is not at fault here, my specs : CPU- 1090T @4.1 Ghz  GPU- Radeon R9 280x RAM- G.skill 8GB (1866)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A shell of it's former self. Multiplayer seems more balanced, but at the same time it makes the gameplay stale (not that the gameplay is that much different). The maps in this game just seem to be a whole bunch of rubbish thrown together. A lot of destruction and clutter. I don't even think there is a map aside from the castle map that doesn't have debris and clutter everywhere. The campaign is just as inspiring as the map design in the game, which isn't saying much at all. Been there, done that. All too many times..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I got this game as the first CoD game since the original CoD Modern Warfare hoping it would be a blast. That has sadly not been the case. It may look great on a console or a stacked PC, but on my humble rig with an ivy bridge i5, 16 GB of ram and a 2 year old video card this game just looks terrible. I have played other games on this same PC that looked much, much better to the point where it is difficult to play. Multiplayer is still fun, but just as ugly as the single player. I am sure in 6 months when they release some more patches to better optimze for the PC it will get better. I guess we will see."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute faecal matter, No anti-cheat for online play, and the single player is a copy and paste from the previous. My apologies they added a fookin dog to make things interesting. Go home COD youâ€™re drunk."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sucks, but w/e"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,horrible game the pc version is really messed up its practically unplaable only the console versions play well they apparently dont know how to develope for the pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To many cheats and nothing done about it. To much Lagg and spoiles the game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"very Disappointing game, the graphics are Terrible and the story is weird, I thought that this will be a good game but now thanks to ghosts i will never buy another call of duty game because they all are the same thing. activision,if you want the next call of duty to succeed, do better graphics, and better story. i think the multiplayer will be better with larger maps,new mods and no hackers"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Still not fixed after 6 months, many graphical glitches, and stuttering. The campaign was pretty good, and took around 8 hours on veteran. I had to fight graphic glitches throughout it to be able to finish it. The game could be good, but it seems like they do not want to fix it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game has it's fair share of performance problems and to be honest call of duty games in general have not been worth anything since back in the day when call of duty united offensive came out which still has more people online to this day than in CoD ghosts which tell you how much this game sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game took the same CoD storyline, and made it Brazilian, this only involves the campaign. In the multiplayer there is a lot more options that can be taken advantage of at an early level, but beyond that the maps are remenicent of other CoDs and the graphics actually seemed to be worse than is predecesser Black Ops II. I personally did not think the extermination even came close to the zombies from Black Ops I and II. Overall it is an okay game, but it seems like a downgrade from the previous CoD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm sorry but this game kind of sucks. Doesn't feel right. I feel disconnected from the player. I gave it a try.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sadly the game still has cheaters, performance problems and a really low player base. Its still a reasonable good game if you can get past all those problems."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just avoid Activision and Infinity Ward.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always loved call of duty --- but they NEED to make this game more PC-friendly. Even the most powerful gaming rigs have issues -- it was poorly ported to PC, mainly made for consoles -- this is clear"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"-no anticheat -they banned people for using fov-changer and later added a 65-80Â° option (like joke to mess with the people who wanted 90Â° since mw2) -client-hosting (lag fest); no dedicated servers (again?!) -poor performance, 90fps cap; i get 3x more fps in BO2 at all highest settings  this is basically a technical failure with 50% hackers.  0/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,too much lag. too long to start game. too many hackers. the worst game ever. i am getting an xbox. i think the poor standards shown on this game and the lack of support should warrant a full refund to all players but not the hackers who are helping to kill this game totally. I cannot say it loud enough THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"wow... just wow... played MW1, WAW, MW2, Blackops, MW3, Blackops2 all on console... alot... Terrible PC game!! If you really want a COD for pc, then get Blackops 2. Ghosts is a terrible...terrible crappy port that obviously wasn't made to be a good pc game. Console version of Ghosts is a lot better, but I would personally recommend other games(which I'm not going to name)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Shame on them to make such an unoptimized game in 2014. Why did they have to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it up on PC ? No one care about the PC community anymore ? All you care about is cosoles because thats where the majority play ? Well, GJ, you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up. Big time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst graphics of ALL cod games..Despite ALL the complaints, they have NO CONTROL over hackers what so ever..IF THEY WOULD GIVE US THE DEDICATED SERVERS WE WANTED, THEN WE COULD GET RID OF THEM...So for 70.00 bucks, save your money and take your family out to dinner !!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,please check if it does not meet the minimum requirements DO NOT BUY  Minimum System Requirements   OS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit  CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 2.66 GHZ / AMD Phenom X3 8750 2.4 GHZ or better  RAM: 6 GB RAM  HDD: 40 GB HD space  Video: NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450 / ATI Radeon HD 5870 or better  Sound: DirectX Compatible Sound Card  DirectX: 11  Internet: Broadband Internet connection and Steam and Online Multiplayer
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game crash all the time !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is not bad if with out (hack)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is just like any other COD games ported to PC except the fact that they failed to port this game successfully. The graphics can't be maxed out really and there is a lot of lag issues.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Flappy bird is better then this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,my game freezes in story mode
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game with the worst optimisation the world has ever known. My computer runs bf4 on medium grafs with 60fps and this game 30fps, and the game has nothing special to show for the pover usage"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I knew better than to buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. As always, it's broken. Frame rate drops damn near everytime I get into a firefight despite my more than capable PC. If that isn't bad enough, it is INFESTED with hackers. I can not go ONE SINGLE game, without having to deal with aimbot, invulnerability, and the like. This is BY FAR the WORST game I have EVER spent any amount of money on. I wouldn't get this garbage if it were free, and my life depended on it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horribly unoptimized garbage.  Some missions the sound cut out half way through, others bluescreened loading.   I don't care about the FOV (I use default) I don't even mind the poor texturing.  What I DO mind, is that, they dare call a game where 40% of its install (Theoreticaly) is Xbox emulator, Complete and ready for release.   Don't buy this game, wait for treyarchs next title in the series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is just god awfull... the only reason i bought it was to play with my friend who also bought it. To this day we have only played one game together. the only reason I still ocassionaly play it is because i blew 30$ on this terrible game. please, do NOT ignore the reviews!!! this game is absolutely terrible and a waste on money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To sum this all up, this is simply Call Of Duty: Black Ops II version 0.5. Luckily I got this game as a free gift because I know an Activision employee, but free still doesn't excuse this free scat of a 'game'.  Once again COD got dragged-down by the console ports. There are no dedicated servers, no software development kit, no developer console. The graphics are ancient and the file size is obese. There is no zombies mode, no spec ops mode, no campaign co-op mode, and no 4-player split screen mode. The flaws of the horrible Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare are still being used in this game, pistol shooting through a foot of concrete wall to kill an enemy with 1 shot and the wall doesn't even break, seeing all enemies on radar all the time in multiplayer (now you know you can not see radar from the naked eye when you're not in a vehicle if you were in a real life warzone). And did I mention the lag?! This game is epic LAG LAG LAG!!!  So yea, don't buy this scat, save it for the 2 girls with the 1 cup. Activision won't stop ripping off customers until customers make a stand, so let's unite and boycott COD:Ghosts, and the upcoming failures; COD:2014, COD:2015, COD:2016, and so forth. Save the annual games for WWE, EA Sports, and 2K Sports, not Call Of Football 2014, or save your hard-earned cash for some indie games, most indie developer gives much more of a damn about their customers than Activision does."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the end of cod ill never buy again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,First Call of Duty I did not enjoy playing... It's just terrible...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,ITS CRAP
Call of Duty: Ghosts,TOO MANY HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU NEED TO CHECK EACH IP FOR CORRECT FILES BEFORE THEY JOIN THE SERVERS!!!! A SIMPLE CHECK WOULD STOP THE HACKERS!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is so laggy. You disapoint me steam fix it!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Wast of money Dont buy, I have a i7-quad core at 3.8ghz and a GTX 660, I cant play on ultra and there are fram drops, I play battlefiled 4 on ultra at 120 fps, meaning cod is very badly ported for the PC, I cant play the campain nor the multiplayer, If you want ghosts get a ps4...end of story"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where to start? ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!   The game itself is fun, on console. The claimed 60fps rate is a lie, the game crashes every three seconds (so far haven't gotten to play more than three seconds at a time), and I'm more or less dissapointed with my choice to spend $60 on this.   Would I suggest this on PC as a gift? Maybe to someone I hate.   If I get it working right I'll change my review. As of right now this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  *UPDATE!* This game is worse than laggy, it is ouright unplayable with no updates or fixes in sight. Infinity Ward and Activision should be ashamed of themselves for selling out so badly as to realase this unfinished, unplayable, bloodorgy of lag. Even with over 7gb RAM, AMD A8-3500M processor, and Radeon HD graphics card ( a system I regularly play BF4, Skyrim, with graphics set on ultra and running multiple graphics mods by the way, COD4, and Blackops 2) this game is impossible to play. Un-freaking-acceptable. Untill you fix this game you should stop selling it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So whats to say about a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? not much at all. If your looking for a good call of duty go back to World at War just please don't buy this game. It is unoptimized as hell with stuttering on every single part of the game. Textures don't pop in half the maps unless you are running at extra texture resolution setting.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is by far the worst FPS title i have played in years. Not only has COD not changed since MW4, it has been plauged by unbalanced gameplay. Getting knifed shortly after shooting multiple shots into your opponents chest is getting quite old. problems that surround COD games are issues that have been in place since the beginning. COD is a genuine cash cow that i will not support any longer. Sad, but i must move on."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is extremely laggy and almost unplayable. Infinity Ward...... FIX YA GAME!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Insanely bad stuttering, sadly it cant even reach its own 'CoD' standards..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's call of duty. A bad game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no need to buy blops 2 is better and that game still sucked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pros: The name  Cons: Every thing  1/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Black ops 2 was WAY better and Infinity ward does not seem to care for PC Gamers one bit. However the game is fun, but after spending 20 hours into the multiplayer and 30 hours in total the game gets boring and a waste of your money. The game also chrashes ALL The time. Infinity ward.... All hope is lost for you, Treyarch are the leaders in this franchise now.... 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campaign is fun enough - but if you're a fan of the Call of Duty series the multiplayer is a horrible broken mess (mechnically and buggy) that will only end in frustration. Better sticking with one of the older titles you haven't played yet.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In a market where the gaming dollar is strecthed thinner everyday. Activision has released what feels like an incomplete insult to the gaming community.   I have never been the largest COD player, I surely fall into the casual section for this titles but none the less I have played all the predecessors and while not all have been perfect gems none have been a complete lump of coal like this one.   Poorly optimized, bad balancing, boring story, and just a lackluster effort all together,   In the end thats what turns me off the most is that in this Market Activision feels that we MUST buy COD. so their doesn't seem to be any effort.   COD Ghosts 1/5   Check out my other reviews and add me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well all I can say is just please don't ever buy this game, a month after release it is still unplayable. I have a pretty decent pc (can run blops 2 pc on high settings at 120fps) yet this game on low settings struggles to hit 40 frames. Their are no dedicated pc options whatsoever, no fov slider, dedicated peak around corner keys, no true dedicated servers (disgracefully slow server, p2p hybrid bs), 60GB install file for a game which even on the highest settings still doesn't look overly special - just a few more shades of brown and grey. The gameplay itself is the slowest in the franchise, with the worst spawn point system conceivable in a game. Wish I had seen reviews of this game before (ie the modal score of 0/10 on the metacritic website). So yeah, last time I give these crooks any money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Total pile of wank game. Looks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gameplay. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. The last decent CoD game was Black Ops 1. Now they are just getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥irer and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier. I'm done. See you on Battlefield.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I get random crashes
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am not a huge fan of Call of Duty anymore, but this game is just awful.  They some how managed to remove many features that they added in the previous game, as well as give the game worse textures.  Not only that, but the game runs horrible. Online is also very unplayable and laggy.  I would highly suggest not buying this game. It's not worth it. It needs so much work to be playable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single Player While I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign story, the gameplay itself however is very simple. The game holds your hand throughout the levels leaving very little room for you to find/figure things out on your own.  Multiplayer The multiplayer is like every other CoD game, few enhancements, minor tweaks, lots of bugs, many people complaining. The initial start off was, and probably still is, plagued by bloated MIN requirements, constant FPS drops despite having a decent rig, aimbots/wallhacks/boosters, random CTD's and no dedicated servers. There are a handful of people that have gotten lucky and don't have any issues running the game though.  Overall, there are too many problems with Ghosts right now to consider this a good buy. I'm glad I bought this game at a deep discount but still regret spending $35 for it. 6/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not worth the purchase, too laggy, disrupts the gameplay a lot and the requirements should not be that high for this game! Multiplayer is useless with the lag and the terrible method of not using DEDICATED servers!!! I can not stress the point enough that player based hosting is the most annoying thing on this planet! Connecting to friends isn't great either at the moment, about 45% friends I can not join in a party but I can join them if I search for a lobby and join, it's useless! The campaign is much better and I enjoyed it thoroughly, easy to catch onto story line with a good number a characters to play as always. Extinction is good too, with a similar style mode to zombies but it's nice to have change and an ending too!  I do not recommend purchasing copy at this moment in time due to multiplayer problems! Otherwise 6/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its ok def not what it was hyped up to be. battlefield 4 far surpasses cod ghosts in both graphics and gameplay. and i was a die hard cod fan untill this. i lost all faith in infinity ward and hope that they get it right sooner or later and stop remaking the same game over and over and over and over again. will not buy the next COD game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's a shame that CoD is becoming more than a game, it's now a 'Franchise' The latest incarnation has the feel of a very expensive map pack rather than a complete game worthy of they hype. It is in no way optimised for PC. The textures are low quality. Playing at 2560 x 1440 is...........well lets just sat underwhelming.  The Single player campaign is a rather drab dull afair with the challenges being almost spoon fed to you in an extremeley linear expereince. Overall I would rate the game, at best 5.5 out of 10. Wait for it in a Steam sale than taking this Xmas Turkey at full price."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well done Infinity Ward... you have managed to do it again... create a great game, and then refuse to truly support Dedicated Servers... stop porting console games to PC without real support. Perhaps pick it up cheap for the Single Player, but until IW get serious about the PC multiplayer experience I cant recommend this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always been a BIG fan of the CoD series for both campaign and multiplayer gameplay.  CoD Ghosts doesn't aim to set a higher standard over previous titles. In fact, it just feels the same.   **Spoiler ahead, you've been warned**  Presentation:  Been there, seen that. Scripted scenes here and there. Same gameplay mechanics for the last 7 years !  It's all the same whether you're in space, under water, on foot, tank, drone, A-10, Osprey, Apache, Zzz... The story was...wait, was there a story ?  The most memorable thing was the dog. Puppy! Don't let me started on the lousy drama !  Riley's (dog) death would have been a much more saddening event that papa ghost's (Elias) funny/funky death scene. It meant a lot for so many players losing 'SOAP' on the 3rd Modern Warfare 3 title, compared to a cheap death of a character that barely grew on you in Ghosts !  Gameplay: Very FEW memorable fights and scenes. Press F,E,G,N,V,Q,E RMB,LMB, Press both LMB + RMB ! What is this ? CoD or God of War ?  Visuals: If that's supposed to be next gen I wonder what Crysis 3 was all about.  i7 4770K + 32 GB Ram + dual GTX680 4GB in SLI with shadow/texture flickering plus frame rate drops. Disturbing ! Solution to shadow flickering ? Turn off SLI. Really ?!?!  Sound: Expect to hear many of the same things as in CoD MW1. (breath hold, grunt, grenade rolling...). Wasn't that game almost 7 years ago ? How can so many antagonists sound the same while holding their breath or falling of a 2 story building ?  The best part is when the credits start rolling. You'll feel delighted the nightmare is over ! Over all score ? 4/10   Highly disappointing !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont get this game just because its cheper. you should try it first.. For Singel player its very good.. multiplayer not so much.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game will not start for me single player or multi-player.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts epitomises, perfectly, the inescapable problems inherent in annual franchises and stands as the weakest Call of Duty game in the seriesâ€™ decade run. Itâ€™s a checklist, with Infinity Ward and Co. simply ticking the boxes to ensure that itâ€™s just like every other installment, minus the occasional bright sparks that set them apart. Thereâ€™s the snow level, the desert level, the stealth level, the bit where a playable character dies and 1,562 scripted explosions.  Not to even mention the horrific amount of bugs, glitches and just outright crashes in the game. And these aren't even small ones either. In some parts the sound is completely gone at other occasions the game doesn't register you walking past an checkpoint because you just are not another braindead idiot that doesn't recognise wich way the straight line towards the big end explosion is and then the AI will just stand there screaming at you that you have to get a move on it, while you're already a mile ahead stuck at an setpiece that is too damn dificult for your soldier that has recieved special forces training to move across (A door for instance, that isn't even bloody locked), wich in the end will result in an 'You have abandoned your mates' situation and you having to start over again.  Add the horrific support, poor framerate and optimisation and setpieces that have been recycled throughout the franchise since call of duty 4 (we are at iteration 10 now) and you know it is really bad.  Conclusion: Don't buy this game unless your an braindead animal that follows the media that has been bribed for millions of dollars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game is dead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Weapon sounds in space... oh my...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,About as much stealth as a elephant hiding behind a balde of grass.... well done COD u tricked me again
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its the worst cod i've played, really regret buying it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Ppl pleases dont buy this garabage even if its on sell to many STUPID HACKERS on day one n still steam and IW wont do anything bout it.They try sell DLC how bout stop them â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no skills hacker before suckering me out of more money &gt;:( This going be my last COD im moving on to bf4 yes i know there crashes n bugs but theres no noob hackers n they been working on fixing them unlike IW bs
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bad game , those companies like IW and Treyarch make the multiplayer worst with every Call of duty game that goes out .  1 . no servers .  2 . no Mods , for having a normal eSports Call of duty games like BO 1 and MW 1 was at the past time .  3 . The public get's worst because people still camping and it's not that good for the normal player being stacked with camper team mate , or being against a guy that camps ( not intresting game ) .  It's for IW and Treyarch !  MAKE THE NEXT GAME WITH MODS AND SERVERS , FOR THE ESPORTS LIKE ESL !  OR DON'T MAKE ANY CALL OF DUTY GAMES , BECAUSE IT'S TOO MAINSTREEM ALREADY !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I wasn't expecting much from a new call of duty game especially the COD's from IW (InfintyWard). There is nothing to be excited about at all in COD: Ghosts....the maps are awfully designed, weapons are unbalanced(as usual), Absolutely NO 'Dedicated Servers as advertised'(I figured from the start).  The story/campaign was decent but not as good as the MW series (ModernWarfare), graphics are better than previous COD's but not by much (considering they still use the same engine but just an enhanced version). The 'Extinction Mode' game mode is great addition and I find that I enjoy it alot more than Treyach's Zombies mode (which i could never really get into in the first place). But Extinction and Campaign alone cannot bring this game to be a well worth purchase especially at a $60 price point for such a horrible PC port. It has No FOV slider, 1 single volume slider, and is terribly optimised.  If your going to stick with the COD franchise, then I would highly recommend only buying the COD's from Treyarch since they actually make good PC ports and actually try to bring innovation to the franchise (same can definintly NOT be said for the COD's coming from InfinityWard). WHY: They have an FOV slider, Good volume option, and a good PC port that is actually optimised.  Call of Duty: Ghost Verdict: 5/10 'I'd say try harder next time Infinity Ward but, I doubt that they will.' Pros: +Story/campaign +Extinction Mode +Somewhat better graphics +Character customization  Cons: -Terrible PC port -No FOV slider -Not much volume options -Random FPS drops (Due to it being badly optimised) -Unbalnced weapons -Low amount of players through out the day to play other game modes (other than TDM,DOM,GW)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,You get stuck on the mission 'End of the line' so it sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible Bug !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crash... Crash... Crash...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DLC useless, refund?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worse CoD in years. Skip this one and play Advanced Warfare. 4/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Steam says I have played this a total of 33 minutes, but that's not correct. You see, it has crashed every time I've started it - never played a single mission. Support from the developer is nonexistant. No more steam or activision stuff for me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,would rec but the game is is very laggy and well full of hackers witch every one knows this the only good part of the game is the alien battle and the ability to play with friends in sqauds. I would not rec buying unless you caught it on sale for cheap then buy it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game itself is good, but on pc , the only games you can easily get into are deathmatch and domination REGULAR mode. which does get boring fast. if there were more people on the other game modes it would be a thumbs up from me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign: Too short, but is the only next-gen thing about the game. 7/10 Multiplayer: Awful. 4/10 Squads: Very good, would be better if in another game. 8/10 Extinction: Okay. Either you like it or you don't. 6/10 Overall Innovation: The Create-A-Soldier and prestige system is my favorite of any game yet, but the rest of the game is 'meh'. 5/10 Graphics: I'm not a 'GRAPHICS ARE EVERYTHING RAWR' person, but seriosuly, couldn't be a LITTLE better? 5/10  AVERAGE SCORE: about 5.8/10  If it's on sale, money is no object, or you love CoD and have to get it, buy it. If not, then don't.  The first two DLC packs weren't great, but the last two were my fav. Either get the last two or, if you love Extinction, get the season pass.  P.S.  Oh yeah and BTW, it says I have 6 hours, that's for campaign. I have over 70 hours on Multiplayer, but it doesn't show that in the review because multiplayer pops up as a different game in Steam. If you have another modern CoD you probably know what I'm talking about."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After two playthroughs (separated by over a year), this game still suffers from horrible PC performance issues (i.e. extremely poor optimization). Granted Crunch's computer hardware is a bit dated, however even with the graphic settings as low as they can go, framerates would range from over 100fps to under 10fps in very short order. He experienced lag during supposed decent framerate periods and astonishingly mission load cut scenes. WTF?! And everytime he adjusted the graphics settings (in a frustrating and almost futile attempt to get a decent, reliable framerate) the game has to replay the mission cut scene with no option to skip. It appears little effort was put into making a decent PC port or into quality control. Crunch experienced nothing but aggravation trying to play this game (one of the few games that consistent frustrated him to the point of wanting to put his fist through something).  Even IF the story was extremely compelling and well-crafted (and there are plot-holes almost from the very start), Crunch cannot recommend this game on the continuing (and likely never to be fixed) performance issues. Crunch gives it a 4.0/10 and that is being generous.  NB Because of such poor game performance and no resolution from the developer/publisher, Crunch will NOT be purchasing or playing CoD games anymore. So, he has uninstalled all his CoD. If Activision either resolves gameplay issues or drastically improves the quality of published games on day 1, Crunch might change his mind. MIGHT! He will also be cautious about buying games from the same companies."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"fREAKING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, IT WONT LOAD MY SPECS ARE ABOVE AVERAGE BEEN SCOURING THE FORUMS FOR FIXING AND THEY DONT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Black ops 2 is better then this.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst in the call of duty series! (it is just my opinion)
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Absolute overchurned garbage
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game itself is good, but the PC version is unoptimized as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I have a GTX 770 2GB and an AMD FX 6350 3.9GHz processor and this game lags like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. Get it on the Xbox and be a casual."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if i just would had a demo of this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to start with, so i didnt have to spend money on it. i am so disapionted in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ title.   Pros: good campain  cons:  multiplayer is so unbalanced and does not seem fair. singleplayer is also a big pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. and lets highlight the graphics..... they didnt even try to make it look good  i wish steam would let me get my money back from this crap, so i could go buy ANY other shooter! ....PLZ for the love of god DONT BUY THIS !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Recyled pish. Utter generic garbage spouted annually.  With the 'fish AI' and the 'dog' I figured 'Hey this one must be different!' But no it wasn't.  Sink 40 quid on they game. They want 40 more for the maps. Then they release dreadful 'voice packs' and hey THEY COST TOO!  Scripting and cheating have been rampant since release and the devs have done exactly NOTHING to address or remedy this.  0/10 avoid like the plague!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The call of duty saga is pretty big, and sometimes a fail is made, and call of duty ghosts is the biggest mistake in COD's history.  Bad story telling (In my opinion) Unstable Multiplayer hackers Etc. bunch of useless dlc's, even tho i my self play multiplayer, i often come aginst some hacking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, The only good gamemode n â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, is extinction, and even that is getting boring."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I once said this game is awesome... now I am wondering if I was drunk.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game - piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've played this game once, after having made â€‹â€‹the mistake of buying it... it took about 8h00 to finish it...  The single player is predictable , in fact this game has a ' to be continue ' , something that should NEVER be done, PLEASE STOP DOING CRAP!  I played the multiplayer... and believe me IT'S A CRAP because : 1 - Cheaters won. The cheating begun one month after released, IN ALL PLATFORMS! I saw cheaters on the PC, but there is cheaters on XBox and PS3; 2 - Lag... honestly , you didn't you learn nothing with MW2 and MW3 ? 3 - Same story in single player, totally nonsense and utopic, Mexicans in space? Do you have something agaist South America? 4 - A stupid system unlocks and attachments / perks increasingly ridiculous and overdated ; 5 - You must have a card that runs DX11 and graphics are exactly the same thing BO2. The sound system, I could tell where to put it...  In conclusion, this game is very bad. It has a stupid single player story... It proves that the director of 'traffic ' should be quietly in his corner. But worst then that, it proves that the player community is rotten childish and can ruin ALL multiplayer games .  IW thanks for taken private serves from all your games to please Xbox and PS3 and thank you for taking the kick and ban options."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After spending some hours (with some I mean quite a bunch), I've came up with this conclusion: - no love from Activision and it's clear from the very beginning - you cant choose a map nor a server: you will end up in the worst ping-wise and with your most hated map - perks... Yeah, let's give you the 'official Wall Hack' so you cant discern anymore who cheats from who does not - lag lag lag and then lag, but not the lag you suffer for your poor connection, but the HARDWARE LAG. This game is capable of knock down your hypersuperextra pc - have you ever tried to scope with the thermical feature of your beloved rifle? FORGET IT, it will freeze, making the shoot impossible /golfclap "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Play CS, it's better."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO not buy this SH8. it's not worth the money or the effort. lo player count on servers and campers in every corner.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is full of campers, noobtubers and other anoyinng stuff. The PC version is so bad. And in domination at least every 3 games someone gets a KEM from Care Package, WTF. I would recommend picking up another COD or play on console. Activision does nothing for the PC versions of COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,come on metascore... i think 68 is a bit high dont you.  its like sniper ghost warrior 2 with an even worse storyline. honestly id write a lengthy review but as always i put as much effort into my reviews as i feel the devs put into their games. i want my moneyback. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you infinity ward
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First of all, in order for campaign to be 'good', there's has to be 2 things: 1. Gameplay, 2. Storyline. What I want to say is that, this game has good graphics and gameplay wise; however, it's missing one thing. YES ITS STORYLINE SUCKS. LIKE HOLY DING DONG"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,No lets see here eh.... Texture quality in campaign: 0/10 cant see any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ see only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing matrix blue and white on the VERY FIRST MISSION Guns: 10/10 Beautiful see only in the first mission at space :v Should you buy it: -100/10 if they arent gonna fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing then so long COD :V I hope this help you guys a lot who is poor and save money to buy GOOD and PLAYABLE game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The story was great but, it was really laggy on multiplayer everytime i see a player,or every 2 sec i lag as hek"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst console port to pc...Graphical lag...freezes and many many issues..This game will make you so mad that will cause you an hurt attack...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"sorry but thats the worst cod ever, still like counter strike much more :)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't recoment this game cause it's one of the badest game in history and it need a beast pc to run at max settings.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,What is there to recommend???
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's just bad, it really is. If you are in for the Multiplayer and know what's coming, that's just fine. The Singleplayer Campaign is just garbage though. Absolutely no atmosphere, random generated story without any sense, the places where you go to are designed from 'Meh, well, that's ok' to 'Why? God, why?' It's not fun after all. I really regret buying this. The Singleplayer AND Multiplayer of Battlefield 4 are lightyears ahead of CoD: Ghosts, not to mention the graphics. This was the last Call of Duty I have ever bought. Such a shame when you think of the great first parts."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Violent video games don't make kids violent, bad video games with crappy anti-cheat software do.  Waiting a long time for enough people for a multiplayer game ... that's what you got to look forward to. Advertise free DLC with the purchase of the game and to people who walked away early might help but I have a feeling it is too late for this game. Currently sitting here waiting with 75 people for a game to come up on BRAND NEW DLC! 75 frickin' people, that is it.  I so want to like this game but ... Hackers and not enough people playing multiplayer. I see the same hackers week after week on the PC version and nothing gets done. Report but the reporting option is horrible.   At this point I have no idea how to fix the no one playing issue other than to limit the number of game options to force the few that are here to play into a larger pool. Sigh."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is not worth the money, campaign lasts 5-6 hours then you are stuck playing multiplayer. On normal multiplayer there are 1000 players split through playlists so u actually find (and start with all those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ intermissions) a game in 3 minutes. BTW you will get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off because of LAG, CAMPERS and some weird AIMBOTS that not only auto aim, they are killing you through many walls. anyway you forget it cuz it has 2 more multiplayer modes (yay). yeah, you wish. on squads there are barely 100 players and at least 20 game modes with 5 players on some and none on the rest. extinction is a nice game mode (has nothing to do with zombies) but they pulled off the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with the many game modes. if u anyway find game, some stupid noobs will come and ruin the game by doing the exact opposite of the chalenges. also i will have to say something more about the lag: it needs 0,5 MB (mega byte) or 4 Mbit (mega bit) connection; that's what requirements say. not true, you need 2 MB(mega byte) or 16 Mbit(mega bit) to play without lag. also, graphics are worse than 8 or 10 year old games and FPS drops a lot. EDIT: DLC is more overpriced than the game it self, not worth to buy game at all  my specs  windows 8.1 pro x64 14 gb RAM (8+4+1+1) 2x1TB HDDs 8X 3.06 GHz intel i7 proccessor AMD 5750HD graphics card LG FLATRON E2260 1920x1080 monitor 36 Mbit/s (4.5 MB/s) internet connection (cable/wired)  my rating 2/10 (10 beeing the perfect game like these good old DOS and even old Windows games 6-20 years ago)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,that was terrible...after all the sesquels and versions they still haven't fixed the dumbest and poorest designed aspects. DO NOT BUY. To the Developers...go the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ outside...morons.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is good. Nice SP and robust MP but feels like we got some performance problems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The latest iteration of Call of Duty does not make fundamental changes to its aging formula, nor its less and less impressive graphics, despite entering a new console generation. Activision beware: sans changes, even the CoD series is going to enter a downward slope soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I did not enjoy this game before I played Call of Duty Black opps 2 and I still do becouse there are a number of problems with Ghost mutiplayer.  1; The field of view is to small no pc version only 65 was 90 in BO2  2; Moving in the game is like walking in syrup  3: Grafics or not better but worse then in BO2  4: Sound is really bad comparte to BO2  5: Mouse setting are allmost impossible to get right  If I could I would ask my money back now I still play BO2 is still best COD game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Putting aside all of the glaringly obvious poor optimization (which I honestly cannot understand how the game managed to get out of development without these problems being noticed) the game is flat out terrible. The only thing I want to mention that is noteworthy is its new AI and squads modes which I think are nice additions to the game. But every other aspect of this game is horrid. Avoid this game at all costs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Personally, this game is a lot better on the next gen consoles and current. Apperently Infinity Ward can't optimize a game properly so you might have some performance problems here and there. I recommend waiting till this game is fully optimize and updated. Score rating 8.4 out 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Good:  - New Multiplayer Game Modes  - Large Multiplayer Maps  The Bad:  - Insanely Slow Load Times  - Dull and Bland Storyline  - Previeous-gen Graphics  Activision needs to look at what is current-gen before they start talking about next-gen.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like single player then Ghosts is a pretty good game, but if you're into multiplayer games then absolutely do not waste your money and time on this game. It is obvious this game was written for consoles and not PC and why it was even sold for PC's is beyond me. There is no dedicated servers which is why I spent the money (I really want my money back) on this game. There is constant crashing, no matter what the latest tip is on fixing the game, the forums are replete of problems and issues, and nothing has been done to any signficance for the usual cheating in the game. A patch has been put out for the game which resolved some of the problems but it is far from perfect. I for one will not be purchasing another game Activision or Infinity Ward pushes since they obviously are geared toward console gaming. To sum it up, no dedicated servers (this is absolutely the most important to me), very poor PC support, constant gaming issues, weak implementation of anti-cheat (like reporting does any good) and the best parts of the Ghosts preview videos do not exist in multiplayer. At the time of this writing I have 130 hours on the game, still hoping for resolutions, so it's not like I'm just hating, just wishing I had never spent $60 to preorder an overrated game. Just glad I didn't preorder the map pack this time around."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst game i ever played on steam, sorry, i would like to reformulate, this is the worst game.  They just do not care about PC gamers, so i would stop carrying about Activision too, at least about Infinity Ward. Also this is another milestone for me, I will stop preordering games because of this. Lesson learned!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"my specs are 2tb hd, quad core ic7, 16 gigs ram, 2 gig vid card 630 gt nvidia and i have to run this game on lowest settings and i still get fps drop to the point i get a still picture for like 2 secs and by time everything is ok again im dead. usualy happeneds when i zoom in with a scope or when im getting shot at. this is so rediculas its pethetic. i get better frams with battle field. seriously though, why all this grapgic lag. IW had plenty of time to fix this but not even so much as a release date to fix all this. 15% of the cod player use pc but if u think about it thats still alot of people. 15% is great enough of a percentage to keep up with some updates. step it up devs  edit*** surprise.. almost 4 months later (1/3 of a year) still no updates to fix this lag. wish refunding was available :("
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst port ever. I mean, RE4 (pre-HD) and Dark Souls are awful ports, but at least they are playable! At least, once I mod those games, they work nice. This port lags, freezes, and bugs out CONSTANTLY. I have to turn the graphics to Wii levels (not Wii U, the first Wii) to get it somwhat stable... I HAVE A GTX 660 AND AN 8-CORE PROCESSOR! This is beyond unnaceptable!  I can understand being lazy when it comes to PC ports. But there's a difference between making a lazy PC port, and making a port THAT DOESN'T WORK!!! Seriously, it is broken! Downright broken! The game is constantly freezing, CONSTANTLY! I've never seen anything like it. It's like I'm playing Crysis 2 full settings on a 8800gt... only worse.  Avoid at all cost, not just because it's bad, but because IT DOES NOT WORK!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The FPS drops and poor support/lack of dedicated servers make this purchase a waste of money. My system plays new games just fine but this game constantly lags and stutters in online play randomly. Not worth.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To many hacks and cheats in multi player Great in Single player and private sessions But theres just to many hacks and cheats in multi player and nothing being done about them
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Piece of CRAP!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I remeber bying the first CoD many moons ago and remembered it to be one of the greatest FPSs I have ever played. Hands down. The detail and love on every conceivable level that had been poured into the game from a relatively small, unknown studio was immense, all of it with the goal of making the MoH series look bad. It worked. Maybe a little too well.  From the original CoD to where we are now, the games have been gradually getting worse. There have been up points, WaW and MW2 had their moments, but aside from that it's been pretty crap. The CoD series has become a series of games to be aimed at people who don't play games. It is now a franchise for bros.  Too many ideas people saying 'lets do this!' 'what a good idea!' have killed CoD. Too much money has been poured into the franchise for CoD to be about being a decent game - nowadays you're just paying for the label - seriously - and Ghosts is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful.  -Graphics/lighting/models - Nothing special, in fact some times quite disappointing. Battefield 3 is prettier...and older, think about that.  -Gameplay - Nothing special. It's CoD, so pretty unimaginative. A couple of new features like controlling a dog. Huzzah...  -Sounds/Soundtrack/Voiceacting - Nothing special, save the voice acting. They managed to get genuine actors for a lot of the voices, including that awesome Colonel bloke from Avatar. Mint.  -Characters - Riley the Dog is by far the best. Everyone else is forgetable and terrible.  -Campaign/plot - It's like a bad Michael Bay movie. Sorry, I mean, it's like a Michael Bay movie. Lot's of explosions, people shouting 'OHMIGAWD!' 'RANGEEERS!' 'SHIIIIII-!' 'MARIIIINES!'. Plot wise, CoD was kind of losing the plot around MW2, going a little nuts with BO2, but in Ghosts they've gone completely off the reservation. It's laughably bad. All of it. And then you stop laughing. Because it's bad.  -Multiplayer - The new custom soldier features are quite cool and the money system is one I've always liked. Sadly, like all CoD games on PC the multiplayer is easily and frequently hacked by people who have just bought CoD to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ people off. The Infection mode? Nazi Zombies without the Nazis or zombies and so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ridiculous it's barely believable - then you remember that Ghosts was conceived by a four year old and all makes sense. Oh yeah, it's CoD, so every lobby will be filled with prepubescent tw@s.  All in all, Ghosts is decidedly average; nothing sepearting it from anything else except the CoD badge. Compare it to big name games that came out around the same time and it scores below average. Take that into consideration and then think about all the hype, all the promotions, all the money and all the people who worked on this game and their years of experience to give you the final product. Shameful.  Stood next to it's ancestors like CoD 1 and CoD 2, Ghosts is appalling - stood next to it's primary competitors like Battlefield (Both BF3 and BF4 with their fair share of problems), it is incomprehensibly bad for all the resources that it had while in development.   And then there was the initial 6GB RAM requirement for PC users...when the game uses 2GB at a push. Just bone idleness during the port process? Possible, or trying to mislead PC gamers into thinking that CoD Ghosts was pushing the envelope? Let's hope it's the former. But judging by the finished product I'm not sure the devs would be stupid enough to say that Ghosts pushes any envelopes. Not even a nudge - the envelopes remain stationary. Hah. Stationary.  And the to have the audacity - the bare faced cheekery to (still!) charge full price for this dry turd on a plate? Save your money. If you want to play a good CoD game, don't buy anything after the first Black Ops, they were really phoning it in by that time.  CoD is well past it's peak and needs a fall from grace. After that they might make a decent game again - like MoH managed to...until they messed it up again..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I keep getting this pop up - DirectX encountered an unrecoverable error. ' Check the readme for possible solution.'  I just installed Ghost, what did I do wrong ?!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Uninstalled this game as it failed to run. Tried to contact support via email, forum and phone to no avail. Support for this game is non-existant and the suggestion of it being otherwise is rubbish."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really did think that Infinity ward would do their homework and make a good new COD but as it seems it's anouther fail, the host system is trash, the spawn points, campers, map layout are still bad and if the maps are small, why can't I go in all the buildings and do more damage to them as in battlefield? the VAC system dosen't seem to work, in all the game could be good but I think it's far from it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty Ghosts (Modern Warfare 4) The main story's ok so far although I'm not that far through. The weapons are pretty similar to the ones in BO2 eccept with different names. There are new guns though. New classes of weapons. The multiplayer is great. It's as good as all the other COD multiplayers as they're all pretty similar. The maps are huge which is the best. The system of using clan points to get weapons etc. works pretty well. Extinction, which I was really looking forward to isn't very good. If MW3's survival and BO2's zombies had a baby this would be it. The game is 25gbs so it takes ages to download which sucks. Unless you have a good gaming computer then I wouldn't reccomend getting it as it runs badly. My gaming laptop has the minimum graphics card, 8gbs ram and i7 @ 1.73 GHZ, plays Bioshock Infinite and BO2 on the highest settings with no lag but still I have to put the settings on medium or low in Ghosts. I don't think that many laptops will play this well. I'm not so sure about desktops. If it was really powerful then it might be able to acctually play it on max settings. Anyway although it has bad pc support it is a fun game. And if you like the other CODs then you'll probably like this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Can I have my money back?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Although we may be the master race... buy it on a console. Not enough people play it and it runs like S@%T .
Call of Duty: Ghosts,pretty terrible. made me stop playing cod
Call of Duty: Ghosts,buy this game for your worst enemy
Call of Duty: Ghosts,don't waste your time and money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Stay away from this junk. It only has cool ads but in terms of REAL gameplay...it sucks. Plus this is by the fake second hand reject guys of the original Infinity ward...so boviously the game sucks and the engine is not even optimized. And yes the spec required for this game are fake...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Playing Call of Duty: Ghost gave me the impression that somewhere along it's development, IW lost sight of where to take the franchise next. Everything is forgettable with this iteration.  By now everybody who actually follows the franchise knows the single-player is just a couple of hours long (finished it over a weekend If I remember correctly and I am terribly slow with games) as the part and parcel is the multiplayer. While this isn't automatically bad as there are games that are short but great as the devs were good at trimming down the excess fat presenting a lean but satisfying experience (can't think of an FPS right now - Metro 2033 maybe? I remember it not being terribly long - but from other genres there is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons as an example). The single-player for Ghost unfortunately is forgettable. Neither the protagonists nor the main bad guy stood out and were all cardboard cutouts. I'm not hoping for a deep and insightful experience but nothing about the story remained after I finished it. To be fair, neither was Black Ops II remarkable however I enjoyed the multiple endings and how it did not handhold you on how to get the best one (there were some game-y type decisions but there were also subtle ones). There's also a bit of nonlinearity (very limited) which was a welcome change and could have been a good carryover to Ghost. Ghost could have furthered these ideas but sadly the devs did not stray from the well-worn path. And no Michael Rooker.  Performance-wise I experienced random slowness even when there's nothing really happening in SP. I tried reloading but the sluggishness appear to be really random for me. I cannot say if this was later fixed as I did not touch the single-player after I was done with it. For multiplayer, I haven't encountered any performance dips with multiplayer although I'm still experiencing a bug with the red dot sight looking like a broken glass from time to time. This unfortunately carries over to the succeeding matches and the only solution I found is to completely exit the game. I found the graphics to be ok - not terribly bad looking but it wasn't a mind-blowing, eyeball-melting, next gen experience. Nothing about it screams next gen to me. The art direction is nothing to right home about but to be fair so are the rest of the military shooters. How different would the art direction be? I don't think it has been a strong suit of the franchise anyway. Aside from a few of the multiplayer maps, what stand out to me in a not-so-good way is how brown it is. If I close my eyes right now and imagine the maps in my mind, it's all brown and several gradiations of it.   And then there's the multiplayer.  After playing a considerable amount of time with multiplayer (caveat: I exclusively played TDM so my MP experience is based solely on this game mode), this is the worse of the last 2 iterations (Black Ops II being the former). I cannot speak for the earlier ones as I came in very late to the party but with my very limited COD background, I enjoyed Black Ops II by far with it's smaller maps which makes for faster rounds and lesser camping. I lost count how many matches that ended unfinished with Stonehaven, Siege, and Whiteout due in no small part to both side camping their butts off.   During the latter months I have personally experienced hackers which I did not had the displeasure of encountering any with BLOPS II or were at least very discreet about it. Some are even repeat offenders despite reporting it several times (example:  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015390384).  Have IW/Activision gave up support once they knew they had a lemon on their hand and were contented to milking their fans with the DLCs?   For the guns, personally (and I could be wholly wrong), I did not feel that there were any that were OP but I do not really play competitively nor did I pour any amount of time researching the pros and cons of each one. I just picked what I liked (Honey Badger, Vector CRB, and the M27-IAR depending on the map) so I think I'm a poor judge of what changes or additions were good or bad compared to Black Ops II or the other CODs. Same with the skills and perks as I usually play a stealthy, run-and-gun type.  Overall my experience with Ghost soured me with COD considering I have only played this one and Black Ops II so I do not have the franchise fatigue that some players may have and I do not have the long history to make comparisons with the earlier iterations however if this is any indication of where the series is heading, Activision should lower their sales forecast and should seriously think of maybe temporarily retiring COD and retool it from the ground up as looking at some of the upcoming games, there are several that are multiplayer-centric that appear to be more than capable of taking COD's place over time. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has disappointed me greatly. It's graphics sucks, all you do is lag and then you lag some more. On multiplayer, the killstreaks are terrible. Squad points are stupid.  The only thing good about this game was the story of the campaign. Otherwise, it's worthless to me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do not play -10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible PC port, i can't believe Steam would let this immense pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that IW calls a game on here. Even the console version sucks but still not as bad as the PC version"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,BO2 better than this....so dissapointed that i bought this game...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Waste of money. Wish I could get a refund. Hackers galore. Very unoptimized.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fun to play but way too many game break issues. Campaign is ok but I did not enjoy it like the last games. Wait awhile for a sale or wait til the next game. This game is worth a skip until the issues are fixed. Update 2-15-2014  Game is still badly broken. They added FOV support finally but the game still run terrible no matter what you do. So many things are badly balanced, it's just not fun to play anymore. I still do not recommend this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS, I've been a fan of call of duty for years! This has been the worst call of duty ever! The PC platfrom for CoD ghosts is so bad, FPS drops, laggy servers, and a bad gun play, the mode extinction is why I wanted it, but no, it was so so bad too, 2/10 DO NOT BUY. :3"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is poorly optimised and does not run smooth even on the lowest setings avoid at all costs. it is not the money even if it goes on sale or if it is free. BIggest waste of time and money i have had the miss fortune to experience in all of my life!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game was not properly configurated for computers. Cutscenes lag constantly and the the sound cuts in and out, so I am unable to listen to the story. I am running the game on a MSI G Series GT60 2OC-022US laptop, which exceeds the minimal and recommend requirements by a lot. I run the video settings on the highest setting and it tends to lag frequently. I switch all the video settings to low and the gameplay runs smoothly with some lag from time to time, but the cutscenes still lag terribly and the sound cuts in and out! The gameplay itself has a lot of problems as well, during an extinction match I planted the drill on the designated area and it would not allow me to switch back to my gun no matter what I tried to do and it showed I was still holding the drill. It stayed like that until I died, which ends the game. When I started playing the multiplayer it had problems connecting to the servers and I was at my friend house using his comcast internet, it would take forever to connect to the server. I tested the connection speed and the upload and download was perfectly fine. Therefore, the game servers are the issue. Sometimes the connection would just drop when I'm trying to connect in the game. The story, I think is just terrible, my expectations were that it would be better than the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series, boy was I wrong, (SPOILER ALERT!), the story was about how the confederation takes over most of the world and hijacks a giant space cannon that could obliterate the earth, then the confederation reverse engineers many of their own and you go and stop them in space. (END OF SPOILER!) The story was too easy to guess and just to plain and simple. The Modern Warfare series had a complex story of betrayal, trust and distrust between the characters. I cannot describe how good the Modern Warfare series, but it is a hundred times better that this crap. The only new features is that they added a few more of gamemodes that are not that fantastic and they kept the classics. That's it no other features! Which is very disappointing and they took out zombies ;(   Overall, the game was poorly configured for computers, even for the best of the best computers (Ex. the cutscene's sound cuts in and out and lags, no matter at what video setting). The game is very glitchy, especially during extinction mode. The Call of Duty servers are very slow most of the time and can drop connections while trying to connect. Story is total crap compared to the Modern Warfare series, when a game is made it should be better that the last one. Practically no new features were added. It seems like they just copyed the old game and slapped in a few new features and changed the look and story. Very disappointing. Not worth $60.   The gameplay was good (the shooting and killing part, not the story), but that was it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on PC. Played every CoD since Modern Warfare, and this is by far the worst."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Terrible game engine, not optimized for pc. Don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"multiplayer mode always lag, returning to ops2"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I am not happy with the game as I am tired dealing with hackers and Steam doesn't seem to care. Try getting rid of a player called 'thaT g!rL' that has been reported a hundred times at least and they are still playing.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,mwf 2 ok but this omg
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Disappointing at best. Game (single player) is half what previous Call of Duty series contains. Graphics are not as good, Too much of automatic sequences built into game instead of actual game play. Looks like it was rushed in production to make money. This game deserves a free DLC for people who purchased it at $60.00"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is by far the worst port I have ever experienced attempting to play on the PC. The framerate is all over the place, the graphics are simply uprezed textures from the console version with nearly no support for things like DX11. The campaign is boring, predictable, and the only CoD single-player that was so uninteresting I didn't even finish it. The multiplayer from what I was able to play was the same old song and dance as usual. The problem is, I was having some fun with it until the game decided to constantly crash from an extremely obnoxious memory leak crashing issue. I have an fx 8350 and 2 gtx 770s in sli, and this game lags and crashes more than extremely demanding next gen titles like BF4, Crysis 3, and the Witcher 2. It is horribly optimized and won't even launch unless the person playing has at least 6gb of RAM, which means anyone with an older, midrange, or laptop PC won't even be able to play the game. And they have the gall to not only relase DLC but buy out Nvidia to sponsor this peice of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. As a CoD fan for many years I can tell you that your money will be much better spent of Black Ops II, which is a great port and has the best campaign the series has seen in years. It is a much better game and you can run it on anything. CoD: Ghosts is one of the worst FPS games I've played and as a PC port it is a disaster. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is awful beyond belief, a total downgrade and an insult to the shooting games market. The last good Call of Duty game was World at War. Save yourself the money and don't buy this. If you want a good shooting team based game that only gets better, play Team Fortress 2, its free aswell. Now let me tell you how i really feel...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Where to begin? This game is garbage, complete and utter garbege, and not just on PC, on PS3, Xbox 360, PS4,AND Xbox One. Thos may be one of, if not, the WORST Call of Duty games. Though I don't think it's AS bad as Modern Warfare 2.. Morale of the story, DON'T BUY IT!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The Extinction leaderboards are full of 'hackers' or fake accounts. It's not real, therefore it's a pointless feature. COD Does not seem to even want to rectify this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't Waste your money for this suck!! So many Hacker and It's didn't support Crossfire Lag and Slutering !!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Hackers are running rampant! Do somthing about it or I WILL NOT BUY another cod game! This is a good game but the hacker problem makes it very hard to recommend!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Other than the fact that i can;t play it due to all the crashes, it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst cod yet, but plays it anyway so i can say how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is...   1. Know cod is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  2. Buy it anyway  3. Hate on it  4. repeat the process"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is the worst PC port I have ever played it is completely garbage and unstable and crashes every 30 minutes of play time. I'm done with this terrible game and I wont recommend it to anyone!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Crap game too much lag in game play. Black Ops still a better game. Shame really instead of getting better it gets worse :(
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Most horrible CoD ever, runs awfull, no servers, LOCKED FOV, just a 100% console port, oh and dont forget that they still havent fixed the game, and we are a month after the release date.  Thanks for stealing my 60 â‚¬'s Infinity tard  Luckily they updated the game with brand spanking new 'Next Gen' fur for the dog, at least they know their priorities /sarcasm  tl;dr  Stay away as far as possible from this game, dont even get it if you can get it for free."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game was reallly good up until christmas when i noticed there are lots of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hackers now this is probably one of the worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing games in the history of call of duty feels like playing cod 5 i thought you would have had your act together you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tools why dont you take my money and shove it up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are you doing right now to stop this once again another â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in stupid cod game that isnt taken care of so thank you for making me waste my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money and my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time playing your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,load of crap !!!!1
Call of Duty: Ghosts,like call of duty II to many Hackers AND cheters sorry I was A big fan of call of duty not any more.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Game is only good if PC is boss
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"POORT COD GAME REALLY BAD ..   COD HAS GONE DOWN HILL , I HATED BO2 BUT JEEZE ITS BETTER THAN THIS CRAP......  BF4 AND CANT WAIT FOR TITAN FALL"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,at first the game was running great then came the lag then the crash and now ican play please patch all of this crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Single player game is broken. FPS dips even on the newest GTX cards. crap game is crap.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,black ops is better then this rubbish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Cod game! From now on i'll be really careful before buying a game made by Infinity Ward. Too bad I can't get a refund.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,To much hackers and unbalanced matchmaking
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fx6300 6core 2x8gb 1333 team elite ram msi gtx 760 2gb  lag above medium settings...............(bad optimized) even with graphics set to ultra. it looks very out dated.  no dedicated servers. so no vac bans for hackers.....  evey game has someone on god mode.  complete waste of money  infinity ward really have shown they only care about people with the new consoles.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Broken game and Hack fest. Devs abandoned the player base and DID NOT address main problems. Don't spend money on this, even if they offering 90% off."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,how is this a war game it seem to me that these maps are getting worse
Call of Duty: Ghosts,there is no servers!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I expected a lot but the game didnt satisfy me also the multiplayer maps were really awful, spawn kills and lags ... "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I bought the game to make this review   dvggfsxzhkfjksdnf  11/10 best review
Call of Duty: Ghosts,If I had the choice to give this game away or throw it in the trash. I would throw it in the trash where it belongs. I've owned this lame excuse for a game since it came out. Since this 'game' is optimized for consoles it runs like a person with poliomyelitis on my dual GPUs. I can thank this games developers for teaching me to NEVER pre-order any game ever again. Do not purchase this for PC. If you own a console that would be the only thing I would buy it for that is if you can withstand the gangs of 12 year old aficionados.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The single player experience is ok, but as we all know the point of a CoD game is the multiplayer, and the multiplayer in this game was completely unplayable. Don't waste you money on this and if you still have hope, wait for the Advanced Warfare with this advice: Don't ever Pre-Order it! You may regret really bad"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I regret paying for this game. First of all, it's a major dissapointment, like every other CODs, second, all the weak â™¥â™¥â™¥ DLC's are over priced and lastly, the game is so poorly optimised it should be criminal selling this game without saying anything bad about it.  Activision has a habit of not caring about pc users but they seem to be getting worse every year ( Selling black ops for 43$? wtf man ) They overcharge for everything, keep their prices so high up they could buy their own country! And the game is barely playable on an average PC ( I can run BF4 no problem with low-mid graphics and Advanced Warfare on Mid graphics ) But not Ghosts.  I love the idea of having customisation in a game, a lot. But 5$ for a skin? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you. People already pay 65$ for the game, almost 60$ for a couple of cheap and small maps...now we should pay a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton more for all those interesting customisation options? This is the reason Activision is dying. Fanboys are keeping them running, only that."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I bought the game.. Played it for a while and man this game suck a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... Ok.. If you are searching for a boring game with terrible graphics, that still somehow can't run at more than 27fps on my 1k â‚¬ computer.... This game is just awful.. 59â‚¬?! The real price for this is 5 bucks .. It's really sad.. lets see : + nothing mentionable.. - Awful graphics, bad gameplay, bad controls, terrible mp and sp.... So my rating is -2/10... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you and your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game infinity ward... i wan't my money back.. Waste of time and money... If someone wanted to buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i'm just gonna say: You're welcome for this review ..... [Btw if my english is bad i'm sorry im really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ... ]"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer is good. Extincation too. MP okay. Staff for this game need to listen to all of gamer. I wouldn't say 'not recommend' if they have listen to player. Cano need to be free, not paid. Activision already have a lot of money but never beat Battlefield 4 which I should have get BF4 instead of Ghost. 3/10  UPDATE 0059 2/28/2014 There is update that change of GUI. I like it but still they need to fix it. Server have lag problem in west USA. They should create more server in west and east of USA. IR Scope is little hard to see. Still not recommend it because I now give it 4.5/10.  UPDATE 2154 11/22/2014 The new COD AW just come that work well to some people which make me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off. They don't ever use their money to fix GHOSTS! I'm stick to Battlefield series for now. Thank you EA for make enjoyable game. Thank to Activision for cost me 100 dollar without ever fix with hacker issue. I won't buy any more COD unless they put a real admin and real server browser, which is what BF have it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OMG!!! This game is... a piece of crap. I would have a better time looking at cat porn than playing this. Sad to see how bad of a port this was and to see IW fall so hardly on their faces. 1/10 would not recommend.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is just the worst cod game to date .... this is just a game that sits in my game list unlikely to be ever reinstalled
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've been a COD fan for a while. I haven't seen the early CODs, that it seems a lot of people like, such as COD4 and MW2. But, I do have to agree with the negative reviewers. I don't think the game is 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' and 'the worst game ever.' But I do think it was badly ported, and seemed like IW was going through the motions. I've only ever played one IW game (MW3) but even this seemed like a copy and paste with a mere reskin. The long and short of it is, don't buy this. Save your money for AW (which is great) or COD 2015. And spend your money on a different game that is available during this sale.  TL;DR: Don't buy this. Buy AW if you want a COD, or another game if you want one during the sale."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the gameplay is alright but the graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but INFINITY WARD said the graphics were going to be great
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"horrible game, game was rushed and defenitly very bad quality, could I get a refund?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I originally bought this game to have as just another steam game in my library. I gave it a try, I wish I hadn't.  Playability = 2/10 mouse and keyboard works, cpu/gpu don't(!!!) Fun = 2/10 that Odin intro was funny Optimization 1/10 couldn't play it without stuttering etc.  Regret of purchase? YES"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is an honest review of Call of Duty: Ghosts   This game....... its not the worst game in the world, it's just not what I was expecting out of the Call of Duty franchise. For starters, this game is an absolutely TERRIBLE port to PC. You need practically a super-computer to run it and get good FPS. Another big part of why I don't recommend this game is that there are very few people playing it, and the few who do are usually master prestiege tryhards who will melt you with their seemingly magical headshot powers. Authough many people say that this game makes a new low in gaming, there are alot of things that this game actually did right.  PROS: -Many perks to choose from -Player customization -Good hit detection (even though you usually get melted by the time you ads) -Able to play as campaign characters from other Call of Duty Games -An astronaught suit  CONS: -The maps are bad -Hackers  -OP dogs -MTAR X -Very low player base -Hard to get into a game   Overall, I would not spend your hard earned money on this game. They just didn't care about the PC players this time around. I would spend my money on a game like Black Ops 2 or Advanced Warfare instead of this game. The final question is: Is it possible to have any fun at all playing this game? The answer is Yes, you can. The only challenge is getting into a game with reasonable ping and players that aren't level 80 master prestiegers who melt you on sight.  SCORE: 4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is a piece of crap. This sucky game ruined my beautiful PC. FPS drops, this game is literally a metaphorical 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you' from Inferior Ward. Doesn't even have an FOV slider. Treyarch on the other hand, I lerve you (As a PC CoD player). YOU HAVE AN FOV SLIIDER FOR GODS SAKE."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,IDK about this game. Not many people play this game so it's very hard to play online with other people and choosing game modes you like because mostly everyone plays TDM only and barely plays any other gamemode. I'm just not very happy that the game was kinda rushed also.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,crappiest campaign ive ever played and it is the shortest  pretty buggy and crappy. dont see how youll make another one like the other
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you have a console, dont buy this for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It would probally be as good if not better than MW3, if only I can resolve the DirectX error which prevents me from playing this exciting new game. I purchased 'Wolf Skin' in hope the download would fix my problem but, it did not. (DirectX encountered an unrecoverable error, check the readme for possible solutions') There are no possible solutions nor do DirectX downloads make any differance. I love the whole Modern Warefare concept but it's looking like 3 is as far as I can go. Such a shame and a waste of money. Mike."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Who releases a multiplayer game without anticheat? Who? If I had known this I would never have spent my money. I have a lot of hours played, thinking VAC or PB would come along with dedicated servers like they promised. No Dice. I'll play squads with friends for the upcoming dlc I already blew money on, But I think this is my last COD TITLE.  Like the rest say, don't buy it. You'll be sorry, and especially if you been around shooters for a while. Battlefield 4 blows this game away and I am no fan of EA but this time they did it right. Buy that instead.  To make myself clear, COD Ghosts is infested with cheats and hackers, and they make it available to everyone. Yes infested, and there is nothing to fight against it. A joke to say the very least."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty weak actually. I bought it played for a bit and just couldnt get over the screen jumping around, maps for COD are STILL TOO SMALL. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on the PC VERSION  HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS.....it gets old quick.  No dedicated servers, so hackers can ruin games (happens alot)' They do nothing to ban the hackers or UPDATE THE GAME!!  BATTLEFIELD 4 is 100 times better than this and has its own issues..... BUT COD GHOST IS GARBAGE! WOULD LOVE A REFUND FOR THIS GARBAGE!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Could of been a great game, instead it is a hackerfest. Almost as if they are trying to intentionally kill the PC gamer market. If they implement a anti-cheat system. I will change my mind, but I see no support or even acknowledgement of a problem with cheaters. My computer is more than enough to handle this game. Don't waste your money on this or the DLC's. I feel sorry for first time COD buyers, if this is their first and only exposure to the series.  Corsair 800d case Asus ROG Board i7 @ 4.5ghz AMD 6990 Graphics Corsair H100 CPU cooler 16 gig DDR3 2x160G Vortex3 SSD "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"As of right now, ghosts if terrible for pc. THere is no support for banning hackers, and at any given time there are only around 4k people playing multiplayer. There can be 500 people in a playlist and matchmaking will tell you that it still cant find a game. Very broken right now"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is garbage im mad that i wasted the money on this game black ops 2 is a much better gAME do yourself a favor and play somthimg else. the graphics arent clean the game play on mp is choppy horrid and not to mention no more than 5000 people on line can take forever to start a game of multiplayer. by the way i have a bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ gaming rig 6 core processor 3.8 ghz 16 g of ram with a geforce gtx 770 graphics card play bf4 a much better game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The biggest load of CoD i've ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst game,so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that it makes fun to play woth and against friends."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought this mainly for Multiplayer after all the hype. My most regretful purchase. Sigh...... I think the devs have abandoned optimising it for PC too...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Totaly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I ever saw!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you cant play multi player it says not responding give me my money back!!!!!!!!!!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I actually feel bad for people who even downloaded the free weekend
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Edit: I'm editing my review just to say this.  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT ACTIVISION TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE GAMING QUALITY SOMEDAY.  I got this as a gift from all the hype, and was thoroughly disappointed. I tried to look at the bright sides but simply couldn't.   I really wish COD series will come up to the masterpiece that was made back in 2007 as COD4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Had to get a reminder on why i returned this absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ excuse of a game when it first came out so i played it during the free weekend. The criminals that designed and sold this game with all the lies they told should be tried and punished. I will never give Infinity Ward another penny ever again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,if you dont have the right video driver you will not be able to play it so stupid WORST WAIST OF 60$ EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Constantly screen freezing and crashing. Way too long in the menu system beteen matches for multiplayer. Disappointed.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game has guns in it, and you shoot people with them real good... I love this game cause I buy the new one every 8 months... pee pee comes out when I hear there is new game like this one... cause I like boys!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bought this game paid way too much for a game that crashes every time I play it , waste of money ."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible Coding for such a long time running game infinty ward has gone down hill since their last team who is the best at nodern day combat games has left do not buy this game for 60 dollars only worth 10 dollars max on pc can not wait for treyarc next cod cause it going to bhe good and done to the expectations of video game design and playability
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The singleplayer was allright but was only about 4-5 hours for me.  Now the main thing I wanted to write is about the Multiplayer. For me the Multiplayer was that good and was the thing I was most looking forward too. What let it down is mostly the port. For example while playing the game I do experience some lag (But playable) but the more bigger issuse is the snipers. I like using snipers but in this when you scope in its halfs your fps. (Same as some normal scopes) One minor issuse is the game locks at 90-91 Fps. My setting are on mid-low.  Basic Specs: (If you want to know. I reakon have something better or about the same as mine for a better experience.) GPU: GTX 660 2 GB VRAM CPU: AMD FX 8320 at 3.50Ghz RAM: 8 GBs OS: Windows 7 64bit
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm sure on any other system this game is decent. I greatly enjoyed its predecessors, and am a huge fan of the feel of these games, USUALLY. That being said, this game is almost unplayable for PC. I have a computer that far exceeds the minimum requirements for this game (Radeon 7990, FX-8350, 8GB Ram) and it is so choppy at any decent graphic settings that it is unbearable. I could barely let it slide in campaign mode, but in multiplayer it is a disaster. I was perplexed at first as to how the game could perform so poorly on my rig, but after reading other reviews and forums, I see that many people had the same issue. I do not recommend this game unless you are okay with playing it on settings so low that it could be confused with Wolfenstein 3D."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. On the one hand you have a multiplayer experience that's extremely addictive and time consuming, but on the other hand you have poor optimization, an average campaign and an overall 'dumbed down' experience when compared to the recent Black Ops II.  I don't know if the addictiveness of the multiplayer alone can warrant a purchase, especially at such a steep price tag...but when you consider how horrible it runs, even on high-end gaming desktops...well, you get the idea.  I'm not gonna recommend it, but I'm not saying it's a bad game. If it ever comes down in price or somebody buys it for you as a present, by all means, play the ever-living crap out of it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is broken and has many issues. It is unoptimized. Yes your PC is powerful enough to play this game, you don't need better hardware. You need better developers making games that you buy. This game is a joke. It really is. It is unplayable to certain extents. Often times I find guns and viewmodels glitching out, causing textures to stretch all over accross my screen making it impossible to see. This game has framerate locks that cannot be changed, and uses a massive amount of video RAM for who knows what reason. On top of all these problems, the devs are not fixing anything, and instead pushing a load of DLC into our faces, asking for more money. Please, do not buy this game. Do not support this kind of behaviour. InfinityWard needs to realize they cannot abuse their customers like this, and that if they are going to charge a whole $60 for a game, it needs to work, and be updated and fixed if it has issues. Look up internet reviews and video reviews of this game for PC. They all say the same as me. This game is not worth anyone's time. The multiplayer has maybe 2,000 people on at max. And half of them are in Team Deathmatch. You can't even try out the new gamemodes because nobody is playing them. You literally cannot find a match, because none exist for that gamemode.The campaign is short and boring, and doesnt make sense. It has bad voice acting, and terrible cheesy moments. All the characters in the game feel insignifigant and you don't even care about them. Everything about this game sucks. The devs suck, the gameplay sucks, the community sucks, the support sucks... it. Is. Terrible. Do not buy this game. DON'T BUY IT. An absolute waste of time and money. Even on console this game has serious issues. It just wasn't built well. You're better off sticking with Black Ops II."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,one of the worst game i ever played in my Life. this game is so crap that i do ask you not to waste ur money as i did. whats the bad thing about it 1- Gameplay 2- graphic 3- sound ... basically everything is FAKIN CRAP.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not an absolutely 0/10 terrible game, but the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hosting and literally no people playing it at any given time is a big, big downfall...  Wouldn't buy this if I were you."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,And I thought Modern Warfare 3 was the worst.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Finally, a game with working Fish A.I. Seriously, don't buy this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you consider buying this game, DONT!!!! the mp sucks, this cod is heaven for campers, already a lott of cheaters, it takes ages to rank up, if you have not played this game and if you think you know the defenition of backrapen you dont the maps suck and dont make sense especcialy the spawn points, you basicly spawn right next to an enemy. if you played bo2 and you really liked that, dont buy this game. it is truly a kick in the balls for cod players, like myself. and i havent even talked about the extinction game mode, and i wont talk about it because then i would cry blood out of my focking eyesockets. this game is fun the first hour because youre then like ''omg new cod, bo2 was awesome so this must be better'', but after an hour youre like ''i would rather play just dance for 24 hours then 1 single match of this crap''. IW could have made something really awesome that we would forgive them for the big pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mw3 was, but they decided to not do that, and for that im never gonna buy an iw cod ever again"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO NOT BUY! The worst piece of crap I have ever bought.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Complete wank. Buy black ops 2
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can't believe I forgot to review this. Poor, just poor. Maps are too big for the numbers, maps have no traffic flow, scorestreaks as well as the meaningless content is underwhelming in comparison to Black Ops 2 (my first and favoured of COD games) and overall the game just doesn't evoke the same emotion or mix of anger and exhilaration as it's predecessor did.  That plus the fact they lied about it needing 6Gb ram and the dynamic environment nonsense too."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game su**s !!!! It is the worst CoD I ever played !!!   Badly transported from consoles to pc, graphic is bad, random lags on High End Gaming Pc !!!!, easy spawnrape and spawn camping,   You can not even play all weapons and gadgets in a custom game with bots, 'cause u need to unlock everything ingame !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Huge waste of money... im going to go repeatedly stab myself while running around naked through town as a punishment... -10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible game not worth the money.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is so behind the Modern Warfare 3 and even 2. Dont like it a bit, like I throwed money away. Dont buy it and save youself some serious money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful!! Tried to get into so many times but couldnt even play the singleplayer, its that bad! Would love to get my money back and buy a better game!  Want a good cod play all the previous titles even black ops 2 out shines this junk!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Takes to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing long to download. Plus if you delete the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game and re-download it then it becomes glitched so you have to keep clicking the fire button over and over for a fully auto and plus you walk a single centimeter every time you press W which you have to keep doing to just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing move. My opinion: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU TREYARCH AND ACTIVISON
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I expected better of Infinity Ward....this game is laggy, buggy, and hard to runn even on a computer with decent enough specs. Ive had to look up videos to fix some of the lag/glitching in this gamel, but all of it isnt even dealt with. The PS3 &amp; XBOX-360 versions are so much better i advice everyone who has a console to get it on a game system.    NOT PC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the absolute worst freaking thing I've seen, almost to the level of Homefront-bad. This game, if you can even manage to jump through the hoops to get it to properly /launch/ on your system, runs like a load of smeared â™¥â™¥â™¥ regardless of the settings, or the power of your rig. You will get constant in-game chugginess and frame freezes for 1-10 seconds at a time, even with pretty unnoticable improvements in graphics from earlier Call of Duty games.   Please, don't make the mistake I did and actually buy this. Or any Call of Duty beyond World at War, for that matter."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be either a bunch of hackers or some people who troll the community with millisecond accuracy. I give up. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the franchise. Had enough. No more call of duty purchases for me. What a waste of time.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I enjoyed CoD up to this point in its development. It is not that Ghosts is a bad game, however Infinity Ward does not actively admin their game. By this I mean that the majority of the players you will meet in multiplayer have aim bots or wall hacks, if not both. I am not saying this as a 'noob who gets owned' I am saying this as an extremely good, well rounded CoD player. Look on youtube if you do not believe me. The campagne mode is extremely easy and very short. Squad mode is cool but once again you will run into people who aim bot and wall hack. So whereas you might be able to kill the AI, when you run into the player themselves you will get shot in the face instantly. On top of that, people with these bots can find you on steam and 'challenge' you while you are offline 1000000x in a row and aim bot you to death and put your W/L ratio to 100/99999999 and there goes your entire record and all your hard work.   As of now I will not reccommend this game to anybody, however what I will say is if they actively admin their game and start ridding the game of the overwhelming amount of cheaters, I would start playing again and would change my review."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,NO THE CONECTIVITY IS RUBBISH
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Highly shi**y. Even the menu laggs, immagine actually playing it.  Trash. Rather burn your money than buying such a crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game doesn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ start up but because of some kind of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t it just crashes  and do the makers do  no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  keep your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,woz great untill update now un playable. steam sort it out
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm glad I only paid half for this game.... Otherwise I'd be throwing a brick through my window!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would have had more fun throwing 60 $1 bills out of the window while driving on the freeway. Just leave this place and never come back. I know that is says that I have 0 hours, but I have about 6 in multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,All my games run fine in 1080 but whenever i play this on any settings it crashes with a disc read error.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game play is good, but the uggly is that since the last patch the matchmaking seems to be very bugged. When it almost has a full lobby it will scatter everyone out and start the search from scratch again. Then when it eventually starts a game it crashes most of the time.  Also, in the past this game's series has been overrun by cheaters, also sucking the fun out of the game.   Will definitely not be buying the next games by these guys."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Storyline seemed really cool. The whole thing ended up being a ton of cutscenes though. It seemed to basically just be a series of shooting, then a long cutscene. Lots of pointless clicking to get your character to do random things that could have just been an action. On top of that, when you're running a crossfire rig, even an older one (which mine isn't) you expect things to be butter. This game was probably coded by a potato that only did C# development for the xbone in its spare time. Very laggy even after optimizing with settings shared by others."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Okay here are Five reasons why you shouldn't buy Ghosts for PC: 1: Activision/IW has put little to no effort into this PC 'Port' it is a game built for console. I would say buy console version if you really want this game.  2: The community is the SAME! anyone who came to the PC version for a better/friendlier community (Admittedly me), DO NOT BUY THIS! It's the SAME As console. Typical CoD community. Need I say more?  3: Performance. This game has terrible performance issues, I use my Alienware 14! It runs most games on High/Ultra I have to run this on Low/Med settings just to get a playable framerate.  4: Acessability/Offline. If you have a Laptop and travel to places without internet or a pretty slow/dodgey internet connection. Expect Campagin ONLY. Console? Sure have the Bots whenever you like. PC? NO!! MUST HAVE NET TO PLAY ANYTHING BUT STORY!!! That's FINAL! and it doesn't look like it will get fixed ANY TIME SOON (INFINITY WARD!)  And Lastly 5: Player Count. Max I have seen at one time is about 2000 players. This on top of NO LOBBY SELECTION! Means that I constantly get dropped into American, UK, Anywhere that isn't AUS. Meaning I get a really bad connection all the time.  Sorry Infinity Ward, Most of these things could be fixed, but aren't so I'm going to have to give a NO GO for this one! ~Zearos"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campaign is alright but multiplayer is broken. The lag/cheating is out of hand and it's hard to even find players to play with.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I've liked every COD game until this one. This is just plain and bad. It's plain bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I have an ear infection.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in match making ever... yeha stick a level 1 with a bunch of high levels.  GENIOUS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IN MOVE/..... no wonder the franchice is falling apart
Call of Duty: Ghosts,JUST REALISED THIS GAME FREAKING SUCKS ITS AN ABANATION TO THE SERIRES!!  I dont play many bad games and this is the worst game i have ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,bought it on a lark f&amp;^% this game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You get killed in -999999999 shots, people play for 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 hours, Your fire rate is like my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on a bad day. You do about -19999 damage with the AK47 but when the other team with 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 thousand hours uses it it does over 9000 damage per -12 hits."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gr8 b8 m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8. I r8 this b8 an 8/8."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazingly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  I thought it was impossible to release a game worse than no game at all.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,didnt expect this game to be so laggy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good game in my opinion, only problem is that the game is absolutely empty. The most players i have seen on is 1.3k, but majority of these players are on TDM which gets boring after a while. Bad to see that the community for this game has died."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,By far the most disappointing entry into the CoD franchise for me so far...but some say that's because I haven't tried MW3 yet. Textures need fixing from the get-go...it looks old and amateurish by current standards. The game feels clunky and lacks flow. CoD reached its peak at MW and this edition is just another tired entry on the downhill slope that CoD has become.  The single-player campaign is just a re-hash of missions from CoD 4 MW amd others.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Disappointed. I use keyboard/mouse, about half way into the game the movement keys began to pause movement. Saw in discussions the going from fullscreen to windowed(borderless) was the fix. Tried that and it seemed to work. The next day i played a bit and the problem returned. Not as bad as fullscreen but enough to get you killed in game. Next were some graphics glitches when using scopes. Half the scope view was 'smeared' with graphics, could only see half the xhair. COD used to be a great game and pretty well done. Now that they've doubled the cost of the game, the quality has been halved. Disappointing should be in the game description."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"OMFG!!! What that is From all COD franchaise that one is most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game realese ever.Constant mouse lag,screen tearing,flickering. they said patch will fix all isuue but its not.In fact this kind of game never should be realese to public.this is very poor beta version not working at all even on very strong PC and best gpu card.I want REFUND this game as im sick of try to make this game work with no results at all. I think this joke with that COD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAMES MUST END ASAP IN MEDIA&lt;NEWS AND TV TO SPOT PEOPLE WHAT THEY DO&gt;.IM finish with that |CO|D games dont want waste my time for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like this.DONT BUY COD GHOST GAME EVER AS ITS PACKED WITH HUGE NUMBER OF ISSUES BASICLY VERY EARLY BETA VERSION&gt;CLAIM MASSIVE REFUND MAYBE THEY START RESPECT PEOPLE WHICH IN FACT PAY FOR THAT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME&gt;THX"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign +Intel actually does something again other than just counting towards achievements +No infinitely respawning enemies +The Moonraker and Thunderball levels are pretty cool +/-Fairly nice setpieces, most of which are ruined by this terrible gray coloring. Honestly, half the levels in this game hit Gears of War 1 levels of gray. -Really easy, even on veteran -Cliffhanger ending implies Ghosts 2 -No 'choose your own adventure' aspect like Black Ops 2 -No loadout customization like Black Ops 2 -No challenges like Black Ops 2 -Characters are almost jokingly bland (yes, even the dog) -Worst voice acting in CoD and that's saying a LOT (  http://youtu.be/eT5JBeUg6ag?t=9m25s  )  Multiplayer +Cosmetic customization +Squads mode +They went and removed that godawful rotating challenge system +The ability to essentially switch which level of prestige you're playing on is neat -Extinction is not as good as Zombies. Aliens should be a lot more fun to fight than zombies, but somehow, they aren't. -The removal of Spec Ops isn't very good -None of the fairly nice setpieces mentioned earlier make a good transition (for example, the Vegas level in the campaign was one of the neatest while the Vegas map in multiplayer is one of the worst) -Octane and Chasm are some of CoD's worst maps -A lot more 'whoever shoots first wins' than other CoD titles  It's certainly a CoD game. It's a step down from Treyarch's titles in a lot of ways (particularly on the single player side) but a step up from Modern Warfare 3 (with the exception of Spec Ops)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game was hacked like crazy from day one....I played 28 hours.   I am one of many that have been banned from the activision account without reason and without explanation. Customer Service is also brutal!  Called, they gave me a case # to log in and comment or review my case #. I went in and could comment on my case, but it was already marked 'RESOLVED' - When I phone in and try to enter the case # to speak to a Customer Service Rep, the Case # is now invalid, due to being resolved.  Way to go, Activision! Last COD game I will buy and last Activision Title I will ever play."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't buy this game EVER
Call of Duty: Ghosts,online sucks. cant find a game and when u do everyone has more crap than you they can even see through hills. sucks just sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst supported game of all time. dont even think of getting help for this game when they randomly change something.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Huge waste of money... im going to go repeatedly stab myself while running around naked through town as a punishment... -10/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dont buy this game. I't legit just sucks. It sucks so much that I got a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ from it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is very similar to other COD games, but it is very buggy, to the point that I clearly feel ripped off paying for a game that is half baked, at best. It crashed my computer several times, had a horrible graphic glitch that made the game almost unplayable, and loading times were veeerrrryyyy loooonng - even installed on an SSD. I spent hours looking for a solution to the graphic issues only to find a lot of people in the same situation - no support from Activision or the developer. Definitely NOT recommended - DO NOT BUY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great game i love it but for some reason when im in the game , as soon as i click on Online service then it keeps saying ' connecting to online services ' and failed so i need to know why , all services are online . Need help to play again ?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good idea, not good execution eg 1) not optimised for pc graphics wise (ie RAM debacle), 2) no ping measure/graph. If it ran ok (even on beast machine with beast net) it would have been pretty good. But as is, I dont play it much (although i tried). Also hilarious how much extra content they are trying to sell to 'da kids' eg new guns, camos, ski masks etc ie useless bs....65/100 as per common rating is about right. MW3 and BO2 still the recent best for COD, with MW3 being more for the purist... fast, clean, hi res, smooth, fairly balanced, all round hella good fun. Do i recommend? well 'kinda', but can easily skip it, no probs (such a shame as the maps are pretty good). Perks system is over complicated. Ah well, it was worth a try, just didnt work out ;*( (lets not even start on the rampant hackers from day 1, omfg, cant they detect/prevent that yet?) Too much to be disappointed with overall. Lucky MW3 still has a strong player base, and for good reason."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is poo
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nope graphics, nope maps, nope sound!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"if you like poorly optimized games, or if u like awkwardly bad gameplay, and you just LOVE hackerz.  THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!.......but not for me  60$ down the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i've seen ports of timesplitters run better than this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Totaly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I ever saw!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you cant play multi player it says not responding give me my money back!!!!!!!!!!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I actually feel bad for people who even downloaded the free weekend
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I got the game a year ago and never played it, just instaled it, got banned for hacking and I have never payed it before. 10/10 Steam I want my money back!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I wouldn't play this game if Activision gave ME $60.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,10/10 Knife swings from 10m away that swipe at nothing but air kills.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS REALLY BAD the worsh game ever dont get this
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Buy the game for Xbox, doesn't work well on PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game made me live in Somalia
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's bad. Really bad. The worst CoD so far, taking MW3's place. You die too fast, the guns are all the same, the game is lagging immensly even with my More than okay Rig (i5-3570, GTX770), the maps are bad, the perks aswell as killstreaks aren't satisfying... everything is wrong about this game.  Do yourself a favor and buy Black Ops 2 instead. costs less and so far the best CoD ever created."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I do not recommend this game. It has the same fast and responsive FPS action that Call of Duty is known for but lacks the uniqueness the series held. The gameplay becomes repetitive and boring. I could not even complete the Single player game because of this. Multiplayer maps are attrociously designed with plently of exploitable locations that allow campers to set up and farm score streaks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm a fan of the Call of Duty series and I do not recommend it, if you want this game just buy the Playstation/Xbox version. Reasons for not buying it: - Terrible performance on pc  - Few people playing/ its hard to find matches - you'll find a cheater in 75% of the matches you'll play.  Trust me, I won't buy a COD game anymore (for pc, obviously)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've played call of duty since mw2 and this is the first game that I actually couldn't stand. You can say all you want about previous call of duty's, but they had some good moments and all around they we're actually solid games. This one was awful though. The multiplayer almost seems designed to make you bad. Maps are open and unstructered so you're constantly being flanked and shot in the back with no room to prepare or plan for it, and even the simplest of begginers can pick up the game and do about average. If you're thinking about getting a call of duty game, get anything but this. CoD4 has a really great multiplayer and a large fanbase still."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"singleplayer is a mess and to me multiplayer looked, sounded and felt like mw3. I won't be buying the next cod game until its discounted hard"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible for PC, go buy Shadow Warrior."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The reason i stop to play Call of duty
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not a game that I would recommend...  Bad graphics, tons of lags and impossible gameplay  Not recommending to buy the game..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful.Black ops 2 was great this game is awful, have to earn squad points for everything, the dogs are like homing missles. Terrible,"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same old multiplayer which i've come to enjoy but the singleplayer was very disappointing, which I suppose is to be expected with the franchise."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"First, it's more of the same and it's broken at pc - did not optimized - worse gameplay compare to its predecessors - lame graphic with high system requirements. Overall, it's not worth for full $60 dollars with such lame game with just a few decent addition."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Spectacle Creep. Spectacle Creep. Spectacle Creep.         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Spectacle Creep - When Sequels Try Too Hard - Extra Credits&nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts is yet again another Call of Duty game which I have been anticipating over the year of its release and when it has finaly been released, i have been dissapointed since then. Why? you may ask. These would be the reasons.  - The gameplay is very crooked/blocky and doesnt feel as smooth or flowy as it should be compared to the previous games in this sequal - The great fps lags I receive from this game has made it almost unplayable at times even after I have lowered the graphics settings and im pretty sure its not my computer's problems as I barely get many fps problems with every other games. - The atmosphere of the game just makes the game feel like its half done or just a random CoD game Infinity ward has created to fill in their Queue for the year's CoD. The game just doesnt feel like it has been worked upon as Infinity ward has said so, maybe due to bad capital allocation during it's production. - The single player is decent however it doesnt feel very indepth compared to its ancestors e.g. The Black Ops series  The game does look pretty good in terms of the game's visuals and how everything looks as well as the ability to interact with the map in multiplayer (which should have been included ages ago). To conclude, i would recommend other CoD games.  Ps. my hours are messed up dont look at it ;p"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,well this year infinityward messed it up. call of duty ghost is ok but its not good and it has the worst prestige the worst story ever!!!!! when I played the story it wasen't talking about ghost it was talking about some random family become ghost. but i play the game just to finish the prestige's but know i hop that on the next call of duty would be better. I would give it an  6/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The singleplayer was a big let down. sadly the multiplayer isn't as fun as blackops II. Something seriously went wrong with this game. And that's on top of performance issues. 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst PC port of all time
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I just bought the game 2 days ago and this thing is failing to launch.. PLEASE HELP!!!

Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible, just horrible. So much lag on pc, even the best computers get lag.      SHAMEFUL DISPLAY"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I'm sorry but this game kind of sucks. Doesn't feel right. I feel disconnected from the player. I gave it a try.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sadly the game still has cheaters, performance problems and a really low player base. Its still a reasonable good game if you can get past all those problems."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just avoid Activision and Infinity Ward.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I've always loved call of duty --- but they NEED to make this game more PC-friendly. Even the most powerful gaming rigs have issues -- it was poorly ported to PC, mainly made for consoles -- this is clear"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Have tried to make this game run smooth and do everything I know of but still can't get nice performance. This game has worst performance problems than Cryostasis. Read the reviews, from everyone else, it is not an exaggeration, this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor optimized."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Obviously breath taking visual quality, incredible and stunning story telling from the best crew. Deep emotional connection with the characters including Riley the K-9 dog. Equally captivating storyline as the Call of Duty Black Ops franchise was. Great work. However one really annoying issue that seems to be a major bug or systematic error in the game, is the sniper rifle scope FPS drop. When I look (aim) with the sniper rifle scope at any given circumstance the FPS (and therefore my ability to accurately aim) goes from my solid 60FPS down by avg. 15-20 to somewhere around 45 FPS. The stutter that this causes, especially compared to when I do not look down on the scope, makes it impossible to perform well as a sharpshooter. My squad and I lost multiple battle rounds in multiplayer because I was unable to support them as a sniper. Any updates or bug fix that will help this very troubling issue? It is obviously not my computer hardware (as you will see my specs at the end of this note), I also saw other users complaining about it. Please save the game for poor PC owners and do not do the same mistake as Ubisoft or other companies are doing by abandoning the PC game market with badly optimized PC versions. Appreciate if anyone from Infinity Ward reads this.   My rig: intel i7 4770 proc with liquid cooling dual GTX 780 in SLI 16 GB RAM Win 7  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"My overall feeling about this game isn't great at all! I would say it's actually pretty bad - atleast when it is compared to the other call of duty games.   Only things I find positive about this game is map design and levels. The creator has really put a lot of effort into the map design. The maps are larger and more open than previous games, however, cause of the slow phased movement, it'll take forever to get across from one side of the map to the other. Clan wars was a good introduction to the game. It was fun and also diffrent to what we've seen before. Exctinction mode was also fun, but nobody seemed to manage to play it. Also, the introduction of guard dogs or whatever they're called seems like a good idea for a new and exciting killstreak, I actually liked it very well.    The thing I'm most disappointed about is the combat and movement system. Movement system has made the game too slow phased and boring. The weapons are lacking differences, cause they all feel like the same to me. Why does the game lack the options of for instance fov change? I had to download a separate mod to change the fov to 90 to make the game playable. Most people playing video games at pc would have as many graphical options as possible, that's one of the reasons for why we play on PC instead of playstation or xbox."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad game in it for your money. Obviously... No interest in PC Gamers.. You will be paying for all extra mini addons... Community is small and every DLC pack is played from a different menu. Basically that will mean with every DLC u get u will also find less people to play with. Its bad .... Really !!  Lots more to write here in negative way but just read the other posts for further explanation. The Soul is gone from the series and it was bound to happen after milking the franchise to come to this game eventually.. Put new people who are passionate about a game behind the wheels and give the guys doing this and falling for the money trap some time off !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a waste of money. doesnt even load. requirements my â™¥â™¥â™¥ i just build a 1500 euro pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to many hackers and steam dont give a @#$# 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,fix the game for PC players!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why dont you do anything about the cheating that has spred like a virus in Gost??? People that like tha game and dont cheat gets sick of it! Nope this game suck and if i could i would get my money back cause Infinity, you dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst game ever. I got VAC banned for cheating when I wasnt cheating -.-. This is the 4th time I got banned for nothing and then having steam staff tell me to make a new steam account and pay for the game again. LOL that wont happen.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dis â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Needs A Good â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Another great job by infinite Ward! Gift this to someone you hate. Unplayble, low fps even with a good computer. I want refund this game Valve plz..........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Too slow, dont spend time with this"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game itself is fine, could be better optimized though. Liked SP a lot. The story itself is good. But its full of bugs indicating this was a rushed release and even a year later the bugs are no way near fixed. MP is a different story. MP itself (content and maps and weapons balance ect.) is fine. But the lack of IW relasing patches to atleast temporarely stop cheaters, totaly detroys and ruins the game, you can't play 2 or 3 games without comming across atleast 2 wallhackers and 1 guy running with wallhacks and aimbot as well.  For now, I would totaly tell you to play some other game. If IW remains at this level of stupidity as it did/does for this release, then this would be my last IW game ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game play is fun, however i have never had more technical problems with a game. I have an Exceptional computer and it does me no good in the wake of this games many issues."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If your a hacker buy this game it's fun, if your not (like myself) don't."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cant play campaign without it crashing, some serious issues regarding some loadscreens"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pre-purchased with the hype, played the single player only. The story was a bit bland and short (left me wanting more) but the loading times and constant stuttering during load scenes also had me bothered. The gameplay itself felt very linear and killing stuff felt more like a hit and miss than get in some proper shots to kill. I've still got the multiplayer aspect to go, but I'll try that at some other point in time (given my unstatisfying single player campaign run). All in all, if you must play this, try purchasing when it is on sale or has a decent discount."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game cost me much to be able toplay when it game out. Had to buy new Video card and memory. the prior game played well. Now after watching hack after hack never bothered, I get Vac banned in error and no one has contacted me in 24 hrs. If they look at my stats alone that proves my innocence- my kill ratio is 70 % of my deaths and my accuracy of gunfire is 8.49%. The way they parcel out maps is like they had rather not have pc folks business. I would like the game ok if they were more responsive and admitted their errors....Might ought to form a classs action law suit....."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Developers of Call of Duty series think that by upgrading a game and making it more futuristic makes a game awesome. For instance, look at Modern Warfare 2, THE BEST GAME FOR EVERYONE. ugh!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst potato simulator ever I would not recomend if your looking for the product on how to become a succseful french fry 10/10 for the music
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME BANS YOU FOR NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ REASON.. I'M A NOOB PLAYER WITH A RARE LUCKY SHOTS, THEN SUDDENLY I GOT PERMANENTLY BAN.. WTF... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it is absolutley â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t so laggy and a never play again for most online gamers. Save you money and dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Barely ever any online games available. If you like Hardcore Team Deathmatch, you might find a game, but other than that, you're pretty much SOL."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This is basically IWs way of telling pc gamers to go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ themselves.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible in its self but on PC it is that much worse. They merely ported it over as quickly as possible and then forgot about it. None of the key bindings are any good and have to all be redone.   Filled with a bunch of DLC to squeeze every penny out of your wallet, another series killed by Activision's selfish greed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the game could have been better if: they did not use steam and used dedicated servers. the lag is just aweful. the amount of hackers and people that has an 'advantage' is growing by the day and steam is steam, they dont give a damn about your gameplay. the antihack does not work, it never has. they ban a few people and a new group is already there. they decided after a while that they will allow you to buy guns (for actual money) i am not an idiot and would not pay a dime more for a stupid game like that. but they gave those people the advantage. there is not one game that i dont get a few minutes of LAG. MW2 was amazing and worked not bad at all. COD4 was the most amazing game, i still play it till this day. reason is dedicated servers, no hackers (or hackers get banned) no lag. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This review is specifically related to the game's optimization (or, should I say, lack thereof). I have a Lenovo Y510p laptop, with two NVidia GT 755M in SLI configuration (not an impressive hardware configuration, but quite respectable). I've managed to play 'Wolfenstein: The New Order' on it's highest settings (on 1920x1080) which is an amazing game by today's standards, but 'Call of Duty: Ghosts' pretty much dies/crashes if I try to do the same. This is, of course, because the game is poorly optimized. I contacted support (btw, amazing support team, Activision) and they asked me to downgrade the resolution until the game would stop crashing, which I found (after a couple of tries) was around 1366x768 (which I later confirmed with NVidia's GeForce Experience tool): This is almost 720p, which makes the game horrible to play due to heavy pixelation. On the other hand, the latest Wolfenstein incarnation was incredibly well optimized, so well that it takes a trained eye to realize where optimization happens (e.g., loading and adapting textures on-the-fly as the player scans the scene).   For a game on this price range, I would have expected a bit more attention to detail: Since not everybody updates their rig every year, optimization should be a non-brainer for developers such as Activision to reach more end users, who would happily pay for a game that works on a decent piece of hardware. It doesn't take a product manager or marketing person, nor an epiphany, to realize this is important.   It's not all the game's fault though : I hope Steam had offered a demo of the game, so that I would have realized about this before buying it (and don't tell me to read the â€œGame hardware requirementsâ€... they are worthless when there are a gazillion combinations of hardware components in a PC that can alter the performance of a rig)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Actual quote from the campaign: 'DAD. YOU. WERE. A. GHOST. QUESTION MARK. I NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN. SURPRISED FACE'  One of the most disappointing Call of Duty games to date. Frequent crashes, poor framerate issues in a graphically unimpressive game, and weird mouse smoothing issues are just a few problems I've encountered within a few minutes of gameplay. Aside from the (extremely) poor optimization for PC, the storyline is dull and the voice acting will often make you cringe at how cheesy it is. Overall the campaign feels rushed, and absolutely nothing about it feels original or new. If you've played Battlefield 3 or 4's singleplayer, you might catch yourself noticing that most of the missions feel like dumbed down versions of that games' campaign missions.  Multiplayer isn't necessarily bad as it is literally nothing new from previous entries. Once again they reorganized the class and leveling system, but the gameplay hasn't changed at all. The maps aren't very good, and most games will consist of you getting shot in the back from someone who just spawned behind you. That's for Team Deathmatch. I would comment on other gametypes, but there never seems to very many people on any other playlist. Multiplayer basically feels like MW3 with better graphics and 'different' weapons.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a stereotypical anti-CoD pc gamer. I was actually really looking forward to ghosts as I was hoping that IW would've learned from their mistakes with MW3 and improve upon their system. Sadly, since West and Zampella got fired it seems Infinity Ward is just a shell of what it used to be, and the IW-made CoD games, which used to be the best ones, are now turning out to be worse than Treyarch's entries.  Unless you are a die-hard CoD fan who isn't interested at all in the story mode or any noticeable changes in gameplay, you'd be better off spending your money on Battlefield 4, a game that actually improved and innovated on its previous entry. Or at least wait for IW to come out with a patch that fixes the frequent crashes and poor graphics optimization. Be careful, though, since IW's focus is on consoles you might be waiting for a very long time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I recommend not getting this on PC, its a poor pc port and a rather disapointing COD game, as the francise slowly goes downhill this has to be one of the worst. short uncompelling story campain that only lasts around 4 hours. No real changes to MP, graphics are poor even with a decent pc, performance is also not great. Really not worth full price. Game now currently unplayable as cant get it to load without it crashing on me, even in safemode. This will be the last COD game I purchase!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not very good terrible graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is a BIG LETDOWN!!!!!! I never used to rage until i played an hour of this game. Those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t moments when u swear u hit them but it doesnt count as a kill. Just watch the kill cam and u will realize u killed em. DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS A WASTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I got bought this game around christmas and with an OK GRaphics card I was never able to play the game. The games PORT was ridiculously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. And only till now when I have upgraded to a standard up to date graphics card am i able to play on it. IF you dont have a beastly GPU dont buy this game.  P.S Im only completing my profile with this review
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Ghosts pretty much sucks, worst one yet in the COD franchise.. Not to mention the laggy servers and cheats that play in them. Activision don't really give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, they are just happy to take your money. Bring on Sledgehammer - Advanced Warfare."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I like more strategic games, but a while back a decided to start playing Battlefield 4, which I bough almost a year back. That got me started on these type of games.   I bought Call of Duty: Ghost as this was the newest game at this point, and my introduction to this series. I can not comment on the previous games but this one sucks big time.  I have endless crashes, and just today already 4 hard-reboots while playing this games. This game have a lot of bugs in it and even on my system of i5, 16G Ram, GeForce 780 OC screen card, I can not set the graphics high. I am now at the end of the final scene and the game keeps on crashing on re-load.  There has been a couple of people who also mention that it becomes very often, very hard to see other players or enemies, unlike BattleField 4.  I can not recommend this game to any player out there, there is too many hardware problems with it. The game it self, is not bad, and if and when there is a new patch I will look at re-playing this games.  I am really dissapointed as this game is so full of bugs that I will not continue with this series."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It OWULD be a great game but they let teh HACKERS ruin it, never banning the clearly hacking players. Some would have 60+ and 1 death with all headshots but still play week after week. Then they rset players who dont hack...god wish we had dedicated servers we can police our own servers."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Optimization is so bad that even on high-end rigs game still stutters. It had so much potential but Activison blew it off by rushing it's port to PC. Honestly i expected much better from Infinity Ward. Probably this game is one of the worst in the franchise.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even though literally every part about it sucks, I'd still play it just because... but it's so bad no one's online.  So basically it's unplayable unless you either want to wait an hour to find a match, or play the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game mode 24/7 with the same people. i am dissapoint. i reaaaaaaally want to like advanced warfare but i can't bring myself to pre order after this pos."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,black ops 2 was my first entry into this series and i loved it  but damn you infinity ward this is the worst call of duty yet!   these lies of needing to have high specs are lies (obviously)  Infinity Ward lied to pc gamers saying that you need at least 6 gb of ram just to run the game it wont let you play if you dont have at least that ammount. if you are going to waste your money on this game buy it for ps3 only   reasons not to buy on other consoles  xbox 360 i hate the controls xbox one only in 720p  ps4 often claimed to lag alot  2/10  1 for somewhat cool concept 1 for doggie
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is great, honestly I really like it but it had a bad start on the PC version. Framrate issues on GOD computers and weird graphical bugs that don't exsist in any of the console versions. The game has been patched a little bit and is WAY better on the PC then it was before but at this point the MP is kinda dead. If there is a sale later on where you can pick it up for $10 or something it would be worth to give it a little play on the campaign and maybe some MP with bots but right now its not worth it. I do however also own the game on Xbox 360 and it is really fun on there and if you own a 360/PS3 or even Xbox One/PS4 I reccommend getting it there. I will however get CoD Advanced Warfare on PC because I think this one will be better optimized because its made FOR next gen and PC where as ghosts was developed for the 360 and ported to the rest of the platforms. So in theory the PC version of AW will be awesome. Hopefully we will get mod tools again like for WaW that is awesome."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,buggy and pathetic... feels like just a console port
Call of Duty: Ghosts,poorly made dont waste your time or money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"don't buy it , IT'S A TRAP!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The game has never worked since I've downloaded it. I've trield all kinds of fixes. It does not work.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The latest installment of the notorious series, Call of Duty, has taken a new turn with IW announcing their new engine. Call of Duty: Ghosts is essentially an OK game for a Call of Duty title, however the lack of enthusiasm to fix the PC version has made me and MANY others quit the game. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU ANTICIPATE DISSAPPOINTMENT. This game is a piece of trash in both gameplay (balancing is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrendous) and now also engine wise. (the new engine is laughable.) There is nothing to CoD anymore, but back in the day, everyone could play it because of it's smooth iD-Engine."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'm lagging, the whole screen is blurred up, and nothing seems to fix it, but looking away from that, It's still pretty bad! If i were to set the price of this game, it would have been 5 euro. I have several indie games that i enjoyed more than this. 3/10 Dragons"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Lousy game, lousy optimisation for PC.  3 words: Don't buy it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This franchise was getting old by the time of MW2. Can't believe I bought this one as well...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Laggy last time i played it! Which is like six months ago since it sux
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Runs like they accidently ported it for Mac and not PC, Unplayable! tried to get a refund after 58mins of gameplay, steam denied the refund. last time i logged in only 1,400 people were online, there's more people playing Atari than this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Only 4 hours of gameplay. Story is rather weak but has it moments,   Graphic is not that bad but in 2014 you may want something more (I grow up with doom etc. so for me it is not an issue), physic and AI is almost non-existent. Forgetable music.  If you like CoD and you find promo -70% / -80% go and buy it but in any other situation - look for something different.  Not bad game but at this price it's a joke."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even this far after launch the game is still extremely buggy. Most of the time it would just crash to desktop with various errors or complain about needing free disk space (with &gt;40GB free). Unfortunately it also seems that they have a save game corruption issue. During the transition after hopping on the train in 'Severed Ties' (Mission 16ish?) it crashed and now when I go into the game, I no longer have the ability to continue my game NOR do I have the ability to replay any of the previous missions I unlocked. I can't recommend that anyone spend money or invest time into a game that has these kinds of issues."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why do I buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ every year (and Battlefield). I tell my self it's for the campaign since i dont even touch the multiplayer most of the times. 60â‚¬ would have bough me like 3 major AAA game during a steam sale. STUPID ME!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this is an extraordinary complex and innovative fps! never before have we seen such a sophisticated, well executed and perfectly tuned shooter.   naaah j/k.   it's call of duty. stupid community of swearing, racist, homophobic and misogynistic 15 y/o, perfectly un-balanced maps and game-breaking weapons (marksman-rifles anyone?) it still has no dedicated servers but this totaly worthless matchmaking system, everyone with a k/d of under 1 is a friggin noob and everyone with above 1.5 a bloody cheater.  this game has a million problems, but the developers rather add snoop dogg as an announcer than dealing with this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   if you like stupid shooters with almost no players other than russians that swear in some crazy language via voice-chat, this is your game!   4/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bought this mainly for the Multiplayer like most other people but i can not enjoy it because it seems that each new COD the Multiplayer Matchmaking gets worse. It was promised to have dedicated servers but its been out for ages with no updates about that. Last COD game i buy ever.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,trailer looks better than game. not recommened
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst COD on history.  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its a waste of money. doesnt even load. requirements my â™¥â™¥â™¥ i just build a 1500 euro pc
Call of Duty: Ghosts,to many hackers and steam dont give a @#$# 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Was great till they decided to add onslaught and remove Hardened and Veteren AI in Squads Wargame to make way for Onlsaught - this now sucks and am very disappointed with this - i would prefer my money back as playing against Regular AI is boring. Playing online has too many cheats. Wargame was the bridge but they have stuffed it now.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"sorry diehards but this COD:GHOSTS SUCKS its been the same flipping game for more the 3 years now bloody hell dont get me started with this pice of SH#T pc port, almost every time i launch the game it crashs my coumpter the pc port SUCKS! I've seen apps better then this pice of sh#t sorry but it is true 0/10 sorry but i mean it   (this should be there add..... IF YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THE SAME PICE OF SH#T GAME THE YOU HAVE AND GO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A ''DIFFERENT'' GAME PICK UP COD:GHOST NOW!)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game Laggs like no other game I played before. It is made for Consoles and you notice it while playing on the PC. The Version for PC is worse than bad. I regret spending so much money for such a bad game like that. Not really much patches for PC, Just a few, not well looking Maps if you dont want to pay !!!50â‚¬!!! per year for a season pass. Lagging like hell and not being fixed, no keys for leaning to the side, instead you just do it automatically, i guess because on the consoles you haven't got enough keys for that. Really, do not buy that game! I mean it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad game in it for your money. Obviously... No interest in PC Gamers.. You will be paying for all extra mini addons... Community is small and every DLC pack is played from a different menu. Basically that will mean with every DLC u get u will also find less people to play with. Its bad .... Really !!  Lots more to write here in negative way but just read the other posts for further explanation. The Soul is gone from the series and it was bound to happen after milking the franchise to come to this game eventually.. Put new people who are passionate about a game behind the wheels and give the guys doing this and falling for the money trap some time off !!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The shitiest cod by far.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this is the worst call of duty i ever played
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Don't waste your money on this...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game it laggs all the time my mouse is jumping and and and f* Activision and infini
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am no gamer but it only took me 18 hours to complete and that was not rushing by any means,unless you want another muliplayer its a waste of money"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not worth it. It's like Skyrim with guns.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This review is for the multiplayer  the multiplayer is good but lacks variety and there is only 2 main teams in multiplayer (federation and ghosts) and the worst multiplayer since mw2 which is bad because people keep using exploits using certain weapons like my personal favourite the ripper my ratig would be 5/10   this is the campaign  the campaign is amazing but inferor to the last C.O.D and has the second best story in the COD franchise in my opinion. this game had a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up ending for a COD game. my rating would be 6/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Crap! Not enough places to climb,some but mostly teasers. Steam crashes all the time while playing,or momentary lagg. Not enough players to play game,significant wait time. Explotiers galore.There seems to be so many cheaters that this could be the reason for the lack of players. People complain but steam dosn't seem to do anything. I played CoD for a long time.I have a number of this franchises games.They are not what they use to be.Now they are bad.  This system will not last if they continue in this direction. I don't recommend the game,and I don't recommend steam."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,when someone askes me to play this game I say 'Noooooooopppe.'
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It starts but when I get to the street thats it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Same old guns, same old gameplay, same old AI. Black Ops was a big step up in terms of story, but Ghosts slides right back into the rut with it's derivative crap. Your attack dog, the most relatable character in the game, is kinda fun and useful; recognising this, the game soon takes it away from you. And the breaching charge scenes will often get you killed if you don't take out your enemies in the right order....and just as often send you back to the start of a long and boring narrative cutscene.  If you're looking for something new and reimagined - shadowy commandos striking swiftly and silently from the darkness in defense of a limping underdog nation, for example (as it was marketed) - don't bother. There's nothing new to see here. Move along."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gutted! I had been looking forward to this game fo a long time and the anti-climax was immense. Real time play is very similar to Black Ops which I didnt like either. It feels 'tinny' and character recognition is rubbish. Weapon selection is also rubbish they all feel the same and the qualification criteria is too long winded. Like the bigger maps thats the only positive I'm afraid. Whilst I understand that there has been hundreds of thousands of man hours put into this production as far as I'm concerned back to the drawing board and bring something out as good as Modern Warfare please. Gaming wise, nothing has come close since its release."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is terrible, it is very bugy, It has a lot of lag, and the sensitvity is a HUGE issue. If you are looking to buy this game for the pc dont even bother the game it self will lag like hell at the beginning and end of the match and Its not on your end I have google fiber optics and I still lag like hell. You better have a controller or you are sure to do a 180 when fighting on multiplayer and get killed.   The Campign is Okay but it may bug sometimes, and you wont be able to go anywhere past the beginning of the mission. When you start the campign be prepared to see missing and glitchy textures I have the game fully donwloaded and some of the brush and ground is missing on Mission 1 and 2.   The Sensitivity is terrible it took me over three hours to tweak it to the perfect sensitvity for me other wise it would be over sensitive or under sensitive (depending on how you play it can take longer to tweak).   Now on to Extinction by far this was my faviorte part of the game, it is the only part working. The game is 'least' buggy here, Sometimes the Aliens will bug out and fall through the ground, some of the guns wont pick up right away but otherwise the gameplay is great for this part, the maps are challanging and the player you encounter are great in this mode.  If you are looking to buy Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts for the Pc it's not worth your time you are really only getting one game mode out of it. You'd be better off buying it for the Console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is full of faults and crashes the lag compensation stinks, the game needs patching. Dont waste your money untill the game has been pached."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Most broken CoD in the history . When I tried to get some answers from Activision they have blocked me on tweeter plus closed my case unsolved :/ Waste of money , waste of time . And it's definately not hardware issue."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Less than a 6 hour campaign. Skip this and grab CoD Black Ops 2. Yes I actually play the single player vs MP. IW why even bother with the SP when you care so little for the campaign?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is an absolute waste. Not only the graphics suck, the story is bad and online is filled with hackers. Really unbalanced online as well. Call of duty is just using their old fans to earn more money, but I'm not going to buy the next game in the series any more."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good graphics, but not much else to enjoy. Story is the same lame american hero/honor crap which is so overused it's nothing more than a pathetic clichÃ¨. Gameplay is pretty much the same we've been doing for a decade, the devs seems to believe that adding the dog is some kind og great innovation, but it really adds nothing to the game. It's just a regular stealth killer, nothing more.  Save your money for something worth paying for. Pretty much anything released this year is better than this crap."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not as good as MW3 tho. it performs like crap
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why bother buying this game. Hardly anybody plays on PC.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nothing Beats the originals
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The multiplayer is *DEAD*. There are only two games types people are playing and they are TDM and Capping points. So disappointed. I got this on sale and im still sad about wasting my money. Best bet would be Warface
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This sucks.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is horrible.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Too many haxxors not being caught/dealt with appropriately.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this game, it's just a broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... Keeps on crashing and still no fix after 9 months... Just don't buy this game just don't. Also the graphics sucks and the campaign is boring and the overall game sucks but what makes it just HORRIBLE IS THE FACT THAT ITS BROKEN. If there was a way i could have got my money back I would have already done it."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Really was apprehensive buying this game since Infinity Ward had disappointed me with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. I bought this instead of Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag because I knew this game would last longer than that game. My thoughts? I honestly think this game is actually bad. The singleplayer may get a little boring and long so don't expect a good, 'story-time.' As for Multiplayer? It's surprisingly alright. I'm having fun playing this game (for now at least.) UPDATE: No. I have dropped this game and want my money back!   My only wishes is that this game (multiplayer) had more players. There simply isnt enough. This game in my opinion is well out of the $60 range. It should be $30 or $40. It simply just isn't worth $60. You're better off buying Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag for $60. But I think its a okay game. Would I recommend it? NO. Don't know, but it really does depend on the type of person you are. Happy Gaming!  UPDATE: Do not buy!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am disappointed of the single played mode. The whole game is a big rush with very little interaction. The game designer made all the decissions for you. I finished the game in six hours. In the previous Call of Duty, the single player mode are excellent and have a purpose. I had not played the multyplayer mode yed because I don't think it offers anythin different than the other multyplayer games. Especilly after what I sow in single play. Very disappointed, I am glad I didn't pay $59.99, it doesn't worth the price. Every new game that is been produced lately is worse than the previous one. "

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"More of the same, minus all the nice pc specific features of Black Ops2, ontop of some ridiculous unfounded pc system requirements for a game that looks marginally better than its predecessor. Avoid at all costs, there are many tremendously better shooters including it's predecessor Black ops2. Keep in mind this is my pc specific opinion. If the game gets properly optimized, an FoV slider and hopefully the ability to run in Dx9, it will then be better though it still feels inferior, the weapon sounds especially are as usual phoned in.  That said the single player campaign is probable the best so far in the series, so if you manage to snag the game on a good sale, it may not be so bad. I would say this game is worth about 20 to 30 bucks at best."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is not a patch on the other Call of Duty Games.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"absolute garbage, can't believe i wasted my money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i have 45 Euro's flusht to the toilet. DX error, DX error, Dx error...bla, bla,la. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ........."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cant get past first screen, there is a Bug that does not allow you to proceed, gets in a loop then says you failed."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"bad game ever   many of errors, freezes, crashes   SLI problem"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not make the mistake of buying this game for pc. Even if you are a CoD fan you will be dissapointed in the extremely sad quality of this PC port, framerate stuttering, lag, and just poor graphics make it almost unplayable. Don't bother"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'll preface everything that I am about to say with the fact that this game could be enjoyable if proper adjustments are made, and that my review only applies to the multiplayer portion of the game.   I'll begin by saying that there are NO DEDICATED SERVERS, at least for PC. If there are some up then they must only be a handful. I say this because the connection does not feel like it would when you connect to a dedicated server most of the time. This is one of the biggest disappointments given that Treyarch made a step in the right direction by giving these to PC players along with SUPERB anti-cheat/hacker monitoring. What's more is that from the comments made within the console community it's apparent that the new generation of consoles seems to be what they are focusing on as most people state that they're connection is much improved from past CODs.  To add insult to injury this game is terribly optimized and has a plethora of problems. People with high-end rigs struggle to run it while people with 1-2 year old hardware seem to be okay (for the most part). The only explanation for this is that IW optimized this game for a very small margin of systems and hoped most other systems would be okay without any tweaking. With SLI I have had issues with textures flickering which at times, ironically, has given me an advantage as I'll be able to see someone through an obejct as the texture flickers.  They're create-a-class system is unnecessarily complicated, IMO, compared to Treyarch's pick 10 system which was streamlined and intuitive. IED's and dogs are two of the most annoying things introduced. The doge's seem to run around mindlessly but when they do attack they lunge from meters away and don't slow down when getting shot unless it's a sniper rifle shot. You should be able to counter a dogâ€™s attack; that would make much more sense. Also, I don't understand why Tac Resist and Blast Shield are 2 points each. They should be 1.5 points max as having these eliminates the frustrations of the constant Flash, Stun, and IED spamming rampant in this game. It's almost impossible to get away from an IED so Sitrep is almost required if you want to avoid them. Given that Tac Resist and Blast Shield are two points each it's almost necessary to run specialist to have these perks plus a few others to make the game tolerable.  Net code on a 'listen server' is not improved over MW3 and it shows as you get shot around corners. Sometimes the lag compensation will be on your side, but I'd rather the game be an even playing field from the start instead of sometimes being at a disadvantage and other times being Neo from the Matrix. I'd say wait until there are at least more dedicated servers up. If that happens the glitches and other nuisances can be tolerable, but this game definitely isn't worth it's price tag on PC.  --UPDATE-- So I upgraded my rig for BF4 (P9X79 MOBO, 32 GB RAM, Intel 4930k @ 4.125MHz, and 2 Superclocked 780's in SLI) and this game still stutters when I play it. I need to turn things down which I find ridiculous and a show of just how much effort went into the PC port of this title.  TL;DR: No native FoV changer, FPS seemingly locked around 90 FPS, RAM limitations (why? who knows), Poorly optimized (one of the worst ports to PC in the series to date), few or no dedicated servers even though they were promised, unreasonable price tag for how this plays. Don't buy."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's ridiculous how Infinity Ward managed to regurtitate the same franchise over and over, gain success, but suddenly crashes and burns. This is exactly how Call of Duty: Ghosts feels like - a bigger slap than what Modern Warfare 2 is to Call of Duty 4.  Single player offers the exact, same plot as the previous titles did (don't get fooled by the 'underdog' title), with just a little mix and matching between Modern Warfare/Black Ops titles. And you father in-game dies in the most cliched way possible. I mean, you simply haven't been presented with a way to connect with the guy, other than calling him 'dad' (just kidding, you're *surprise!* mute). No character depth whatsoever. Even the main villian is straight out of recent hollywood flicks - disgruntled former military person gets left behind and holds a grudge? Please.   Expect guns, goons and gratuitous explosions, but it just feels like the same CoD experience you had in the last 6 years. But you get to control a dog. Is that a good point? Frankly, no, since it's the same 'go-to-this-checkpoint-while-we-the-developers-make-sure-you-don't-get-spotted-at-all' kind of thing.   Ooh, and SPACE! You get to have firefights in space. Which is a little cool, if it's not frustratingly hard to find and pop out of cover due to your altered acceleration/deceleration. But you're in space. So I'll let it slide.  Multiplayer is an even bigger letdown, with massive latency issues and ill frame rates. Not to mention the maps, that are seemingly carbon copies of the map Downturn in MW3. It sucked not only in visuals, but also in map layout - it's like they're expecting everyone to either camp or run as a Maniac. Every map in Ghosts is like that, I swear. 'Dynamic' maps are supposed to break that habit, but considering that's only one map (a pre-order bonus, at that), you'd think they should've done a good job. Except they didn't. Because it's not dynamic, it's just a heavily-scripted, moving-platforms version of (yes) Downturn!  Overall, kudos to the space concept (a nice surprise, actually), but the rest just falls down hard. I regret pre-ordering this on retail, and I guess, I'm just lucky to have bought the Standard edition.  YES * High production value on set-pieces (especially the space parts) * Great graphics  NO * Single-player campaign drags on * Utter reliance on set-pieces instead of great gameplay * Crappy support for low-end systems * Multiplayer maps are terribad * You'll lag hard on multiplayer  Verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothing new here as has been the case for along time with COD however I usually get my moneys worth from COD each year when I want to play a mindless fps every so often. That being said this one is horrible in a number of ways. While the single player game is what you would expect and is entertaining to play sitting on the couch in front of my big screen. The multiplayer more frustrating than ever before.   - FOV  - There is no FOV slider and even with the 3rd party ones it looks horrible. It may just be me but it looks like the image is 720p and upscaled on my 1080p 27' monitor when I set the FOV to 90 or 100 - MP gameplay you die fast  - Hits on you don't register until you are already dead with no way to retalitate. If you watch the kill cam your enemy will have gotten 9 hits on you but from your perspective only 3 registered before you are dead. Someone posted a good video about this on youtube.  Audio  - Unlike COD MW3, where you could select from a variety of audio options such as stereo, 5.1, etc.. This does not include any of those. While that might seem like a minor grap it would be nice considering I have a decent paid of headphones with 7.1.    Unlike others, I have only experienced minor technical issues but I have already uninstalled the game. This game will be down to $30 in no time (have seen it already for $48 on GMG)."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Poorly optimized garbage. I can run Black Ops 2 at 120 frames per second maxed except for anti-aliasing, but this doesn't even hold 40. Turning down video options does not significantly improve fps and makes the game look awful. The FOV is capped at 65 and it makes me feel like I'm running around with binoculars strapped to my face. This is marketed as the 'next gen' Call of Duty, but it doesn't look significantly better than previous titles and the gameplay remains pretty much the same, except with this iteration it's slower paced, the maps are bigger, and the player cap is lower, which makes for an overall boring experience. Skip this one."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its really bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is so bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game on PC. Mostly because the community on PC is very small. Most of the time there's not even enough people to find a good game on ground war. Only TeamDeathMatch and Domination have enough people playing at all time. The single player campaign is fun but way too short. Unless you play only TeamDeathMatch and during peak hours, I recommend this game on console."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The inability to change your Field Of View bothers me, even though it's a easy fix by downloading a third-party program I think there's no excuse to not include it in this game.. ESPECIALLY since it was available in previous Call of Duty games. The campaign? I enjoyed it a lot, just that the ending was pretty stupid in my opinion.. If you know what I mean, it was all great until those last like 20 seconds.. But I guess that's there way of making an excuse for a sequel. So onto the multiplayer, it's pretty much the same. Except, Infinity Ward changed how the perks work which I really really like, but I feel like you run out of perk combonations relatively quickly through-out playing the game. I also think there's not enough game modes, and there's not enough guns. I mean-- I thought there was supposed to be a new engine.. So wouldn't that allow more content? Right right? Nope! Apparently not. The character customization is different, but not *that* great.. I mean it's not like anyone was begging for it, I think it's just another gimmicky feature added to try and reel people into buying their game in my opinion. The extinction mode is cool, but nothing new. They should really just make those survival modes Call of Duty makes standalone games.. I mean, aliens are a baby step away from zombies but at least they introduce different kinds of them you have to take down, instead of them just getting more health every round. I've heard it's similar to Gears of War's survival mode but sadly I wouldn't know, I've only ever played it once and I vaguely remember my experience. As far as I remember, you could buy defenses and guns just like in this but whatever.  Overall? It's an ok game, it's a Call of Duty game. Definately not worth 60 dollars, wait until the price drops on black friday if it even does but I highly doubt it. I wouldn't really recommend this game to anyone, it's just a game I have for when I get bored of other first-person shooters. Spend you money wisely!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the first CoD I bought and it will be the last one (from Infinity Ward). While TreyArch made a 'great' game with Black ops 2 I really enjoyed playing, at a friends, I decided to get my hands on my first own CoD, Ghosts that is, but they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up so hard. Not only there is no FOV changer, what I kind of understand because the consoles don't have it either and I think they wanted to be 'fair', however it is also so bad ported onto the pc that it's unplayable, even on high end PCs. The multiplayer is fun at times even with the laggs and fps crashes so that's at least one plus point. The graphics are nothing phenomenal, they look worse than the ones in Crysis 1 , and are never worth around 26 GB of space. Let's get to the single player *sigh*. It's your standard action-fps. Not good story telling, gets boring pretty quickly and you don't get any emotions towards the characters but everyone knows that CoD is a 'multiplayer game' and no one buys it only for the really awesome campaign. Although CoD isn't the best singleplayer game it is so good because of the multiplayer but as I said they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up aswell so there is really no point in wasting your money just wait for the next.   FINAL VERDICT: 5.5/10 DON'T buy this game. As I enjoy it from time to time I just can't recomend this to anybody right now if you really want to buy it no one is going to stop you but I will never buy anything that is programmed by IW. I've learned my lesson. At least TA tries to make a stable pc port but I'm going to wait for what's coming and meaybe they fix it.  Graphics   + (They improved and it looks really pretty sometimes, even though the grass remembers me on WarZ)  Gameplay  + (Smooth and makes fun as always, if you're lucky and it doesn't lagg)  Singleplayer  - (Really poor 5 hours for a full price 59â‚¬/69$ game)  Story   - (As I said it's a poor told story)  Performance  - (SO BAD PORTED I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP, nuf said)  Weapons  +/-(There could be some more but they're somewhat acepptable)  Sound  + (The weapons and the charactors at least sound really good)  Atmosphere  + (Good war atmosphere, at least)  Multiplayer  + (It's good, makes fun and is competitive but you get killed way too quickly and there is this ping/host problem)  Personally  - (I'm really sad it turned out like this I paid for it was really excited and in the end I can't even play it on the   lowest settings without laggs, even if they say I'm able to play it on medium. The performence issues ruined   this game in my eyes)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Mediocre single player experience. It's essentially one big turret mission. Turgid. Enjoyed World at War and Black Ops single player more than this. Multiplayer is much of the usual frantic running around and shooting. Regret buying this. Bought into the hype again.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD: Modern Combat Unrefined would be a great alternate title for this game. I don't blame activision for this monstrosity of a game, I blame Infinity Ward. I'd bet my left nut that when Treyarch gets COD back in their court that the game will be phenomenal once again. Until then I hope BF4 will be able to fill the gap for you all."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,YOU CANT PLAY IT IF YOU TRY YOU GET RAM PROBLEM AND IF YOU FIX IT IT CRASHES
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Nope. Nope.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The worst Call of Duty game in the franchise. No innovation or creativity. Also, it has one of the worst endings I've ever seen in gaming."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Bad gameplay Not that many weapons in online mode  i would say 0 out of 5 stars its the worst game in cod series
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After about a month or two, the game because unplayable because of memory issues, even though I have top of the line hardware (i7, GTX780, and 8GB RAM). I've scoured the internet for fixes but haven't found any. This game was a disappointing waste of money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Horrible.. IF i bought this game on it's own, I'd be insanely irritated and a lot more critical of it, Considering I got it in the franchise pack during Activision's Anniversary Sale, I won't say the pack was a waste of money but this game is horrible, I've never seen it run the way it's intended to, Audio cuts out during cutscenes and even in the menus, the game has an obvious unfixed memory leak issue which causes the game to immediately devour well over 2,000,000k of RAM and continue climbing.. I've also heard a lot about CPU spikes when this happens but i've never actually had any issues with my Intel I7 3620QM and this game, The problem is with leaking ram to the point I can barely load task manager with 8gb of 1600mhz DDR3 RAM.. I own this game for both Xbox 360 and Xbox One, sadly this is the worst version of the game, If you own a console and this game is on sale it's worth a buy there but this version is an unstable piece of trash.. IF Neversoft and Activision decide to finally fix the sound cuts and mass RAM leakage I'll edit my review and I would actually reccomend the game if you want to kill aliens.. Otherwise don't buy it the multiplayer is trash, the game isn't near what it is on console and definitely should be considering it runs perfectly fine on an xbox 360 for it to fail on my PC running well over 4x the power is unreasonable.. If you have 16gb of ram the ram leak may not effect you if you're running 8gb don't even buy the game, If you expect the standard of performance seen on console or for that matter every other cod game on this platform - Do not buy it  Pros: Extinction is fun..  Cons: Unstable Trash Ram Leak (Near unplayable) CPU Leak (Heresay) Audio Cuts (Quite inconvenient for extinction and modes you get updates from your player and the other players on the map) Another space age call of duty We were promised a fix about a year ago for the first 4 issues however one still has not been released. Support for this game is horrendous as with every other activision title we get the 'Silent Treatment'  I'll conclude by saying if it's in the franchise pack it's not reason not to buy that pack, but this game is trash DO NOT expect the game to work unless activision has finally fixed this unplayable garbage."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the steam engine sucks. the game kinda sucks i have two accounts. I would like to combine them but theres no one to talk to, and i don't see a way just to email just to get someone to talk to. So the whole thing sucks. years ago i used to like this game but this game engine sucks "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst Call of Duty game ever!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Horrible Just Horrible 0/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I really don't know what to make of the CoD franchise.While playing Ghosts, I constantly feel like I'm watching hundreds of thousands of dollars burn away in front of me. Each scene is so grand, so flashy and fantastical that I can't say I've seen much like it in any other series.  And yet, I'm walking down the same corridor shooting the same 'bad guys' with a machine-gun I can't remember the name of. It's abysmally mindless, and I'm left wondering how this could possibly be the most popular, best selling bunch of videogames on the market. What if something intelligent had this sort of budget? What if Vampire Bloodlines, Armored Core, Deus Ex or S.T.A.L.K.E.R (to name a few more interesting games from the top of my head) had this sort of money to blow on grandiose environments and production? Sure, it's in the name of accessibility, but I feel like I'm being treated like an idiot by the game.  It's the equivalent of a Michael Bay film -- fool the audience with flashy explosions so they don't question the content behind them. It's dull, repetitive, and I have to say I'm a little disappointed that this is the new norm."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Gameplay: 1/10 Campaign: 6/10 Doge: much/wow
Call of Duty: Ghosts,like cod but this one with no dedicated servers and bug fixes was a bit off a let down)-:
Call of Duty: Ghosts,YOU CANT PLAY IT IF YOU TRY YOU GET RAM PROBLEM AND IF YOU FIX IT IT CRASHES
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game....is lacking. That's all I can say for it. Games like MW2 and MW3 were fun because most of the things in those games were relatively new. Ghosts came after Black Ops II and was basically a remaster of the Modern Warfare games, but with tactical sliding added. I do not recommend this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is a tough one for me, do I enjoy playing online? the answer would be yes and no, Like all CODs it is plauged by not having dedicated servers which means depending on who is hosting you can have an advantage or dissadvantage many times I have thought I was the first to see and shoot a player but then watching the kill cam the enemy clearly had a drop on me, this can be extremley frustrating at times but it wil happen on both sides. Single player mode was pointless in my view granted I won't be to judegemental as I can say it only kept my attention for about 2 hours, if you are a fan of the franchise you probablly wont have any issues with this game. If you are not I would stay away  PROS -Fast run and gun style game play -Feels just how you would expect a COD game to play -Diverse classes and weapons -Awesome perk system  CONS -Controls are clunky and not optimzed for PC -Lack of players, the game has been out for almost a year and you wont find more than about 1,000 players online -Graphics, they are what you would expect from an xbox360 I see no jump from COD4 to this title -No dedicated servers -Host changing stops game play for up to 1 minute -No multiplayer balancing you can play games with 2 on 8 -Most weapon skins and reticles are only for purchase -Handicap from low rank to high rank to far apart  To sum it up, yes I do enjoy playing this time to time but there is no way it is worth $59.99 if this were to go on sale under $25 it would be worth picking up, otherwise hang tight for a few months until BO3 is released"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's been a month and I'm still getting servers unavaible message. The campaign was meh but the multiplayer is why we buy this and it doesn't work for me therefore I can't recommend it.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible pc optimization...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I love the COD series, Iâ€™ll admit it, I prefer it to the Battlefield gamesâ€¦ that said, I wish Iâ€™d skipped this one. This is a top whack game for a top whack price that will leave a distinctly brown taste in your mouth. The single player isâ€¦ well â€œmehâ€ at best, yes, there are parts were you can play as a dog, and thereâ€™s the usual heroic story too but really, whatâ€™s new? Itâ€™s prettier I guess (if you ignore the bugs)â€¦ The multiplayer is painful! Infinity Ward (as it is now) seems to have played BO2 and taken all the worst bits and made them into Ghostsâ€¦ The maps are very sniper/camper friendly, the weapons seem to be unpredictable in their balance and your progression through the ranks is completely separate to your progression through the weapons. You simply unlock the weapon you want with squad points that you earn at random (or thatâ€™s how it feels). Most of my friends have returned to BO2 and, to be honest, I think Iâ€™ll be heading that way tooâ€¦ I certainly wonâ€™t be buying the expansions and so onâ€¦. This is one to pick up on the cheap in a sale!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Insanely bad stuttering, sadly it cant even reach its own 'CoD' standards..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Let's keep it short and sweet - worst CoD to date. Save your money or spend it on anything else. By buying this pile of c...p you're basically throwing your money out the window.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The campaign is fun enough - but if you're a fan of the Call of Duty series the multiplayer is a horrible broken mess (mechnically and buggy) that will only end in frustration. Better sticking with one of the older titles you haven't played yet.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Singleplayer experience was ok, multiplayer mode had a load of initial bugs i had to figure out to work around, the game plays well online but sadly the biggest fail is the fact that there is no anti-cheat system apparently in place and there doesnt seem to be much done about hackers, its to the point where the hackers dont even try to hide what they are doing, the killcams reveal many players wallhacking and aimbotting. I still have some hope for the game once all these issues are looked into. Other than that I say Save your money for now and wait for all these problems to be fixed, spare yourself the trouble."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is prolly one of the worst modern warfares I have ever played. The maps excessively big and to few players. They incourage camping. Ontop of that, sli users or even someone with a really good computer cant run this game on full settings. Its Poorly optimized. Stay away from this game or any infinity ward games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,".....just started playing COD Ghosts and in the ' Locate Almagro ' level game doesn't load properly and so I'm unable to continue, if I go too far on the map I get a kill screen saying ' Stay with your Allies for protection ' and the level starts over. I was told to reinstall game which took two days with Steam download, still has same problem. I guess I'll have to wait for a patch to come out if it does before I can actually get what I paid for!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Could have done better (same with the other ones) Nice graphics but do something new!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game wont even freaking work on my computer waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Not the greatest game that COD have made but fun in its own way. If you are going to buy it now or in the future just wait for COD:AW as i am thinking that might bring the OCd community up.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Not worth it at 60, but on the positive there were many improvements to the non-dlc weapon buying system. also: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DLC FOR DAYS! WHY????? every single CoD that's recent has this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Most bugged out the â™¥â™¥â™¥ game i've ever played in my life.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Since I bought this game it has not started at all. I followed online instruction checked in many ways and many times, I still can not play it. and I found that its really hard to get any one to speak with. not satisfy with customer service as well. Paid such price for this game just waste my time and money. I was really interested in Call of Duty series. not now"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,in this game the SP will make you feel over powerd mother f*ckers but the multiplayer will make you feel Suckers its a total waste of money the story is fun but ultra short and the multiplayer is buggy as hell just another overratted cod game ...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you haven't got this game yet then don't bother. Rather wait for Advanced Warfare or get a previous game like Black Ops and Black Ops 2 etc. Poorly optimised, a lot of lag, a lot of rage, no dedicated servers and mouse acceleration is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"COD:Ghost is a sheer disappointment. COD:Ghost feels like a cliche. COD series has stayed virtually the same since COD:Modern Warfare. Previously the grandeur of a scripted single-player and a competitive and fun muti-player make up for its' lack of astounding graphic, and yet the developers insist on using the same engine, while failed to innovate the COD:Modern Warfare era muti-player. COD:Ghost marked the end of the resplendency of the COD series. If the developers keep falling at innovation and graphic improvement, this series is soon to collapse."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"CoD: Ghosts is extremely lackluster. It lacks CS:GO's competitiveness and feels like a spawn--&gt;kill--&gt;get shot, rinse and repeat every 10 seconds."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The PC port for this game sucks... On consoles this game is very fun but, on PC lags,frez,frame drops... This game is not doing well on PC..."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The worst CoD in history. Seriously! You cant even level up. You cant play because of lag. If you ever buy a copy burn it. And if you bought a digital version burn your computer before its corrupted with stupidity
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Recycled, hacked, featureless, bugged, story less, Patriotic Yippee ki-yay crap fest. The live action trailer is better then the game itself!. Dont bother."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It's call of duty. A bad game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no need to buy blops 2 is better and that game still sucked.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Its an alright game I guess, its more realistic but the gameplay is bad, the maps arent too good and extinction mode is way too hard. The only good thing about this game is the campaign, its better than all the other cods campaigns.If you want a game just for the campaign and single player, definatly get this but if you want it for the online get black ops 2 or Modern Warefare 3. Personally I'd give it a rating of 4.5/10."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"A horribly optimized game that requires a community-made program to increase the FOV from the measly 65 degree default. Activision has shown no interest in fixing any issues within the PC version and that attitude doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. The handful of patches released so far have not made any improvements whatsoever. Buying the game right now would be a complete waste of money, both because of all the technical issues and the already rapidly declining playerbase. It took Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 nearly 8 months to bleed as many players as Ghosts has lost in less than a month."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"In a market where the gaming dollar is strecthed thinner everyday. Activision has released what feels like an incomplete insult to the gaming community.   I have never been the largest COD player, I surely fall into the casual section for this titles but none the less I have played all the predecessors and while not all have been perfect gems none have been a complete lump of coal like this one.   Poorly optimized, bad balancing, boring story, and just a lackluster effort all together,   In the end thats what turns me off the most is that in this Market Activision feels that we MUST buy COD. so their doesn't seem to be any effort.   COD Ghosts 1/5   Check out my other reviews and add me."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Well all I can say is just please don't ever buy this game, a month after release it is still unplayable. I have a pretty decent pc (can run blops 2 pc on high settings at 120fps) yet this game on low settings struggles to hit 40 frames. Their are no dedicated pc options whatsoever, no fov slider, dedicated peak around corner keys, no true dedicated servers (disgracefully slow server, p2p hybrid bs), 60GB install file for a game which even on the highest settings still doesn't look overly special - just a few more shades of brown and grey. The gameplay itself is the slowest in the franchise, with the worst spawn point system conceivable in a game. Wish I had seen reviews of this game before (ie the modal score of 0/10 on the metacritic website). So yeah, last time I give these crooks any money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Pros: The name  Cons: Every thing  1/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst f)(* game ever! Not even talking about the sh@ty graphics engine, I'm talking about the game as a whole. Thank you steam for your no refund policy...enjoy my wasted money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I usually enjoy the yearly installment of Call of Duty, but this game is horrible. Avoid at all costs."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,that was terrible...after all the sesquels and versions they still haven't fixed the dumbest and poorest designed aspects. DO NOT BUY. To the Developers...go the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ outside...morons.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,the game is good. Nice SP and robust MP but feels like we got some performance problems.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I am not a huge fan of Call of Duty anymore, but this game is just awful.  They some how managed to remove many features that they added in the previous game, as well as give the game worse textures.  Not only that, but the game runs horrible. Online is also very unplayable and laggy.  I would highly suggest not buying this game. It's not worth it. It needs so much work to be playable."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Single Player While I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign story, the gameplay itself however is very simple. The game holds your hand throughout the levels leaving very little room for you to find/figure things out on your own.  Multiplayer The multiplayer is like every other CoD game, few enhancements, minor tweaks, lots of bugs, many people complaining. The initial start off was, and probably still is, plagued by bloated MIN requirements, constant FPS drops despite having a decent rig, aimbots/wallhacks/boosters, random CTD's and no dedicated servers. There are a handful of people that have gotten lucky and don't have any issues running the game though.  Overall, there are too many problems with Ghosts right now to consider this a good buy. I'm glad I bought this game at a deep discount but still regret spending $35 for it. 6/10 "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,its ok def not what it was hyped up to be. battlefield 4 far surpasses cod ghosts in both graphics and gameplay. and i was a die hard cod fan untill this. i lost all faith in infinity ward and hope that they get it right sooner or later and stop remaking the same game over and over and over and over again. will not buy the next COD game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"the technical flaws drag this game down. it has a good story, good voice acting, and good action. but it feels like a step back from the overall quality of black ops II. graphics quality is decent but nowhere as good as battlefield 4. it does not live up to the hype."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The latest iteration of Call of Duty does not make fundamental changes to its aging formula, nor its less and less impressive graphics, despite entering a new console generation. Activision beware: sans changes, even the CoD series is going to enter a downward slope soon."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,*disappointed sigh*
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Infested with hackers and ruining the experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I did not enjoy this game before I played Call of Duty Black opps 2 and I still do becouse there are a number of problems with Ghost mutiplayer.  1; The field of view is to small no pc version only 65 was 90 in BO2  2; Moving in the game is like walking in syrup  3: Grafics or not better but worse then in BO2  4: Sound is really bad comparte to BO2  5: Mouse setting are allmost impossible to get right  If I could I would ask my money back now I still play BO2 is still best COD game.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game sucks, it innovates jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and has a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port for PC. Horribly optimised, constant mouse acceleration, NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FOV CHANGER, 6GB ram my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The campaign is laughable, just another Micheal Bay movie; lots of explosions and a a terrible story that tries to make you bond with characters before killing them off (real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing smooth infinity ward) but failing horribly at making you feel sorry for a main character's death after having him seen for about 15 minutes screen time total. in short: THIS GAME SUCKS GIANT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, DON'T BUY IT. /rant"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i dont like it. the guns kill way to quickly. the spawns can be annoying. not as annoying as how big the maps are. it seems painful to level your character. if you dont know what youre doing you can waste a lot of time and resouces.   its cool to take the next step and be innovative but this was a painful one.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What could have been a great game has turned out to be a disapointing mess.Before the latest patch the game was playing pretty well with minor performance issues everything maxed out,since the patch it is a terrible mess and my system is more than the recommended specs for this game.On the plus side the graphics are very good with a not to bad story line,the mutiplayer is typical COD fashion but at this current moment in time alot of players are reporting cheating.I was looking forward to getting this game and now feel abit disapointed by it.If they were to sort out the gameplay performance issues and control the servers better then I would recommed this game.At this moment in time with the problems the game has I chose not to recommed it until they can sort the issues out most of the players are facing.I would save your money at this moment in time and wait until they patch the game to make it run as it should."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So, if this is 'next-gen' in Activision's mind, then I fear for the future of that company, because it is not only not an improvement on the previous title (Black Ops II), but it is a bad game. The graphics are no better, and the lack of colour in the environments makes the game look worse than BO2. The gameplay is boring, with the changes to the multiplayer reverting back to the inferior MW3 system, and in other cases breaking them all together. There is no FOV option, which makes it painful to play unless you use the recently C&amp;D'd FOV changer tool for the title, but even with this the aim-down-sites FOV is still painfully low, meaning it is still unplayable. The single player is dire. Squads is not even remotely interesting. The survival alien mode is no where near as good as zombies, and the game is generally uninteresting. Also, it is terribly optimised, meaning barely any GPUs can actually get stable framerates, and the 6GB ram requirement (along with the 50GB install limit I suspect) is completely artificial in nature, and is only there for Activision to pretend this game is 'next-gen'! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you want Call Of Duty, buy COD4 if you want something competetive, or Black Ops 2 if you want something dumb and mildly amusing. Ghosts is a waste of money and time, and I would get a refund if I could."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's not that bad as a game, but it feels like a cheesy 20$ shooter. Short, buggy and uninteresting story. If you plan on playing multiplayer, stay with Black Ops 2 and if you wanna try because it you want to see some next gen graphics, buy Battlefield 4."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"good story conpeared to other call of duty's  --DO NOT BY if you are wanting to play MULTIPLAYER-- thire are to meny bugs with the game like hackers, connection issues   and general bugs that have not been sorted at all"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nothing more to say. Bad FPS, takes too long to find lobbies, overall failure for PC."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"BUG, LAG, CHEATERS ! Get my money back !"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Do not buy this game, totally waste your money. I've bought this game for a month and still can't launch, crash immediately after launch!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod ever dont buy it .. go for bf4
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Runs horribly, I can play battlefield 4 with a higher FPS than this."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I do not recommend this game. IW seems to have failed in properly making good textures for 'next gen' appeal. As far as PC is concerned, graphics is definitely not a selling point. Jagged edges and unfinished looking objetcs in the world steal the immersion that I was expecting.  Let us now talk about multiplayer. The CoD franchise has done little to change things up, a tired engine being used again and again with a few tweaks (such as being able to slide and lean around cover). For me in particular, the biggest game changer is the lack of heavy hitting, high risk/high reward killstreaks. The AC-130 is gone. Instead, a Helo Pilot killstreak attempts to take its spot, and it fails miserably. Piloting it feels as though the game does it for me and the weapons equipped are lack luster; the shock and awe is just not there.  The one good change is the emphasis on gunplay. Since killstreaks do far less, it is now more in the hands of the player to play the objective and rely on gunplay with tactics to win and do well.  As for the single player, it is a roller coaster. High thrill moments at times marred by moments when the game does too much for you. Not enough choices in the campaign to influence any outcomes, your squad mates do much of the heavy lifting for you, and many times the cinematic cutscenes allow little to no interaction. I do not like just sitting and watching a video game being played for me, IW.  I give this game a 4.5/10. There is much to be desired and it often feels like a free to play game - a bad one.  "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Sadly, this is the first CoD game I cannot recommend, at least to Radeon GPU users. I have a Core i5 2500k, Windows 8-64 bit, 8 GB RAM, and a Radeon HD 6850 that plays every game I throw at it at near max graphics settings (Black Ops 2, Crysis series, Battlefield series) with ease. However, even though I've had Ghosts for 6 months now, I'm unable to play for more than 5-10 minutes before the whole game freezes with 'fatal error' and 'device hung' messages, no matter how much I experiment with lower graphics settings. I seriously doubt Infinity Ward/Activision are ever going to patch it at this point. Seems like they would have done it by now. What a giant waste of $60. Also, in the limited time I have played between crashes so far, it definitely feels like a port from consoles. Will this be the last CoD I ever buy????"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no offline play
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Gameplay - 10/10 Quality of Port - 10/1000000, Just terrible!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,nothing but cheats and nobody gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Let me tell you something. Here new titles cost 75$. Is this game worth 75 dollars? No. It's worth 15. Why? It's a horrible PC port with frame rate issues out of the â™¥â™¥â™¥ left and right. The cheating is insane and lag is real. Washed out graphics and very poor gun choice. If you have an option to buy any COD you should consider Black Ops 2 or something else. Just not this. This is just bad.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,So I quit halfway through the compaign as it was boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.. Call of Duty: Ghosts was such a pile of garbage; who am I kidding? This game still is a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I regret pre-ordering this pile of horse manure. Infinity Ward as a company is a mentally defective pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is one unpolished piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Gotta say, it was alright at first. Broken, but playable. Both Solo and multi were tolerable. And still worth a low cost buy. Now? after all these BS 'update patches' I can safely say this is another COD game that just keeps getting worse instead of better. If you like throwing money away, by all means. But this series has turned into a played out joke. The same BS every year. And this installment is no exception. as of 2/1/14? This is one broken, laggy, frame drop filled, modder infested FAIL. 4.5/10  However, you do have an occasional good game. So if your a cod fan and you can get this one for ender 30.00 might as well go for it. :P"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible lag after the first week of release and poor security. The game was sold half-baked
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is amazing. Amazing the fanchise isn't dead yet...
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Awful settings, Ugly on max settings, This is really pathetic."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is horrible, highly hyped up and anticipated and strongly let down. The servers suck, the community sucks, this game; the worst. I've never felt more regret in my life than i did buying this game for 60$. I even emailed the company trying to get a refund for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i mean i guess it's good i havent played much of the single player but i bit on the multiplayer and its ok but it looks absolutly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and thne you move the mouse to fast it speeds up lke it doesnt want me to get a kill or somthing i dont have much good to say but dont buy this its not worth like 70$ nzd i got it for 26$ thats ok but get black ops 1 or mw2 or 3 or somthing good for your money not this    4/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Expensive game for so little  Single player story mode is good but feelt i was missing half of it... and it was over so fast... a bit disappointed after 4 hours where i completed it  Multiplayer story mode... i havent really gotten what the story there is... But my connection is bad anyway so i just found the uninstall button  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The positive aspects of call of duty ghosts are:  - better hit detection tham others cods - caracter customization - class setup - good weapon balance   The negative aspects of call of duty ghosts are:  - no theater mode - IED is anoying and ruined the game - Dog is op for a 5 killstreak reward, they nerf it but just after 9 months after the game realesed - maps are big and full of camping spots that ruined the game - fied order is not so good compared to care package - the engine for pc is broken and the experience to play decent required a lot of changes on video configuration even though some cpu lag is present - the game overall was design for low past gameplays and for camper players  Despite the negatives aspects of call of duty ghosts overcame the positive, this game is only recomended for those who are adict to call of duty franchise, otherwise stay away from it.  6 out 10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Amazingly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  I thought it was impossible to release a game worse than no game at all.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I just got this game for multiplayer and extinction but hardly good matches are ever found not enough players online to enjoy the whole ghost experience.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why is this even on steam Gabe you have dissapointed me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO not buy this SH8. it's not worth the money or the effort. lo player count on servers and campers in every corner.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,not the best game but atleast a good story.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty: Ghosts is very similar to other COD games, but it is very buggy, to the point that I clearly feel ripped off paying for a game that is half baked, at best. It crashed my computer several times, had a horrible graphic glitch that made the game almost unplayable, and loading times were veeerrrryyyy loooonng - even installed on an SSD. I spent hours looking for a solution to the graphic issues only to find a lot of people in the same situation - no support from Activision or the developer. Definitely NOT recommended - DO NOT BUY!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same Sh!t. This should be called MW4. activision can go Fu*k them selves because they really Fu*ked up this time. This sh!t is worse than Black ops II
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Please don't get this game, it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke. I like CoD and I might even be a fanboy of it, but over 50 hours played, I have came to a conclusion.  This game is an absolute piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this only good thing about it is the doge.  If you want a good CoD Game, pick up a copy of Black Ops II, one of my favorite games."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Worst off the worst! If you buy this game youre an idiot, and i will come into your bedroom at night and penetrate you for buying this game! Trust Me! That was what happened to me when i buuyed this game! The game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed me in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ because it sucked so much! Its worse than eetee the extra terrestrial!   I juust hate this game so hard!!!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the most horible game I've ever bought, smh and these updates aren't solving the on going problem.  I'm deffinantly not pre-ordering another Call of Duty game ever! Some beta testing would be great in solving this crap for a game sad just sad.  IW needs to get it together."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game would maaaybe be worth buying if it is on sale for like $10. The install is huge, it is poorly optimaized, the graphical fidelity is just atrocious, and after looking through countless forums on steam and variuous websites, I still can't get the multiplayer to work. Overall, a terrible PC game. Do not buy unless discounted to the point of single digit dollars."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After two playthroughs (separated by over a year), this game still suffers from horrible PC performance issues (i.e. extremely poor optimization). Granted Crunch's computer hardware is a bit dated, however even with the graphic settings as low as they can go, framerates would range from over 100fps to under 10fps in very short order. He experienced lag during supposed decent framerate periods and astonishingly mission load cut scenes. WTF?! And everytime he adjusted the graphics settings (in a frustrating and almost futile attempt to get a decent, reliable framerate) the game has to replay the mission cut scene with no option to skip. It appears little effort was put into making a decent PC port or into quality control. Crunch experienced nothing but aggravation trying to play this game (one of the few games that consistent frustrated him to the point of wanting to put his fist through something).  Even IF the story was extremely compelling and well-crafted (and there are plot-holes almost from the very start), Crunch cannot recommend this game on the continuing (and likely never to be fixed) performance issues. Crunch gives it a 4.0/10 and that is being generous.  NB Because of such poor game performance and no resolution from the developer/publisher, Crunch will NOT be purchasing or playing CoD games anymore. So, he has uninstalled all his CoD. If Activision either resolves gameplay issues or drastically improves the quality of published games on day 1, Crunch might change his mind. MIGHT! He will also be cautious about buying games from the same companies."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DLC useless, refund?"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is terrible, only reason i have those hours is because im making the best outta the wasted money i spent.... seriously dont buy this game!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"After spending some hours (with some I mean quite a bunch), I've came up with this conclusion: - no love from Activision and it's clear from the very beginning - you cant choose a map nor a server: you will end up in the worst ping-wise and with your most hated map - perks... Yeah, let's give you the 'official Wall Hack' so you cant discern anymore who cheats from who does not - lag lag lag and then lag, but not the lag you suffer for your poor connection, but the HARDWARE LAG. This game is capable of knock down your hypersuperextra pc - have you ever tried to scope with the thermical feature of your beloved rifle? FORGET IT, it will freeze, making the shoot impossible /golfclap "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Campaign: Too short, but is the only next-gen thing about the game. 7/10 Multiplayer: Awful. 4/10 Squads: Very good, would be better if in another game. 8/10 Extinction: Okay. Either you like it or you don't. 6/10 Overall Innovation: The Create-A-Soldier and prestige system is my favorite of any game yet, but the rest of the game is 'meh'. 5/10 Graphics: I'm not a 'GRAPHICS ARE EVERYTHING RAWR' person, but seriosuly, couldn't be a LITTLE better? 5/10  AVERAGE SCORE: about 5.8/10  If it's on sale, money is no object, or you love CoD and have to get it, buy it. If not, then don't.  The first two DLC packs weren't great, but the last two were my fav. Either get the last two or, if you love Extinction, get the season pass.  P.S.  Oh yeah and BTW, it says I have 6 hours, that's for campaign. I have over 70 hours on Multiplayer, but it doesn't show that in the review because multiplayer pops up as a different game in Steam. If you have another modern CoD you probably know what I'm talking about."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Same formula ripped off from previous Call of Duty games.  I hate the feature that u need to frag people in order to use ur killstreaks. Its painfull.  Not worth paying for.   This game should be free.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,It is just waste of my money. i get all this stuff for CoD: Ghosts (season pass too) and no players online. so i cant recommend this game for anyone.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The campaign storyline was a brilliant concept, it had really intensive and epic moments it was well worth the play. However, there are major stability issues, the game has lots of screen tearing, FPS drops, and major clunky moments. I would give this game a 6/10 final score. 4 points were subtracted for loads of stability issues, I would of subtracted more, but the storyline deserved something."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,there is a flaw with multi player it does'nt matter if you meet full specks it still lags or crashes i bought it for a tenner from amazon but it is a pain i would not buy any dlc maps or add-ons till the problems are sorted so that probs means never also the cheats are still here
Call of Duty: Ghosts,is the multiplayer alive?  is it lag free?  are spawn points on point? is it worth the buy           YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  &nbsp;
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game falsly requires 6 gb of RAM or more when it only uses 2GB of RAM. When I play COD Black Ops 2 I have no lag or any issues that I can notice, but in this game, on even lower settings of all kinds, with 8GB of RAM, it runs at one frame a second, at best. This is is not optimized for PC and several years later Activision has not put out a patch to fix the game, so I cant even play this game that I'd spent $60 on. It's not Steam's fault, Activision has terrible customer service by not fixing this game. So unless you have a super good or expensive Alienware kind of gaming computer or better, stay away from this game, you will literally be throwing away your money."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty Ghosts is yet another title in an yearly cycle of COD games. Infinity ward this time have created a semi futuristic game with new graphics, and a more inovative muiltplayer. The customisation avaliable in muiltplayer is truely surpurb (best for a cod game yet) with new weapons, the ability to play as a girl for the first time, and brand new weapons never seen before. The maps are a true return to form for COD with larger maps allowing for more explorations, and the new dynamic features are also quite exciting. The campaign is average, but is still good if your a COD buff who plays the campaign before jumping into the muiltplayer. Extinction is an interesting change up, and although it will probably (most likely) never reach the heights of Zombies, it is a fun change up, with plenty of fun to be found in the single map that is currently being offered.   Rating: 4/10 :terrible pc port can go and rek itself"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Constant Freezes, every five to ten minutes of gameplay it freezes for 15 seconds. Seriously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Campaign is boring Multiplayer is garbage Extinction is mediocre Don't buy.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"What a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing poor optimization is this?   I can play higher req games on high or ultra settings, but i can't play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on low settings! CoD always sucks, older CoD games too."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Terrible Game aboslutely Broken. The amount of Lag is crazy even with my fairly high specs.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I'll save you a bunch of money. The single player is what you'd expect, and the multiplayer is more of a let down than porn buffering."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"To start off with, I haven't played this game a lot. A waste of 50 euro's. The game looks like all the other COD's, but at the same time it doesn't. Of course, multiplayer is the same as every other COD, but the weapons are purely made to dissapoint us. Unbalanced, some have stupid names and others are so weak that you can rather go into the battlefield without it (higher surviving chance). Singleplayer is stupid as af, just like the previous COD so 10/10"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I love all of the call of duty games but this must have been the worst one that you guys have made becuase first the guns are too op to many hackers lags every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 5 mins the way you have to buy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is dumb and the most of it is down have to time for my computer i have not played it when i got in a lobby and got kicked off game reason was nope my lobby yep hacker no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing way and now i just give up.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,Worst Call of Duty game ever. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Doesnt load, haven't been able to play a single minute. Dont buy....."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Graphics 4/10 Ugly Gameplay 4/10 Not much to do Weapons 3/10 Look weird Connection 3/10 Laggy Game is bad
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Give this game to someone who you hate so the trailer gets them excited for a terrible game
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why ummm cause i can not play multiplayer ... ^_- Servers not available this time ... what is wrong with your games nowadays I also have this on bop 2   I would 100% take a refund if i could.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I didn't have high expectations for this game as many of my friends said it was poor. I didn't buy it at first but then as it was on sale I thought I might as well. Well, at least I didn't get disappointed. The game actually is fairly poor I'm sorry to say. The AI on your teammates is sometimes so bad aswell. Sometimes you end up shooting nothing because enemies focus fire on you, and you die in 1-2 hits (1-2seconds.), which leaves you no time to shoot as you have to instantly crouch / prone back to cover. Sometimes you live 2seconds after a 'checkpoint' 10 times a row and it gets frustrating really quick. Sometimes they run in your line of fire, and on top of that, they give you really bad advices, and get you killed and what not, unlike in the other CoD games where they were actually useful. I also could not make out enemies from friendlies a lot of times!  The dog? I don't like dogs, and it was a major nuisance in the game. For couple of things, which I don't mention not to spoil even slightest. Guess it's hard to come up with new ideas that work anymore? I'm hoping Advanced Warfare will be better in this aspect, as there's more room for imagination.  The graphics and scenery were good, and I really enjoyed some scenes, but I had to play it on lowest sadly, as it was too laggy on even the normal, which is odd as my PC runs even BF4 smooth on normal graphics. Memory leak or bad code architecture? Or maybe it's made for consoles? Worked fine on lowest, but it ruined the good work done on scenery and graphics.   Now the story itself was okay, but nothing amazing. Basic CoD stuff. Multiplayer I won't even bother for lot of reasons, but I'm just bored of CoD MP for now. I also get the feeling that this game was pushed out without any testing. I'd recommend for the devs to play the game through, and see what needs to be fixed / changed. The new crouch-prone on 1 button was worth a try, but it's bad outcome. It doesn't work and gets you killed. Maybe it works better on MP.  65/100, poor for a CoD game, at least on PC. Put your money into something else."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Nah,why you put MP? It sucks,and you're still releasing DLC for it,maybe,if you will made this game with only SP and CO-OP,it will be nice"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"One of the weakest shooters I have ever played, If I could get my money back I would."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,But it has dogs and interactive fish
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"extinction was okay, multiplayer sucked @ss, and campaign was pretty fun, but it will never beat anything treyarch has made. ghosts is the poster child for sh*tty call of duties"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"So after playing the game, I must say I enjoyed it, you know the developers tried to make a good game. They added camos call-outs wolves and many other things. What they failed to do was focus on optimization. On pc this game is aweful. It will crash 3 or 4 times before it decides to boot and once the game is started there is no saying how long you will play before it breaks again. Now before people go saying its my hardware, tell that to my 16gb of RAM and twin r9 270's. On top of that multiplayer is dead with only 700 players on at a good time and the campaign wasnt the best. Now the worst part of this game, They dont nerf semi auto snipers but they nerf bolt actions? you made it easier for someone to snipe...  All in all, not worth the money (I even got in on sale for 30$ still not worth it.)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,DO not buy this SH8. it's not worth the money or the effort. lo player count on servers and campers in every corner.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game is sucked. I got it over christmas for 15$ so i didnt waste 60$ and of all the call of dutys this is the worst.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,i bought that game for 60$ and that baoring has hell pls lower the price becuse it isn't woth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Cod: Ghosts Multiplayer does not work..
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is full of campers, noobtubers and other anoyinng stuff. The PC version is so bad. And in domination at least every 3 games someone gets a KEM from Care Package, WTF. I would recommend picking up another COD or play on console. Activision does nothing for the PC versions of COD."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This is the worst game ever. Horribly slow servers and keeps kicking out. Now I have an permanent ban and cant use this game any more. Activision should be sued for this improper use of bans, and furthermore, steeling from customers by taking away the ability to play this game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty Ghosts is yet another title in an yearly cycle of COD games.

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought this game awhile back just now getting around to a review. As you can see I do not recommend this game, I paid the full 60 bucks for this and I regret it... that's for sure. There's nothing new here at all, story line is 'alright' gun play is dull feels like your tunnel shooting the whole time as in walk to the next person kill repeat. It's a neat concept (the main part of the story) why I was thinking about gettin it in the first place. Don't waste ur money! get BF4; better story-line, gun play is great Instead of this crap. 'Was looking forward to the next one there making for call of duty but after this think I'm good."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Fish AI, Dogs in your squad, Copy and Pasted Scenes From Previous Games?  What More Could You Possibly Ask For?  You won't ask for it, but what you will get is extreme regret for buying this piece of trash."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,And the award of the worst video game of the year goes to Call of Duty ghost congratulation Infinity ware!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's alright. Thats really all I have to say about this game. Not great controls with keyboard, buts runs very well on a good PC"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Such an awful game. Bugs, awful story. It did have some good missions. The eneding is the worst. You shoot Rorke IN THE CHEST and he lives. This game sucks goat balls. ITS A PILE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer is the biggest waste of money ever. With that the single player and co-op is it's only saving grace. Go buy BF4 if you want an decent FPS multiplayer experience. Personally i'm done with COD. This killed it for me.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Great multiplayer gameplay! Not so impressive campaign!! Almostno one plays this game now and I don't know why, in spite of the amazing online gameplay! Not recommened."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Can't play it, it locks up on the 1st video about ghosts. I just built this system, with an 8 core AMD FX cpu, 16GB DDR3 RAM, and a Nvidia GTX 560 Ti Vodeo card."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Why do I keep doing this? Is it the fond memories of MW that makes me think COD games will offer me a good fps experience? I don't know, but what I do know is that this is an unispired on rails shooter with an appalingly silly story. It has one redeeming feature, a dog, but even that can't save this game. I got to wise up and stop buying these things."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game just sucks. im really disappointed as Infinity Ward was the maker and they are usually on...but this one was way off. the controls and feel are just not smooth.   single player - well, the campaign is ehh. the storyline isnt all that great, and the characters are somewhat boring. the missions havent been anything like previous games where you'd want to replay them.  multiplayer - here is where the sh!t really starts to stink. the MP is dead for a reason. its awful. on top of the controls and feel being off, they have piled on garbage maps. there is nothing about the MP that makes you want to play it over any of the previous CoD games.    "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is bad, does not have a good story, there's isn't anything new to the franchise, just repeating what previous games did, and the textures... oh boy ... the textures look like they have been made in 2002, I've seen better textures in Spider-Man 2 (which I think its from 2004)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is totally trash. 1.It's only 5h of 'Campaign' gameplay. 2.In all this 5h of gameplay,you have to listen,going in certain ways and killing waves of soldiers.. 3.It's not crysis or robocop .. to be immortal ... in this game you are just a special soldier, without magic powers or super armors... but some how you can take a lot of bullets,granades,splashes,falling of from trains and killin like waves of 30-40 soldiers....i thing its based on 'Chuck Norris' movies,and it is so boring! COD Ghost has good graphics for its generation,but like the other 'COD' games its just graphics. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would pay the original price I paid for this game to take back the time I spent playing this game. This is THE worst game I have ever played. GRAPHICS: Hell the original COD had higher res textures in certain areas. STORY: The story is less indepth than the original doom. GAMEPLAY: This part is exceptional...ly bad, I played on hard and was bored the entire time."

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of duty Ghost  One of the worst game ever made by IW , MW was their best games why they cant make something like that anymore  -Short singleplayer campaign  -Lag , no dedicated server , lag and lag , dont have lot of weapon , hard-â™¥â™¥â™¥ gear set  -Co-op mode is lame  -Extinction mode are better than the game itself"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game laggs bad though aus internet sevices
Call of Duty: Ghosts,it sucks
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"nice game , be better if I didn't have to use task mngr to end task between every mission 3-4 times to continue game , what a turd...."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible spend your money on a dog or something instead.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Completed this last night around 6 hours. Iâ€™m so glad I only pay 10 dollars or less for these games because they are not worth more than that in my opinion. I find them somewhat enjoyable but predictable. This one started out pretty interesting but then fell for the same old COD formula pretty quickly. Graphics looked pretty good in some parts but in others it looked just liked MW1. The story was an incoherent pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but itâ€™s the set pieces that keeps me interested. We need more FPS space battles in games. I had a game breaking directx bug at the factory level and the only fix was to roll back my nvidia driver to 344.11 of course after I did that the game started showing weird artifacts. No FOV slider (WHAT A SHOCKER) and no separate volume controls YET AGAIN for music/dialog/effect â€œdesign decisionâ€ can suck my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Thank God for the guys at flawlesswidescreen who come out with these FOV fixes. You would think they guys at Sledgewardravenarch would have mastered a proper PC version after all these years and identical games. I donâ€™t understand why they havenâ€™t learned yet, do the devs just cover their ears and yell â€œLALALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU I CANT HEAR YOUâ€ to their customers?   Honestly I donâ€™t know why I keep playing these games, I guess Iâ€™m hoping for the glory days of the first CoD games or something like Allied Assault. All in all IF you only play single player like me this one gets a meh and can be skipped. I have no opinion on the MP, donâ€™t care."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Although I have 100 hours on this game.. I'm just not liking it anymore.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Recruit bots are difficult. Maps are beautiful. There is no lower setting for an easy game then recruit on this one. So prepare to be frustrated if you arn't a skilled player. Some customizations for female players, but limited."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Entire dev team is colourblind and can only tell the difference between light brown and grey.  Clearly designed this game on the immacualte power of a potato with an average of 14fps.  Honeybadger is a cool name for a gun.  2/10 IGN  
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THis game sucks 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Get VAC and Dev. banned for launching game. Too scared to play ever again, cannot recommend.  R.I.P Extinction. It was fun while it lasted."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,no one even playes every one camps and uses launchers waste of money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The ending made me cry.   Of tears of joy, because it was over."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game sucks can't even noscope
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"If you like outdated graphics, lag, game breaking bugs and 'boots to the ground' gameplay, buy this game. You see, I am not all negative about it :P"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Got Banned because of an Fov Changer 10/10. PS 80 fov is not enough for me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Just 500 people online
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Thisnis the worst call of duty ever. It is an embarrasment not only to the creators but to the players as well. First off the maps are way too big and there all the same: destroyed urban maps. And the engine is bloaty. And extinction is just plain stupid
Call of Duty: Ghosts,very poor pc optimization END OF. can not even exit fullscreen without whole pc coking up
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Good thing I bought it, Now I have a new game I can just hate all day."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Recruit bots are difficult. Maps are beautiful. There is no lower setting for an easy game then recruit on this one. So prepare to be frustrated if you arn't a skilled player. Some customizations for female players, but limited."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a fâ™¥â™¥â™¥ing piece of shâ™¥t!! dont buy this please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WORST GAME EVER MADE!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer? full of r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d campers and full of hackers.  Singleplayer? That's Ok Optimization? bullsht
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game isn't worth any money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OMG i dont know where is my money &lt;&gt; . Bobby return my money!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,even torrenting this cr*p is not worth it
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This really wasn't a good game. The campaign has too many cliches (at this point I'd rather a good single game story over one with cliffhangers) and it was a complete chore to beat. The multiplayer was laggy and had nothing new, and no part of Ghosts made me feel happy I was playing it"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It's Call of Duty. What can I say?  Ghosts has a really silly plot, really silly setting, really silly over-the-top action and it's just the sort of mindless violence-candy one might want every now and then. The game tells the tale of how the big bad South America united against the poor ol' underdog USA and stole the US's secret space weapons tech and... boy... that WAS really stupid!  Oh, and if you like dogs, don't get this game. I love dogs and it broke my heart to have to 'control' a dog at one point, tearing out the throats of a couple dozen people who were just doing their jobs. The dog in this game LOOKS adorable, but it is a cold-blooded murder-monster and I hate it. Screw the dog!  A lot of the special effects, such as fire and explosions, even at the highest settings, look like poorly made transparent gifs overlaid on top of the 3D models. I'm guessing this is some sort of tweak made for parity with the console versions, considering how noticeable the effect is.  I can't recommend Ghosts simply because the older Call of Duties did pretty much all the same things, but better. Except for the space shooting, that was pretty badass.   Playtime: 6+ hours (single playthrough)   Ratings (1-10) Visual: 7 Audio: 8 Story: 5 Gameplay: 7 Overall: 7   *** DOG - SPOILER ***  The dog does not die! It just gets forgotten about really quickly and then just sort of disappears for the latter half of the game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. once the new COD came out the game would no longer play, after a few months it would play, but youde get banned VAC almost instantly. biggest scam ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,I LOVE THIS GAME!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty bad game, even worse cod game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,OMG i dont know where is my money &lt;&gt; . Bobby return my money!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Dis game suck without infinity ward Blackops 2 is still the best of all !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Call of Duty: Ghosts,a fâ™¥â™¥â™¥ing piece of shâ™¥t!! dont buy this please
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"This game is totally trash. 1.It's only 5h of 'Campaign' gameplay. 2.In all this 5h of gameplay,you have to listen,going in certain ways and killing waves of soldiers.. 3.It's not crysis or robocop .. to be immortal ... in this game you are just a special soldier, without magic powers or super armors... but some how you can take a lot of bullets,granades,splashes,falling of from trains and killin like waves of 30-40 soldiers....i thing its based on 'Chuck Norris' movies,and it is so boring! COD Ghost has good graphics for its generation,but like the other 'COD' games its just graphics. "
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I would pay the original price I paid for this game to take back the time I spent playing this game. This is THE worst game I have ever played. GRAPHICS: Hell the original COD had higher res textures in certain areas. STORY: The story is less indepth than the original doom. GAMEPLAY: This part is exceptional...ly bad, I played on hard and was bored the entire time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,sooooooooo unoptimized one of the worst ports ive ever seen.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,2/10 would not buy - lag compensation ruins it - horrible 'hosts' - lied about dedicated servers - horrible graphics
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"like pulling teeth, 6 hours of gameplay I had to stretch over about 2 years because I couldnt sit through more than 1/2-1 level at a time."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. once the new COD came out the game would no longer play, after a few months it would play, but youde get banned VAC almost instantly. biggest scam ever."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Pretty bad game, even worse cod game."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Why are you even looking at this game?
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst part of Call Of Duty ! Very poor perfomance !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"You killed CoD , You â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Waste of Money and waste of time. No doubt this game has the highest discounts and is sold at around 5â‚¬.  If you're looking for a great Call of Duty game, look up for the Treyarch's Call of Duty (Black Ops series).  If you're looking for a cheap Call of Duty game, then you shouldn't buy Call of Duty. There ain't nothing cheap here that is worth to buy!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Call Of Duty Ghost to most people this is the game that started the down fall of COD to most people this was there least played and most hated Call Of Duty Made but i think people judged the game to early as it isnt that bad of a game now that all the bugs and glitches have been sorted but that doesnt mean that it is nwo perfect there is still things that could be changed like the IED and Dog being far to over power the person that though that the dog needed more health than the player is an idiot and the person that came up with the idea of the IED need to get there head checked and also the Maps in the game are far to big compaired to the player count if it was a 12 v 12 i would under stand the big maps but the fact that its a 6v6 on most gamemodes made it insanly hard to fin anyone and when you do find someone they are normaly sitting in a dark corner waiting to kill you with a LMG with a thermal scope and and this is because the colour scheme is so bland and gray that its hard to spot people that are camping or lying on the floor so would i recomend this game If youn only want to play TDM and thats it Yes go for it but if you dont then No
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Complete garbage. Easily the worst CoD game to date and simply not worth your time or money. Avoid this like the plague and play a better CoD game if that's what you're into.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,More like a ghost in that I don't wanna see it  0/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Story is alright but multiplayer is down for me
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Bought it, installed it, tried to launch it.. nothing happens not even an error. only preparing to launch and syncing after that nothing happens at all.  please fix it. can someone help?   "

Call of Duty: Ghosts,"It pains me to say this, because I truly enjoyed this game during it's prime, but I cannot in, good faith, reccomend this game. Earlier in the game's life, performance was terrible. Sub-30 framerates were common on extremely powerful graphics cards. However, it seems that as of late, some patches have come out that completely fix the framerate issue, because I'm consistently bumping the FPS cap of ninety-one. Now, a new problem persists - no playerbase. There is nobody here. During the middle of the day, on a *weekend*, there are two-hundred players. That's simply unplayable. If you really want to play Ghosts, pick it up on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The game is bad, does not have a good story, there's isn't anything new to the franchise, just repeating what previous games did, and the textures... oh boy ... the textures look like they have been made in 2002, I've seen better textures in Spider-Man 2 (which I think its from 2004)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The sad truth is, Call of Duty campaigns and its general gameplay has lacked meaningful innovation for quite a long time. This entry is no different. While they have introduced Squads (which is, I admit, a very intriguing mode to try out), don't expect any daring attempt at innovation. In the end, this is yet another blatant money grab for our pockets, whilst 'playing it safe' by staying to the 'tried and true' Call of Duty formula.   As for the graphics...they are about what you would expect for a Call of Duty title. Had I not known it was a new engine, I would never have guessed, as the graphics look quite dated when matched against other recently released games.   The Story for the single player campaign also was quite unengaging, sticking close to all of the Call of Duty cliches. There was no exciting or unpredictable twists, no real attempt by the writers to get me to connect with the characters in the story. In fact, about halfway through the campaign, I realized that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, or even what would happen in the larger scope of the war that was going on. It was a huge disconnect, and In short, it was quite boring.   As always, multiplayer is interesting, though again, do not expect any surprises. They make some changes, sure, but not large enough changes to really change the formulaic call of duty approach. Thus, if you've played multiplayer on call of duty at any time over the last 3 or 4 years, you can consider yourself to have pretty much experienced this year's rendition of it as well.   Because of the lack of MEANINGFUL innovation in its campaign or multiplayer, its lack of an engaging story, its lack of engaging characters, and its lack of graphical innovation, I have given this game a score of 2 out of 10. Call of Duty needs to break new ground. Innovate!"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The only thing I can say for this game is it is one of the worst games Ive every played ever, and Ive played goat sim!  DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT IS ON SALE! THE PINICAL OF THE SERIES WAS CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS II Buy that instead of better more get AW"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Cool singleplayer storyline, but the rest unfortunately lacks a lot."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst cod of all.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,worst part of Call Of Duty ! Very poor perfomance !
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WORST GAME EVER MADE!
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Multiplayer? full of r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d campers and full of hackers.  Singleplayer? That's Ok Optimization? bullsht
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game isn't worth any money
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The only 2 good things this game did for me was forcing me to install Win 7 64-bit and curing my CoD addiction.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,The Sonic '06 of the Xbox One.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Don't buy this unless you want to play campaign. Unoptimized, runs like bull chocolate, multiplayer is almost dead (500-800 players avg).  I got banned yesterday for using FOV changer. MW2 and MW3 are way better than this and I didn't get banned for using FOV changer.   Play CoD4 or something else before Ghosts (2013) (from CoD4 MW (2007) to BO2 (2012), anything else which isn't AW, or creepy Ghosts.)"
Call of Duty: Ghosts,WTF! I got it when I bought it :(  #DONT BUY
Call of Duty: Ghosts,THIS GAME IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WHY DA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DID THEY RELEASE THIS?????
Call of Duty: Ghosts,This game forced me to take a two year break from C.O.D's anual releases.
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Call of Duty was one of the greatest franchises around. I used the term was simply because Ghost is lacking the realism that it's predicessors in the modern warfare and regular call of duty series had. Don't get me wrong it is an OK game, but it doesn't live up to the call of duty standards. This is the last one I will ever buy, because I've seen the new releases of call of duty and they're not deemed fit to wipe my a s s with. Note to Infinity Ward Listen to the veteran players that know gaming and not your gut feelings."
Call of Duty: Ghosts,Once again the same call of duty game with a different name. AND AGAIN a big let down... i just dont understand what is with this hype train. 11/10 would delete any other COD games after playing it for a hour. If you have any questions how I gave any rating feel free to comment. Please keep in mind that this is my personal preferences:  Story: 6 Gameplay: 7 Voice Acting/Music: 8 Graphics: 8 Depth: 2 Flexibility: 2 Reward System: n/a   Total: 5.5/10
Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer sucks, matchmaking sucks Everytime I join a game, I never get any smooth game If not a massive server lag, I get lag spikes all over the place Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money, horrible, worst call of duty ever 1/10"
